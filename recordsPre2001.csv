Beckers et al.,2000,Journal of Hydrology,simulating groundwater flow and runoff for the oro moraine aquifer system. part i. model formulation and conceptual analysis,"a steady state groundwater model that incorporates the vadose zone in an approximate fashion is developed to account for situations where recharge may be significantly affected by heterogeneity above the watertable. the model is intended for basin scale applications where the exact representation of the unsaturated zone is no longer feasible. the pseudo unsaturated model is compared to a variably saturated model making use of an idealized cross section approximating the complex oro moraine aquifer system. differences in predicted flow regimes between the two models arise from the coarser mesh used in the pseudo unsaturated simulations, but are minimal below the watertable. the pseudo unsaturated model yields an accurate overall system water mass balance although a loss in spatial resolution of predicted fluxes may occur. such accuracy losses are offset by drastically lower computer memory requirements. the flow simulations further show that near surface heterogeneity has a profound impact on the sustainable capacity of a groundwater system and the location of sensitive recharge areas. the pseudo unsaturated model is then coupled to a high conductivity layer atop the model domain to simulate rainfall runoff. an important advantage of this model formulation is that precipitation and evapotranspiration measurements can be directly used as model input, while groundwater infiltration is part of the flow solution. runoff and baseflow contributions to long term streamflow generation are also calculated and can be compared to data from gauging stations during model calibration.

Blackwell et al.,2000,Journal of Hydrology,"management of water repellency in australia, and risks associated with preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching","the three most westerly states of southern australia have the largest area of water repellent soils, which limit agricultural production, of any country in the world. simplified principles of the problems caused by repellency and the principles of soil management solutions are considered and related to experimental evidence. the phenomena of diverted soil water flow and isolated dry soil can explain most of the problems caused by repellency. plant adaptation, soil or hydrophobic removal, reduced soil drying, reduced surface tension, water harvesting, avoidance, masking and, perhaps, water movement along dead root systems are the main soil management principles. dead roots may play a role in zero till cropping systems, allowing more uniform wetting of dry hydrophobic soil at the base of a dead plant and along the dendritic pattern of the dead root system. application of these management principles, especially water harvesting, avoidance and masking (by the use of deep trenching, furrow sowing methods or claying), have made a considerable improvement to sustainability and productivity of farming systems on the water repellent soils of australia. evidence is selected to assess risks of preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching for different agricultural soil management methods. all management methods can have some risks, but claying seems to have the least risk and furrowing the highest risk of encouraging preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching. it is suggested we have insufficient information and understanding to quantify the risks of groundwater contamination for different environments, farming systems and soil management methods to control repellency. there is an urgent need to develop quantified guidelines to minimise any possible groundwater contamination hazard for the extensive areas using farming systems with furrows and increasing amounts of pesticide and fertiliser.

Briggs et al.,1993,Applied Geography,sustainable development and resource management in marginal environments   natural resources and their use in the wadi allaqi region of egypt,"the aim of the paper is to assess the nature and suitability of the natural resource base of a fragile environment for sustainable economic development. the situation is further complicated by the fact that groundwater conditions in the study area, the southeastern desert of egypt, have been radically altered since the construction of the aswan high dam. results show that soil conditions in the area will support both vegetation and crops over short periods of time, although further work is needed on long term sustainability. there are three main sources of water in the area: surfacewater from lake nasser; shallow groundwater, associated with lake nasser; and ancient groundwater at depth in the nubian sandstone. it is the former two which offer the most realistic development options. vegetation resources offer opportunities for grazing, charcoal production and medicinal uses. the perceptions and attitudes of the local people of the area, as well as their livelihood patterns, make up a major element of the proposed development plan of the area."

Calder et al.,1997,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,eucalyptus water use greater than rainfall input a possible explanation from southern india,"hydrological and silvicultural studies carried out in southern india on the effects of plantations of eucalyptus and other fast growing exotic tree species have determined the impacts of these plantations on water resources, erosion, soil nutrient status and growth rates at sites of differing rainfall and soil depth in karnataka. whilst providing new information on these issues, the studies also raised two important questions: what was the explanation for the anomalous result that the water use of 3400 mm from eucalyptus plantations at hosakote over a three year period exceeded the rainfall of 2100 mm over the same period and why were growth rates of woodlots on most farmer's fields higher than those of plantations on land owned by the karnataka forest department? the records of the soil moisture depletion patterns under these plantations from the day of planting provide the basis for the answers to both questions: i) whilst roots are penetrating into deeper soil layers, they are able to extract from a reservoir of water additional to that available from the rainfall each year, ii) farmer's land on which short rooted agricultural crops have been grown previously is likely to have a much higher soil water status than land previously under forest or scrub vegetation. these new studies have also established that the development of the drying front under the eucalyptus camaldulensis plantations is very rapid, indicating average root extension rates in excess of 2.5 m per year, whilst those under tectona grandis and artocarpus heterophyllus advanced at approximately half the rate. these results have obvious implications for the long term sustainability of growth rates from these plantations and the recharge of groundwater. the authors believe that this study may be the first to report neutron probe soil moisture depletion observations, from the date of planting, beneath tree plantations in a dry climate. the extent to which the roots were able to penetrate raises the question of whether other studies, which have estimated water use from soil moisture observations in dry climates, may have seriously underestimated both the actual soil moisture depletion and the water use through having soil moisture measurements located to insufficient depth."

DasGupta et al.,1997,Hydrological Sciences Journal-Journal Des Sciences Hydrologiques,sustainable groundwater resources development,"sustainable groundwater resources development implies use of groundwater as a source of water supply, on a long term basis, in an efficient and equitable manner sustaining its quality and environmental diversity. an understanding of the behaviour of a groundwater system and of its interaction with the environment is required to formulate a sustainable management plan. mathematical models supported by field information play a key role in assessing the future behaviour of a system to stresses and to find effective operating conditions for sustainable development and management of groundwater resources. basic principles for sustainable development are stressed and a brief review of two case studies is provided to illustrate how a systems approach and its computational framework of mathematical models can be used in addressing the main issue of water allocation satisfying some of the technical and environmental constraints."
deVries et al.,1997,Geologische Rundschau,prediction in hydrogeology: two case histories,"an inherent aspect of hydrogeology is the dynamic character of groundwater flow within the more passive lithospheric medium. prediction therefore requires insight into the spatial pattern of aquifer properties as well as the dynamic character of groundwater flow systems. both aspects together determine hydrogeological system behaviour in space and time. the spatial characteristics of an aquifer are mainly based on geological and geomorphological structure, whereas the dynamics of the system result predominantly from climate and topography; knowledge of paleoconditions are a prerequisite for sound understanding of present systems. the integration of exploration and forecast is illustrated by two case studies. the first study focuses on an assessment of groundwater resource and their sustainable development in semi arid botswana. the second study concerns the impact of land and water management in the netherlands coastal area on the groundwater regime and its future development, including the redistribution of salt and fresh groundwater on a long time scale."

Foster et al.,1997,Journal of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management,groundwater resources: balancing perspectives on key issues affecting supply and demand,"sustainable groundwater management requires (a) maximizing the use of aquifer storage to reduce water supply costs while limiting environmental impacts, and (b) maximizing groundwater protection to reduce water supply treatment needs while not unduly restricting landuse activities. these key issues are evaluated from the experience of a recent and comprehensive national strategic study involving detailed consultation with many stakeholders with an interest in groundwater resources. such balances are not easy to achieve because groundwater systems are complex to analyse and slow to respond to change, resulting in considerable uncertainty in assessment and prediction without in depth research and high resolution monitoring. current institutional and regulatory arrangements for the water sector in england and wales do not appear to be achieving the best possible use of aquifer storage and optimal investment in groundwater protection."

Gharbi et al.,1994,Water Resources Research,integrated embedding optimization applied to salt lake valley aquifers,"the embedding optimization modeling approach is adapted to aid sustainable groundwater quantity and quality management of complex nonlinear multilayer aquifers. implicit block centered finite difference approximations of the quasi three dimensional unsteady flow equation and galerkin finite element approximations of the two dimensional advection dispersion transport equation are embedded directly as constraints in the model. also used are nonlinear constraints describing river aquifer interflow, evapotranspiration, and vertical flow reduction due to unconfinement. these circumvent use of large numbers of integer variables. the use of both linear and nonlinear formulations in a cyclical manner reduces execution time and improves confidence in solution optimality. the methodology is demonstrated for salt lake valley where groundwater quantity and quality management are needed, the proportion of pumping cells and cells needing head constraint is large, and many flows are described by discrete nonlinear or piecewise linear functions."
Ghassemi et al.,1991,Environment International,human induced salinization and the use of quantitative methods,"sustainable development of the earth's limited water and land resources is of paramount importance because of rising world population and existing conflicting demands for these resources. enormous capital investment has been made in developing these resources, but now there is irrefutable evidence that such developments have led to major resource degradation. this includes problems of salinisation and damages to ecosystems. the countries predominantly affected by human induced salinisation are located in arid and semi arid regions of the world and include australia, china, egypt, india, pakistan, ussr, and usa. this paper describes the processes of salinisation, its impacts and the use of quantitative methods in salinity investigation and management. australia is used as a case study of typical salinity problems and as a demonstration of the fruitful application of quantitative methods. the paper concludes that quantitative methods such as surfacewater and groundwater models are powerful design, management and predictive tools in salinity investigation. however, application of some models, such as those for unsaturated flow and transport and groundwater solute transport, are not widespread due to uncertainties in describing the complexity of the processes and the lack of hydrodispersive data."

Lee et al.,1999,Journal of Hydrology,"using h  and o isotopic data for estimating the relative contributions of rainy and dry season precipitation to groundwater: example from cheju island, korea","a comparison of deuterium excess or d values of precipitation and groundwater at cheju island, korea, indicates that, unlike in many temperate climates, precipitation during the whole year contributes to groundwater recharge. this in turn suggests that evapotranspiration effects are minimal, consistent with the fact that the island contains highly permeable volcanic rocks overlain by thin soils. this hypothesis is contrary to current waterbudget models that ascribe a significant role to evapotranspiration processes. three coastal springs, and several streams and ponds throughout the island have enriched delta o 18 and delta d values that plot off the local meteoric water line and have relatively high cl concentrations. this relationship is suggestive of seawater mixing for the coastal springs and evaporation for the streams and ponds. this database thus provides a useful means for evaluation of groundwater resources of the island.

McCartney et al.,1998,Journal of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management,an assessment of groundwater recharge on the channel island of jersey,"on the channel island of jersey a third of the total water requirements are obtained from groundwater sources. a reliable estimate of recharge is necessary for sustainable groundwater management. past resource management has been limited, partly because the rate of recharge is uncertain. this paper describes the application of three independent methods of estimating recharge: (a) chloride balance, (b) stream baseflow analysis, and (c) rainfall recharge runoff simulation. all three methods produce reasonably consistent results, indicating that long term recharge is 16 19% of average annual rainfall, and results of modelling indicate that groundwater abstraction may have exceeded recharge in 5 out of 28 years. these findings have important implications for the management of the island's water resources."
McCartney et al.,1999,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,water flow pathways and the waterbalance within a headwater catchment containing a dambo: inferences drawn from hydrochemical investigations,"dambos, seasonally saturated wetlands, are widespread in headwater catchments in sub saharan africa. it is widely believed that they play an important role in regional hydrology but, despite research conducted over the last 25 years, their hydrological functions remain poorly understood. to improve conceptualisation of hydrological flow paths and investigate the waterbalance of a small zimbabwean catchment containing a single dambo, measurements of alkalinity and chloride in different water types within the catchment have been used as chemical markers. the temporal variation in alkalinity is consistent with the premise that all stream water, including the prolonged dry season recession, is derived predominantly from shallow sources. the proposition that dry season recession flows are maintained by water travelling at depth within the underlying saprolite is not substantiated. there is evidence that a low permeability clay lens, commonly present in many dambos, acts as a barrier for vertical water exchange. however, the highly heterogeneous chemical composition of different waters precludes quantitative hydrograph splitting using end member mixing analysis. calculation of the chloride mass balance confirms that, after rainfall, evaporation is the largest component of the catchment waterbudget. the study provides improved understanding of the hydrological functioning of dambos. such understanding is essential for the development and implementation of sustainable management strategies for this landform."
Melloul et al.,2000,Water Science and Technology,a proposal for sustainable groundwater management as influenced by a pyramid of social needs: the case of israel's coastal aquifer,"the psychologist abraham maslow developed a pyramid of human social needs. a comparable pyramidal hierarchy of groundwater needs can be envisaged. in the pyramid of social needs, until lower level needs are fulfilled, higher level needs remain irrelevant to people. analogously. only once a society's basic groundwater concerns are fulfilled can groundwater management decision makers hope to press onwards towards an ultimate goal of attaining sustainable groundwater resources development. groundwater resources of the sharon region of israel's coastal aquifer can be taken as a case in point. to effectively carry out management recommendations for achieving sustainable groundwater development. technical concerns must be integrated with social concerns. alignment between comparable levels of the pyramids of social and groundwater needs can only be achieved by educating the society to perceive the significance of sustainable resource development for future generations. only then will the society be fully prepared to pay the price for such development and to participate in the long term environmental planning required."
Melloul et al.,2000,Hydrological Sciences Journal-Journal Des Sciences Hydrologiques,sustainable groundwater management of the stressed coastal aquifer in the gaza region,"this study proposes an empirical approach that can lead to the sustainable management of groundwater resources. this approach enables a comprehensive understanding of an aquifer, delineates distinct hydrological scenarios, and recommends a set of operational activities for each sub region of the aquifer. the paper focuses on the coastal aquifer of the gaza strip region which has been divided into three sub regions. the southern sub region (wsw) is classified as scenario ""+a2"" which indicates that it can be used as a multi annual groundwater reservoir. the northern sub region (nw e) is designated scenario "" a2"", where the recommended operational measures include injection of freshwater in wells and cleaning of the surface environment. the third sub region (cse), is classified as scenario "" b2"", which requires severe management measures to correct both a negative hydrological and environmental situation. the approach also involves on going monitoring of the aquifer, and can be considered as an empirical tool to provide preliminary guidelines for long term groundwater management."

Musharrafieh et al.,1995,Water Resources Research,optimizing irrigation management for pollution control and sustainable crop yield,"irrigation strategies which maximize crop yield while preventing salt from leaching to the groundwater or undesirable salt increases in the root zone are computed by using a one dimensional simulation/optimization management model. the included constraint equations maintain a water volume balance and salt transport in the unsaturated zone. implicit finite difference forms of the unsaturated water flow equation (richards' equation), the diffusion convection solute transport equation, functions describing the hydraulic properties of the medium, a root extraction function, and other constraints are used. the model uses a large discretization in time. a cyclic prediction and correction type of approach is adopted to eliminate the inaccuracy that would otherwise result from the coarse discretization. as a result of the procedure presented, intercell water and mass flux rates in the optimization model have the same accuracy as those in a more finely discretized simulation model. the model is applied to a research farm in huntington, utah, where salty water is used for irrigation. in that process detailed soil water and salt profiles are computed and spatially distributed moisture content and concentration constraints are satisfied."
Ridgley et al.,1992,Environment and Planning B-Planning & Design,linking waterbalance simulation and multiobjective programming   landuse plan design in hawaii,"in the hawaiian islands, planners and public officials have decided recently to raise the permissible level of urban development in central oahu. the decision is opposed by many on the grounds that it threatens agricultural land as well as the sustainability of groundwater supply. a two part procedure is presented for exploring the impacts of such development and designing urban expansion patterns that minimize them. first, a waterbalance simulation model is used to calculate groundwater recharge as it varies with landuse and location within the area. the difference between recharge and withdrawal is computed, and any changes are then estimated for different landuses. this information is then incorporated into optimization models having objectives related to agricultural land retention, groundwaterbalance, and residential population growth. the models generate alternative landuse expansion plans and show the trade offs among objectives. the consideration of slightly suboptimal (dominated) solutions allows a significant expansion in the range of such alternatives. the results suggest that, if future agricultural development does not occur on currently nonagricultural land, then both agricultural land and groundwater sustainability will suffer significant adverse effects under the new population limits."

Sikdar et al.,2000,Journal of the Geological Society of India,geology of the quaternary aquifers of the twin city of calcutta howrah,"the twin city of calcutta howrah is underlain by a succession of quaternary sediments consisting of clay, silt, fine to coarse sand and occasional gravel. below these sediments at depths beyond 296 m, there is a thick sequence of pliocene clay. the top clay bed of quaternary sequence contains peaty intercalations indicating bog or marshy condition at depths of 2   5 m and 12   12.6 m. the peal layers were deposited during the period c.3990 years b.p, to c. 7030 years b.p. grain size analysis of the sandy horizons indicates that the sands were deposited in a fluvial environment. lithofacies analysis of the quaternary sediments indicates that the gravelly sand horizons occurring in e   w and nne   ssw trends in the depth range of 80 120 m are potential aquifer zones. these two trends of deposition of very coarse sediments probably indicate the route of sediment movement where high energy condition prevailed. the sandy sediments at a depth span of 24 to 81 m are yellowish to brownish coloured suggesting oxidising conditions of deposition. the sediments occurring above and below this horizon are grey to light grey in colour indicating reducing conditions of deposition. the over extraction of groundwater from the aquifer has resulted in the change of the groundwater flow pattern from an ""open"" system in 1956 to a ""closed"" one in 1993 with the formation of a groundwater trough in the south central part of calcutta. based on depth of the aquifers, status of the piezometric surface, lithofacies and grain size ratio, an aquifer development plan has been proposed fora sustainable groundwater development in the twin city."
Simmons et al.,1998,Journal of Hydrology,"modelling density dependent flow and solute transport at the lake tutchewop saline disposal complex, victoria","intercepted saline groundwaters and drainage effluent from irrigation are commonly stored in both natural and artificial saline disposal basins throughout the murray darling basin of australia. their continued use as wastewater evaporation sites requires an understanding of existing groundwater dynamics. the useful lifetimes of individual basins, their sustainability and possible environmental impacts remain largely unknown. in this work, the movement of salt to the underlying groundwater system from lake tutchewop, a saline disposal complex in north central victoria, was modelled in cross section. due to the salinity contrast between the hypersaline basin waters and the regional groundwater, it was necessary to simulate density dependent flow behaviour. under certain conditions, these density stratified systems may become unstable leading to the onset of convective behaviour, which greatly increases the movement of salt from the basin to the groundwater system. modelled concentration profiles in the aquifer system and calculated seepage rates from the basin show that lake tutchewop is stable under its present operating regime. the downward movement of salt is mainly controlled by diffusion and dispersion. the calibrated model was used to assess the impact of several management scenarios using time dependent boundarycondition for lake salinity and water levels. the influence of heterogeneous basin linings on ensuing salt flux rates is examined, and results show that increased solute transport will occur under such conditions. a sensitivityanalysis performed on governing variables showed that salt fluxes were most sensitive to lake salinity levels. a solute rayleigh number defined in terms of basin salinity and hydrogeologic parameters is seen to be an effective tool for predicting the long term behaviour of such saline disposal basins. the models and concepts developed in this work may find application in the design and management of saline disposal complexes.

Sophocleous et al.,2000,Journal of Hydrology,from safe yield to sustainable development of water resources   the kansas experience,"this paper presents a synthesis of water sustainability issues from the hydrologic perspective. it shows that safe yield is a flawed concept and that sustainability is an idea that is broadly used but perhaps not well understood. in general, the sustainable yield of an aquifer must be considerably less than recharge if adequate amounts of water are to be available to sustain both the quantity and quality of streams, springs, wetlands, and groundwater dependent ecosystems. to ensure sustainability, it is imperative that water limits be established based on hydrologic principles of mass balance. to establish water use policies and planning horizons, the transition curves of aquifer systems from groundwater storage depletion to induced recharge of surfacewater need to be developed. present day numerical models are capable of generating such transition curves. several idealized examples of aquifer systems show how this could be done. because of the complexity of natural systems and the uncertainties in characterizing them, the current philosophy underlying sustainable management of water resources is based on the interconnected systems approach and on adaptivemanagement. examples of water resources management from kansas illustrate some of these concepts in a real world setting. some of the hallmarks of kansas water management are the formation of local groundwater management districts, the adoption of minimum streamflow standards, the use of modified safe yield policies in some districts, the implementation of integrated resource planning by the city of wichita, and the subbasin water resources manage ment program in potential problem areas. these are all appropriate steps toward sustainable development. the kansas examples show that local decision making is the best way to fully account fur local variability in water management. however, it is imperative that public education and involvement be encouraged, so that system complexities and constraints an better understood and overly simplistic solutions avoided.

Sutherland et al.,1996,Journal of Water Supply Research and Technology-Aqua,cost effective monitoring and maintenance strategies for groundwater abstraction,"there is an increased awareness world wide of the need for cost effective, functional and sustainable groundwater abstraction. there have been recent reviews and updating of the technology involved, but less attention on integrating technical aspects with economic and management options. this is vital when assessing monitoring, operation and maintenance strategies. a key element in strategy development is the evaluation of the cost effectiveness of the options available. this paper discusses the issues involved and describes a spreadsheet based methodology for evaluating the cost effectiveness of various monitoring and maintenance strategies for the management of water supply boreholes. case studies are presented to illustrate the working of the method and issues arising from its use."
Taylor et al.,1996,Journal of Hydrology,groundwater recharge in the victoria nile basin of east africa: support for the soil moisture balance approach using stable isotope tracers and flow modelling,"across equatorial africa, increasing demand for groundwater has raised concerns about resource sustainability and has highlighted the need for reliable estimates of groundwater recharge. recharge investigations in this environment are typically inhibited by a shortage of good quality meteorological and hydrogeological records. moreover, when recharge studies are attempted they tend to rely on a single technique and frequently lack corroborating evidence to substantiate recharge predictions. in recent studies undertaken in the aroca catchment of the victoria nile basin in central uganda, the timing and magnitude of recharge determined by a soil moisture balance approach are supported by stable isotope data and groundwater flow modelling. the soil moisture balance study reveals that recharge averages in the order of 200 mm year( 1) and is more dependent on the number of heavy (more than 10 mm day( 1)) rainfall events than the total annual volume of rainfall. stable isotope data suggest independently that recharge occurs during the heaviest rains of the monsoons, and further establish that recharge stems entirely from the direct infiltration of rainfall, an assumption implicit in the soil moisture balance approach. deforestation over the last 30 years is shown to have more than doubled the recharge estimate. aquifer flow modelling supports the recharge estimates but demonstrates that the vast majority (over 99%) of recharging waters must be transmitted by the aquifer in the regolith rather the underlying bedrock fractures which have traditionally been developed for rural water supplies."
