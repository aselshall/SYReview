Hu et al.,2019,Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management,role of heterogeneous behavioral factors in an agent based model of crop choice and groundwater irrigation,"unsustainable groundwater use has led to the lowering of groundwater levels and the degradation of groundwater dependent ecosystems worldwide. integrated hydrologic ecological economic models have been developed to simulate and optimize the coupled human and groundwater systems, and address the issue of unsustainable groundwater use. however, a lack of understanding of the heterogeneity of groundwater users undermines the performance of the integrated models. in this paper, an agent based model is developed using a two stage optimization strategy with the goal of optimizing the decision making of heterogeneous farmers on crop choice and groundwater irrigation. the performance of the optimization strategy is evaluated under the influence of four behavioral factors. the results illustrate that the optimization strategy can lead to higher crop profits or a slower rate of groundwater depletion in comparison with the observations, but does not necessarily guarantee the optimal solution in balancing these two objectives. in order to achieve sustainable groundwater use, the roles that behavioral factors play in farmers' decision making need to be better understood, and better accounted for in groundwater policy.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0
Cobbing et al.,2018,South African Journal of Science,the grootfontein aquifer: governance of a hydro social system at nash equilibrium,"the grootfontein groundwater aquifer is important to the water supply of the town mahikeng in the north west province of south africa and to commercial agriculture in the province, but the watertable has fallen by up to 28 m as a consequence of over abstraction since the 1980s. institutional and hydrogeological issues impact the aquifer in complex ways, described here as a hydro social system. whilst the hydrogeology is well understood and south african laws provide for sustainable groundwater governance, poor stakeholder collaboration and other institutional problems mean that the over abstraction is likely to persist   an example of an undesirable nash equilibrium. the grootfontein aquifer case shows that groundwater underpins wider social ecological economic systems, and that more holistic management   taking the institutional context into account   is needed to underpin economic growth, employment and other public outcomes. significance: the cost of better natural resource stewardship, including groundwater, is likely to be considerably less than the losses that occur when it is absent. if local groundwater was better managed, it could make water supplies in mahikeng cheaper and more reliable, which would in turn support local economic growth and employment.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
Knuppe et al.,2016,Environmental Policy and Governance,sustainable groundwater management: a comparative study of local policy changes and ecosystem services in south africa and germany,"groundwater dependent ecosystem services provide benefits to human well being and play a key role in regulating ecosystem processes and functions. improving groundwater management is of fundamental importance to reduce ecological trade offs and to avoid long term negative consequences for societies. in this context, local groundwater policies as well as multi level governance processes play a key role. this article provides an improved understanding of how local policies change in response to social ecological drivers and how these changes contribute to the sustainable provision of groundwater dependent ecosystem services. within this context, we analyze recent changes in local groundwater policies in the sandveld region (south africa) and the spreewald region (germany) from a multi level governance perspective. in both cases a combination of drivers   in particular ecological degradation experienced at the local level and socio political transformation   led to changes of local groundwater policies. a positive impact of these changes is expected, but not yet visible. the studied policies consider the complexity of groundwater functions and the different users depending on them. however, they do not explicitly mention ecosystem services and ignore important ecological processes and functions. therefore, we conclude that groundwater management could become more sustainable by taking ecosystem services and stakeholder interests more explicitly into account in local policy processes. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd and erp environment",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0
Foglia et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,coupling a spatiotemporally distributed soil waterbudget with stream depletion functions to inform stakeholder driven management of groundwater dependent ecosystems,"groundwater pumping, even if only seasonal, may significantly impact groundwater dependent ecosystems through increased streamflow depletion, particularly in semiarid and arid regions. the effects are exacerbated, under some conditions, by climate change. in social sciences, the management of groundwater dependent ecosystems is generally considered a wicked problem due to the complexity of affected stakeholder groups, disconnected legal frameworks, and a divergence of policies and science at the cross road between groundwater and surfacewater, and between ecosystems and water quality. a range of often simplified scientific tools plays an important role in addressing such problems. here we develop a spatiotemporally distributed soil waterbudget model that we couple with an analytical model for stream depletion from groundwater pumping to rapidly assess seasonal impacts of groundwater pumping on streamflow during critical low flow periods. we demonstrate the applicability of the tool for the scott valley in northern california, where protected salmon depend on summer streamflow fed by cool groundwater. in this example, simulations suggest that increased recharge in the period immediately preceding the critical low streamflow season, and transfer of groundwater pumping away from the stream are potentially promising tools to address ecosystem concerns, albeit raising difficult infrastructure and water trading issues. in contrast, additional winter recharge at the expense of later spring recharge, whether intentional or driven by climate may reduce summer streamflows. comparison to existing detailed numerical groundwater model results suggests that the coupled soil water mass balancestream depletion function approach provides a viable tool for scenario development among stakeholders, to constructively inform the search for potential solutions, and to direct more detailed, complex site specific feasibility studies. the tool also identifies important field monitoring efforts needed to improve the understanding and quantification of site specific groundwater stream interactions.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0
Knuppe et al.,2011,Water Sa,the challenges facing sustainable and adaptive groundwater management in south africa,"long term population growth and economic development are placing ever increasing pressure on south africa's freshwater supply. on the basis of the current climate change predictions, which often entail uncertain consequences for aquifer systems and the associated groundwater goods and services, it is expected that the stress on water will increase even further. currently, south africa's groundwater governance regime does not provide the capacity to assure effective and sustainable resource regulation and allocation. to date, the management of groundwater is hampered by a variety of uncertainties, such as global climate change and socio economic growth, as well as ineffective governance structures affecting resource use, regulation, protection and the implementation of alternative strategies needed to achieve sustainable management. this paper presents the results of a qualitative assessment of interviews conducted with experts in south africa. four key challenges are identified to the development of adaptive and sustainable groundwater management and the successful implementation of current water legislation in south africa. these are: the undervaluation of groundwater importance and significance; the need for expertise and information at all scales; the centralisation of power; and the disregard of ecosystems and the associated goods and services. as a means to tackle these challenges, it has been assumed that the concept of adaptive water management represents a suitable approach to governing groundwater resources, by taking into account complex system linkages between hydrogeological, political, socio economic and environmental domains. supporting principles, such as tools for cooperation, participation and information networks, have been developed to facilitate the implementation of adaptive water management approaches and hence to achieve institutional change in the political arena of groundwater management.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
Knuppe et al.,2011,Water Resources Management,a framework for the analysis of governance structures applying to groundwater resources and the requirements for the sustainable management of associated ecosystem services,"the competing demands placed on groundwater for socio economic and for ecological benefits, and the resultant tradeoffs, represent a major challenge for the management arena. the governance of groundwater resources and the sustainable management of associated ecosystem services must take into consideration human and biophysical characteristics as intertwined systems. frameworks and analytical tools are required to help understand complex governance regimes, and the linkages between management and the corresponding effects on ecosystem services. presented in this paper is a framework for the analysis of groundwater governance based on the adaptivemanagement approach and the ecosystem services concept. governance can be analyzed on the basis of certain characteristics. one characteristic of a governance regime assumed to be crucial for adaptive and sustainable management is vertical integration, which refers to the connectedness of different administrative levels, including the involvement of non governmental stakeholders in decision making and planning processes. the framework was applied in the upper guadiana basin in spain, where the intensive use of groundwater has led to significant conflicts between farmers, authorities and environmental conservation groups. the analysis showed that conflicts arose from a lack of vertical integration; e.g., one way communication between official authorities and the exclusion of local stakeholders during planning processes. the framework is deemed to be a strong analytical tool as it provides a basis for organized and context specific case study assessment and renders complex groundwater management more transparent and comprehensible. the framework will be further applied and enhanced for application in international case studies.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0
Mukherji et al.,2005,Hydrogeology Journal,groundwater socio ecology and governance: a review of institutions and policies in selected countries,"groundwater is crucial for the livelihoods and food security of millions of people, and yet, knowledge formation in the field of groundwater has remained asymmetrical. while, scientific knowledge in the discipline (hydrology and hydrogeology) has advanced remarkably, relatively little is known about the socio economic impacts and institutions that govern groundwater use. this paper therefore has two objectives. the first is to provide a balanced view of the plus and the down side of groundwater use, especially in agriculture. in doing so, examples are drawn from countries such as india, pakistan, bangladesh, china, spain and mexico all of which make very intensive use of groundwater. second, institutions and policies that influence groundwater use are analyzed in order to understand how groundwater is governed in these countries and whether successful models of governance could be replicated elsewhere. finally, the authors argue that there is a need for a paradigm shift in the way groundwater is presently perceived and managed from management to governance mode. in this attempt, a number of instruments such as direct regulation, indirect policy levers, livelihood adaptation and people's participation will have to be deployed simultaneously in a quest for better governance.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0
Custodio et al.,2002,Hydrogeology Journal,aquifer overexploitation: what does it mean?,"groundwater overexploitation and aquifer overexploitation are terms that are becoming common in water re sources management. hydrologists. managers and journalists use them when talking about stressed aquifers or some groundwater conflict. overexploitation may be defined as the situation in which, for sonic years, average aquifer abstraction rate is, greater than. or close to the average recharge rate. but rate and extent of recharge areas are often very uncertain. besides, they may be modified by human activities and aquifer development. in practice, however, an aquifer is often considered as overexploited when some persistent negative results of aquifer development are felt or perceived. such as a continuous water level drawdown. progressive water quality deterioration, increase of abstraction cost. or ecological damage. but negative results do not necessarily imply that abstraction is greater than recharge. they may be simply due to well interferences and the long transient period that follow changes in the aquifer waterbalance. groundwater storage is depleted to some extent during the transient period after abstraction is increased. its duration depends on aquifer size. specific storage and permeability. which level of ""aquifer overexploitation"" is advisable or bearable. depends oil the detailed and updated consideration of aquifer development effects and the measures implemented for correction. this should not be the result of applying general rules based on sonic indirect data. monitoring. sound aquifer knowledge, and calculation or modelling, of behaviour are needed in the framework of a set of objectives and policies. they should be established by a management institution, with the involvement of groundwater stakeholders, and take into account the environmental and,octal constraints. aquifer overexploitation. which often is perceived to be associated with something ethically bad, is not necessarily detrimental if it is not permanent. it may be a,step towards sustainable development. actually, the term aquifer overexploitation is mostly a qualifier that intends to point to a concern about the evolution of the aquifer flow system in some specific, restricted points of view, but without a precise hydrodynamic meaning. implementing, groundwater management and protection meat sures needs quantitative appraisal of aquifer evolution and effects based on detailed multidisciplinary studies. which have to he supported by reliable data.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
