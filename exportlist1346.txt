AB  - The study investigates the spatial and temporal variation of groundwater table within municipal precincts of Rawalpindi metropolitan city. The research was based on current and historic withdrawals as a primary source of drinking water supply. A geodatabase of 278 tube wells with three distinct timelines of recorded subsurface water levels was developed. Vertical sections were extracted from the interpolated surfaces and reconciled to a common x, y reference to isolate spatial and temporal trend of water table. Over exploitation of groundwater is leading to progressive depletion of the groundwater resource. The decline in groundwater level was observed to be steep in areas farthest from the potential recharge zones, a phenomenon that is also coincident with the density of the installed wells. Gradual cessation of pumpage within the metropolitan area and artificial means of replenishing the groundwater aquifer are recommended.

AB  - Intrusion of seawater into coastal aquifers is considered one of the most important processes that degrade water-quality by raising the salinity to levels exceeding acceptable drinking standards. Therefore saltwater intrusion should be prevented or at least controlled to protect groundwater resources. This paper presents a cost-effective method to control seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. This methodology ADR (Abstraction, Desalination and Recharge) includes; abstraction of saline water and recharge to the aquifer after desalination. A coupled transient density-dependent finite element model is developed for simulation of fluid flow and solute transport and used to simulate seawater intrusion. The simulation model has been integrated with an optimization model to examine three scenarios to control seawater intrusion including; abstraction, recharge and a combination system, ADR. The main objectives of the models are to determine the optimal depths, locations and abstraction/recharge rates for the wells to minimize the total costs for construction and operation as well as salt concentrations in the aquifer. A comparison between the combined system (ADR) and the individual abstraction or recharge system is made in terms of total cost and total salt concentration in the aquifer and the amount of repulsion of seawater achieved. The results show that the proposed ADR system performs significantly better than using abstraction or recharge wells alone as it gives the least cost and least salt concentration in the aquifer. ADR is considered an effective tool to control seawater intrusion and can be applied in areas where there is a risk of seawater intrusion.

AB  - It is common to define drainage as a means to enhance crop production and increase productivity. In order to meet this objective, drainage systems are designed and managed to maintain favourable moisture and salt conditions in the root zone. Examples from around the world show that drainage has done well to achieve this objective. However, lessons show that many impacts of drainage, positive and negative, have been overlooked, including those on health, built-up settlements and infrastructure, flood management, groundwater recharge, sanitation, surface and groundwater quality, fisheries and aquatic life, and the environment in general. Thus, the single-objective approach takes drainage out of the broader context of land and water management and diminishes the overall gains of improved drainage and ignores its full cost. It does also not allow the stakeholders from outside the farming community to be involved in the decision-making leading to conflict of interests. It also misses an important opportunity for increasing the financing potential. A better understanding of drainage as a practice for managing the multiple functions of land and water resources is needed in order to achieve an optimal mix of economic and social gains, sustainable natural resources management and a healthy environment. This would only be possible when an interdisciplinary and integrated approach is followed in planning and managing land drainage. The approach, called DRAINFRAME, is a framework for analysis, communication, discussion, and decision-making by all stakeholders. It looks at the overall social, economic, and environmental productivity of the entire water management system, of which drainage is an integral part. It allows comprehensive analysis and assessment of basin-wide social and economic impacts of drainage following a participatory planning approach. Although the methodology was developed from a drainage perspective, it is geared towards natural resources management planning in general. It can be equally used in planning irrigation, flood control or watershed management projects. The DRAINFRAME approach was applied in planning some new World Bank-supported projects in Egypt and Pakistan with the objective of promoting the concept of integrated water resources management.

AB  - The increasing gap between the supply and demand for water in the Economic and Social Commission of Western Asia (ESCWA) member countries: Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen) can be attributed to the limited availability of surface water mining of fossil groundwater sources, and water pollution mainly of shallow aquifers, deficient institutional structure, poor management processes, and inapt allocation of financial resources. The non-sustainable use of natural water resources to meet the escalating water demand has also contributed to the depletion and deterioration of water quality and quantity. To meet water supply shortages in the domestic sector, water desalination has been entrenched as a viable option for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes the following countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. The objective of the paper is to investigate the role of water desalination in meeting the water demands in the ESCWA member countries. The significant role of desalination is highlighted with emphasis in evaluating not only its production trends, processes, and costs, but also its capacity in the provision of water demands. Water desalination has become a major and staunch water source for a number of large urban centers. For such countries such as Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar and the coastal zone areas of Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), If and Saudi Arabia, desalination represents one of the most feasible and strategic alternative options for their current and future domestic water supply requirement. Given the high consumption rate from this source and its high production cost, fundamental efforts must be integrated and invested in both research and development programs to implement comprehensive conservation measures that would lead to a reduction in the consumption rates. Parallel to these achievements, efforts should be directed within the context of integrated management of water resources, to identify alternative potential water resources, to meet future water challenges.

AB  - The storage of groundwater in the Nile Basin has been assessed in order to inform its potential role in community development and sustainable growth in the basin, where hydropolitics is critical among upstream and downstream countries. It is a well-known fact that water management activities in the basin focus on the surface water resources, with less or no attention to the groundwater, while the majority of urban and rural communities rely on groundwater for day-to-day activities. The results show that downstream countries (Egypt and Sudan) have considerable groundwater storage as a result of favourable geological formations (sedimentary rocks), while upstream countries (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi and Rwanda) are underlain by crystalline basement and volcanic rocks with low groundwater productivity. The available groundwater in the shallow and deep (transboundary) aquifers requires holistic development and management by stakeholders across the borders in order to sustainably adapt to changing climate in the basin and shift the dependence pattern on the Nile River for water supply.

AB  - In this paper, the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater depth and groundwater salinity associated with agricultural activities and land cover and land use (LCLU) in the Keriya Oasis, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, was investigated. A decision tree classification was developed for LCLU mapping by using Landsat 8 imagery. Radial basis function, Pearson's correlation coefficient, Moran's I statistics and geographically weighted regression were employed to identify the spatial and temporal relationship between topsoil salinity and LCLU types. The results showed that groundwater depth in about 75 % of the study area was less than 3.0 m. Groundwater salinity showed an increasing trend with decreasing groundwater depth. A relatively higher positive correlation (r = 0.87) was found between groundwater salinity and topsoil salinity. Topsoil salinity was exacerbated by agricultural activities at the upstream of seasonal rivers, causing severe soil salinization and soil degradation in the downstream. Both groundwater depth and soil salinity showed seasonal fluctuations with the shallowest groundwater level occurring in spring, while during summer and autumn, groundwater depth increased due to the extensive of agricultural water consumption and the regional evapotranspiration, which was followed by a winter recharge; non-saline groundwater region was 21 % of the research area in spring, which dropped to 1.1, 1.0 and 1.2 %, respectively, during the summer, autumn and winter. The results also demonstrated that shallow groundwater depth of 2.5 m is the critical depth value for soil salinization in the Keriya Oasis.

AB  - Since groundwater is an integral component of natural hydrologic systems, an estimation of groundwater recharge is required to understand the changes in the temporal water budget and groundwater flow system. The rate of groundwater recharge varies widely in space and time particularly in arid to semiarid regions, and it is rather difficult to measure recharge directly. The aim of this study was to assess the natural groundwater recharge in Al Zerba catchment and the interaction between the surface and groundwater. The catchment is classified as an arid to semiarid climate with an aridity index of 0.25 to 0.3 and long-term average annual precipitation ranging from 300 to 350 mm. Delineation of the catchment boundary was carried out using spatial interpolation of elevation data extracted from the digital elevation model. The effects of vegetation and abstraction from pumping wells on the groundwater table were investigated. Furthermore, groundwater recharge was estimated based on water budget, water table fluctuation analysis by using rainfall infiltration breakthrough, and soil water balance using hydrologic evaluation of landfill performance model (HELP3). The results show that groundwater pumping leads negative impact to long-term decrease in groundwater levels, particularly in the dry season, while no significant effects of vegetation on groundwater were observed. Moreover, the result showed an average annual groundwater recharge ranging from 20 to 35 mm/a (about 10 to 15 % of the precipitation period 2001-2010), concentrated in the north and southwestern regions (outcrops of permeable/coarse-grained limestone and a major fault zone).

AB  - The management of water resources requires an adequate understanding of the relationship between the various components of the hydrological cycle. The accelerated urbanization and agricultural development impose the concern about the sustainability of water resources, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. In such environments, water scarcity and drought often lead to intensive groundwater abstraction which can adversely affect the hydrological system. Severe over-exploitation of groundwater has been observed on the Aleppo basin of the Al Qweek River. The Al Qweek valley constitutes the central part of the study area (southwestern parts of the Aleppo basin). The region is characterized by a semi-arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 325 mm. The intensive exploitation of the upper aquifer in the catchment is responsible for a continuous decline of the piezometric levels with an average of 1.8 m/year. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the upper aquifer and the Al Qweek River within the catchment boundary using streamflow and hydrograph separation techniques by means of daily discharge data for both the Al Qweek and Al Qwaak rivers. HydroOffice was used for the base-flow separation, flow duration curves (FDC), and recession curve displacement analysis. Furthermore, groundwater recharge was estimated by means of RECESS and RORA. This is the first study using the hydrograph separation method in this region to our knowledge. The results indicate a proportional relationship between the surface and groundwater with an average discharge fluctuation that ranged from 0.30 to 0.20 m for the Al Qweek and Al Qwaak rivers, respectively. The results also revealed a dominant base flow in the catchment that ranged from 86.3 to 88.2 % of the total flow with a computed base-flow index that varied from 0.85 to 0.90 in all gauge stations, indicating a stable flow regime in the region. Furthermore, the high base flow is resulting in high permeability conditions of the upper aquifer and low direct surface runoff. The visual interpretation of the FDC suggests sustained base flow from groundwater storage. The low-flow index indicates an average contribution of groundwater storage of 45 to 58 %. The result of recession curve analysis shows a recession constant from 0.8 to 0.9 indicating a dominant interflow and low overland runoff. Furthermore, the results also show that estimation of groundwater recharge using RORA is inappropriate for the region of interest.

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to hydrochemical and isotopic data of 34 groundwater samples. This allowed the reduction of 20 variables to four significant PCs that explain 81.9% of the total variance; F1 (47.1%) explains the groundwater mineralization, whereas F2 (17%) shows isotopic enrichment and nitrate pollution. Based on an iso-factor scores map of F1, three water zones were delineated: Zone A (F1 < - 1), with fresh groundwater from the unconfined aquifer; Zone B (1 > F1 > - 1), with moderate mineralization from the confined-unconfined aquifer boundary; and Zone C (F1 > 1), with the most mineralized hot water from the confined aquifer. The iso-factor scores map of F2 delineates positive values representing samples from the unconfined aquifer, with freshwater and nitrate contamination associated with stable isotope enrichment, whereas negative values represent samples from the confined aquifer. The results clearly demonstrate the usefulness of PCA in groundwater hydrochemistry investigations.

AB  - THE SUSTAINABLE irrigated agriculture in Egypt is threatened by water stress that made the reuse of wastewater an alternative option not only in the sandy desert soils but also in the alluvial soils. To assess the impacts of long-term wastewater irrigation on soil quality, soils have been irrigated with the effluents of Al-Qalyubia drain beside adjacent Nile fresh water-irrigated soils (reference), sampled and analyzed. The wastewater irrigation improved fertility status, causing significant increases (P < 0.05) in total N and AB-DTPA extractable P, Fe and Mn compared to the reference soils. However, there was a significant (P < 0.05) build-up in soil salinity and total heavy metals; Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the wastewater-irrigated soils over the reference soils. The Dutch model indicated that the Nile fresh water remained safe for agricultural production, while the wastewater-irrigated soils could be used under certain precautions. Focal measures are recommended to alleviate heavy metal contaminants to avoid potential environmental risks including mixing the wastewater with the fresh water before use and implementation of proper on-farm treatments.

AB  - Accurate and reliable groundwater level forecasting models can help ensure the sustainable use of a watershed's aquifers for urban and rural water supply. In this paper, a new method based on coupling discrete wavelet transforms (WA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) for groundwater level forecasting applications is proposed. The relative performance of the proposed coupled wavelet-neural network models (WA-ANN) was compared to regular artificial neural network (ANN) models and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for monthly groundwater level forecasting. The variables used to develop and validate the models were monthly total precipitation, average temperature and average groundwater level data recorded from November 2002 to October 2009 at two sites in the Chateauguay watershed in Quebec, Canada. The WA-ANN models were found to provide more accurate monthly average groundwater level forecasts compared to the ANN and ARIMA models. The results of the study indicate the potential of WA-ANN models in forecasting groundwater levels. It is recommended that additional studies explore this proposed method, which can be used in turn to facilitate the development and implementation of more effective and sustainable groundwater management strategies.

AB  - Daily water demand forecasts are an important component of cost-effective and sustainable management and optimization of urban water supply systems. In this study, a method based on coupling discrete wavelet transforms (WA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for urban water demand forecasting applications is proposed and tested. Multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ANN and WA-ANN models for urban water demand forecasting at lead times of one day for the summer months (May to August) were developed, and their relative performance was compared using the coefficient of determination, root mean square error, relative root mean square error, and efficiency index. The key variables used to develop and validate the models were daily total precipitation, daily maximum temperature, and daily water demand data from 2001 to 2009 in the city of Montreal, Canada. The WA-ANN models were found to provide more accurate urban water demand forecasts than the MLR, MNLR, ARIMA, and ANN models. The results of this study indicate that coupled wavelet-neural network models are a potentially promising new method of urban water demand forecasting that merit further study.

AB  - Texas High Plains (THP), one of the most important food and fiber producing regions in the Ogallala Aquifer Region, currently faces rapid decline of groundwater levels. Predicted climate extremes and high temporal variability in growing season precipitation may require growers to pump more groundwater from the Ogallala Aquifer to meet higher crop water demand. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM) is a widely used crop simulation tool for evaluating impacts of different water and crop management practices, including irrigation on crop yield and water use efficiency. In this study, CROPGRO-Cotton module of the DSSAT was calibrated and validated using 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2010 irrigated lysimeter field data managed by the USDA-ARS (United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service) Conservation and Production Research Laboratory at Bushland, TX. The lysimeter field consisted of four equal plots designated as NE, SE, NW, and SW. Crop growth characteristics including leaf area index (LAI), above ground biomass (AGB), evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, and lint yield of 2000-NE, 2000-SE, and 2001-NE, were used for calibration and 2002-NE, 2010-NE, and 2010-SE were used for validation. The calibrated and validated model was used to simulate the long term (1924-2012) crop yield and seasonal crop ET. During the calibration process, some of the cultivar and ecotype parameters that influence LAI, AGB, and lint yield were adjusted for better statistical results. Measured and simulated LAI, AGB, ET, soil moisture, and lint yield showed good agreement during calibration and validation as indicated by performance statistics such as r(2) from 0.70 to 0.82, and percent error (PE) = -0.85 to 17.3% for LAI; r(2) = 0.89 to 0.95, and PE = -7.36 to -13.66% for AGB; and r(2)=0.90 to 0.94, and PE = 3.20 to 3.44% for ET during calibration and validation, respectively. The model underestimated ET during peak vegetative growth and development stage except in some circumstances. The calibrated and validated model was able to simulate lint yield and seasonal ET during a long term (1924-2012) historic period for Bushland, TX, under irrigated conditions. The calibrated model could be used to schedule ET based irrigation management practices in the THP and to estimate future ET for other modeling experiments.

AB  - Indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals for intensive agriculture is mainly responsible for deterioration of groundwater quality in west Delhi of India. Geophysical and hydrochemical investigations were carried out to decipher subsurface geologic formation and assess groundwater salinity. Electrical resistivity tomography surveys revealed the presence of potential groundwater zones at 20-30 m below ground level. The groundwater quality was moderate to poor as evidenced from the low resistivity value of the potential aquifer. Only 20.2 % of the study area showed good quality groundwater potentiality, situated at few pockets in eastern, western, and northern parts of the study area. Low resistivity formation at southern part of the study area was due to infiltration of highly polluted drain water along with fertilizer rich surface water to the aquifer. Hydrochemical investigation also confirmed the result. The average electrical conductivity of groundwater was around 5,950 mu S cm(-1). Longitudinal unit conductance and transverse unit resistance values were calculated and used for delineation of saline groundwater zones. A direct relationship between longitudinal unit conductance and groundwater salinity made it possible to develop empirical equations by which salinity can be predicted from computed longitudinal unit conductance value. It helps for periodic monitoring of the pollution level by spending less labour and money and benefits immensely the policy makers. The article suggests further study and research work that can lead to sustainable exploitation/use and management of groundwater resources in west Delhi.

AB  - Inappropriate handling/integration of data from various sources is a problem that can make any spatial prediction tasking and inaccurate. Attempt was made in this study to offer solution to this problem by exploring the capability of GIS-based elementary MCDA as a spatial prediction tool. In order to achieve the set objectives, spatial prediction of potential zones of sustainable groundwater resources in a given study area was used as a case study. A total of five set of criteria/factors believed to be influencing groundwater storage potential in the area were selected. Each criterion/factor was assigned appropriate weight based on Saaty's 9 point scale and the weights were normalized through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The process was integrated in the GIS environment to produce the groundwater potential prediction map for the area. The effect of coherence of criteria on the efficiency of MCDA as a prediction tool was also examined. The prediction map produced was found to be 81.25% accurate. The results of the examination of the effect of coherence of criteria revealed that the ability of the method to produce accurate prediction is dependent on the exhaustiveness of the set of criteria used. It was established in the study that the GIS-based elementary MCDA technique is capable of producing accurate and reliable prediction particularly if the set of criteria use for the prediction is coherent.

AB  - Groundwater-the world's largest freshwater resource-is critically important for irrigated agriculture and hence for global food security. Yet depletion is widespread in large groundwater systems in both semi-arid and humid regions of the world. Excessive extraction for irrigation where groundwater is slowly renewed is the main cause of the depletion, and climate change has the potential to exacerbate the problem in some regions. Globally aggregated groundwater depletion contributes to sea-level rise, and has accelerated markedly since the mid-twentieth century. But its impacts on water resources are more obvious at the regional scale, for example in agriculturally important parts of India, China and the United States. Food production in such regions can only be made sustainable in the long term if groundwater levels are stabilized. To this end, a transformation is required in how we value, manage and characterize groundwater systems. Technical approaches-such as water diversion, artificial groundwater recharge and efficient irrigation-have failed to balance regional groundwater budgets. They need to be complemented by more comprehensive strategies that are adapted to the specific social, economic, political and environmental settings of each region.

AB  - A multidisciplinary approach was developed to estimate urban groundwater vulnerability to contamination combining hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry, subterranean hydrogeotechnics, groundwater ecotoxicology and isotope tracers. Paranhos and Salgueiros spring waters in Porto City were used as a case study. Historical and current vulnerability scenarios were compared using hydrogeological GIS-based modelling. Potential contamination sources were mapped around the spring galleries. Most of these were point sources and their potential contamination load was moderate. The ecotoxicological assessment indicated a low acute toxicity potential. Groundwater radionuclides appeared to be mainly controlled by geological factors and biomineralisation. Vulnerability maps suggest that most of the area has a moderate to low vulnerability to contamination. However, some surface sources such as sewage systems cause contamination and contribute to increased vulnerability. This integrated approach was demonstrated to be adequate for a better knowledge of urban hydrogeological processes and their dynamics, and highlighted the importance of a vulnerability assessment in urban areas.

AB  - Sustainable development and the management of groundwater resources for optimal socio-economic development constitutes one of the most effective strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change in rural areas where poverty is a critical cause of environmental damage. This research assessed groundwater recharge and its spatial and temporal variations in Gushiegu District in the Northern Region of Ghana, where groundwater is the main source of water supply for most uses. Isotopic data of precipitation and groundwater were used to infer the origin of groundwater and the possible relationship between groundwater and surface water in the partially metamorphosed sedimentary aquifer system in the study area. Though the data do not significantly establish strong relation between groundwater and surface water, the study suggests that groundwater in the area is of meteoric origin. However, the data also indicate significant enrichment of the heavy isotopes (O-18 and H-2) in groundwater relative to rainwater in the area. The Chloride Mass Balance (CMB) and Water Table Fluctuations (WTF) techniques were used to quantitatively estimate the groundwater recharge in the area. The results suggest groundwater recharge in a range of 13.9 mm/y - 218 mm/y, with an average of 89 mm/yr, representing about 1.4%-21.8% (average 8.9%) of the annual precipitation in the area. There is no clearly defined trend in the temporal variations of groundwater recharge in the area, but the spatial variations are discussed in relation to the underlying lithologies. The results suggest that the fraction of precipitation that reaches the saturated zone as groundwater recharge is largely controlled by the vertical hydraulic conductivities of the material of the unsaturated zone. The vertical hydraulic conductivity coupled with humidity variations in the area modulates the vertical infiltration and percolation of precipitation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater resources of Sohag, Egypt are currently threatened by contamination from agricultural and urbanization activities. Groundwater in Sohag area has a special significance where it is the second source for fresh water used for agricultural, domestic, and industrial purposes. Due to growing population, agriculture expansion, and urbanization, groundwater quality assessment needs more attention to cope with the increasing water demand in this arid zones and limited water resources. The aim of this paper is to address the integrated role of geochemical processes, agriculture and urbanization in evolution of groundwater composition, and their impact on groundwater quality to help in management and protection of groundwater resources of study area using geochemical modeling techniques and geographical information systems. Spatial variation of groundwater hydrochemical properties, rock-water interaction, ion exchange, and assessment of groundwater quality were investigated. Results indicated that groundwater properties are varied spatially and its evolution in the study area is generally controlled by the prevailed geochemical processes represented by leaching, dissolution, and precipitation of salts and minerals, ion exchange, in addition to human activities represented by agriculture and urbanization as well as climatic and poor drainage conditions. Management alternatives should be followed in the study area to avoid degradation of groundwater quality and provide sustainable development.

AB  - Wadi Feiran basin is one of the most promising areas in southern Sinai (Egypt) for establishing new communities and for growth in agriculture, tourism, and industry. The present challenges against development include water runoff hazards (flash flooding), the increasing water demand, and water scarcity and contamination. These challenges could be mitigated by efficient use of runoff and rainwater through appropriate management, thereby promoting sustainable development. Strategies include the mitigation of runoff hazards and promoting the natural and artificial recharge of aquifers. This study uses a watershed modeling system, geographic information system, and classification scheme to predict the effects of various mitigation options on the basin's water resources. Rainwater-harvesting techniques could save more than 77% of the basin's runoff (by volume), which could be used for storage and aquifer recharge. A guide map is provided that shows possible locations for the proposed mitigation options in the study basin. Appropriate measures should be undertaken urgently: mitigation of groundwater contamination (including effective sewage effluent management); regular monitoring of the municipal, industrial and agricultural processes that release contaminants; rationalization and regulation of the application of agro-chemicals to farmland; and regular monitoring of contaminants in groundwater. Stringent regulations should be implemented to prevent wastewater disposal to the aquifers in the study area.

AB  - The chemical characteristics of water in the Oratunga Area, Central Flinders Ranges, South Australia have been used to evaluate and determine the processes controlling water chemistry in addition to the sources of ions. The isotopic analysis results show that the groundwater is mainly meteoric. Based on the rock and water chemistry, ionic ratios, hydrochemical facies and saturation indices, the chemical evolution has been studied. The chemistry of groundwater revealed two types of water. Thus, in high topographic areas, low TDS, bicarbonate and mixed water types are dominated and support a rapid and direct recharge. While in the low topographic areas, high TDS and chloride compositions are the most common attributed to the accumulation of ions and groundwater evolution. Analysis of the ion concentration, head data and saturation indices shows a compositional trend that can be studied as an evolutionary system. The ionic ratios and hydrogeochemical modelling using NETPATH was used to quantify and verify the different hydrochemical processes. The resulting data shows that calcite dissolution/precipitation and cation exchange reactions are the major processes affecting groundwater chemical evolution of the groundwater in the basin. This study has provided a basis for a better understanding of the hydrogeologic setting in areas of a little data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Egypt is currently seeking additional freshwater resources to support national reclamation projects based mainly on the Nubian aquifer groundwater resources. In this study, temporal (April 2002 to June 2016) Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived terrestrial water storage (TWSGRACE) along with other relevant datasets was used to monitor and quantify modern recharge and depletion rates of the Nubian aquifer in Egypt (NAE) and investigate the interaction of the NAE with artificial lakes. Results indicate: (1) the NAE is receiving a total recharge of 20.27 +/- 1.95 km(3) during 4/2002-2/2006 and 4/2008-6/2016 periods, (2) recharge events occur only under excessive precipitation conditions over the Nubian recharge domains and/or under a significant rise in Lake Nasser levels, (3) the NAE is witnessing a groundwater depletion of - 13.45 +/- 0.82 km(3)/year during 3/2006-3/2008 period, (4) the observed groundwater depletion is largely related to exceptional drought conditions and/or normal baseflow recession, and (5) a conjunctive surface water and groundwater management plan needs to be adapted to develop sustainable water resources management in the NAE. Findings demonstrate the use of global monthly TWSGRACE solutions as a practical, informative, and cost-effective approach for monitoring aquifer systems across the globe.

AB  - Groundwater has been identified as one of the major freshwater sources that can potentially meet the growing demands of Egypt's population. Gravity data (from 381 ground gravity stations) were collected, processed, and analyzed together with the available aeromagnetic (800 line-km) data to investigate the hydrogeologic and structural settings, areal distribution, geometry, and water storage of the aquifers in El Qaa coastal plain in the southwest Sinai Peninsula, and to assess their longevity given projected extraction rates. Findings include (1) complete Bouguer anomaly and total magnetic intensity maps show two connected sub-basins separated by a narrow saddle with an average basin length of 43 km and an average width of 12 km; (2) two-dimensional modeling of both gravity and magnetic data indicates basin fill with a maximum thickness of 3.5 km; (3) using anomalous residual gravity, the volume of water in storage was estimated at 40-56 km(3); and (4) progressive increases in extraction rates over time will deplete up to 40 % of the aquifers' volume in 200-230 years and will cause the water quality to deteriorate due to seawater intrusion in 45 years. Similar geophysical exploration campaigns, if conducted over the entire coastal plains of the Red Sea and the Gulfs of Suez and Aqaba, could assist in the development of sound and sustainable management schemes for the freshwater resources in these areas. The adopted techniques could pave the way toward the establishment of sustainable utilization schemes for a much larger suite of similar aquifers worldwide.

AB  - Frequency analysis of streamflow provides an essential ingredient in our understanding of hydrologic events and provides needed guidance in the design and management of water resources infrastructure. However, traditional hydrologic approaches often fail to include important external effects that can result in unpredictable or unforeseen changes in streamflow. Moreover, previous studies investigating multiple characteristics of streamflow do not address a nonstationary approach. This study explores nonstationary frequency analysis of bivariate characteristics, including occurrence and severity, of annual low flow in the Connecticut River Basin, United States. To investigate bivariate low flow frequency, copulas and their marginal distributions are constructed by using stationary and nonstationary approaches. Our study results indicate that streamflow used in this study demonstrate significant nonstationarity. Over time, the occurrence and severity of low flows are shown to be lower with the same probability based on the results of nonstationary copulas. Bivariate low flow frequencies in the years 1970, 2000, and 2030, and their joint return periods are estimated under the nonstationary copulas. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the coupled effects of weather condition, crop coverage change, and regional water management (i.e., releases from Caballo Reservoir) on hydrologic characteristics of Rincon Valley (2466 km(2)), a semi-arid agricultural area in New Mexico, U.S.A., using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The model simulates the vertical water budget and horizontal water transfers during the period 1994-2013, incorporating irrigation of fourteen crops in normal (2008) and dry (2011) years to evaluate the hydrologic impacts of cropping change as a drought-adaptive water management strategy. It was calibrated (2000-2002) and validated (2003-2005) using daily-observed streamflow data. Furthermore, evapotranspiration, diversion and irrigation water volume were verified for the period of 2000-2005 using monthly crop irrigation requirement data and canal discharge data. Results demonstrate the significant role of surface water infiltration, providing approximately 18% of the average annual groundwater recharge during the irrigation season. Watershed scale evapotranspiration (ET) and return flows for the irrigation season were estimated to be 23% and 1% higher than those for the non-irrigation season, respectively. For irrigation units, the ratio of ET to combined precipitation and irrigation water for the dry year was 5% higher than the normal year whereas surface runoff, soil water storage, and groundwater recharge were 7%, 17%, and 39% lower than the normal year, respectively. High groundwater recharge occurs in the hydrologic response units (HRU) where corn and cotton are planted on silty clay loam soil. The Alfalfa acreage (i.e., the largest water user) was reduced by 15% while the cotton acreage was increased by 13% in order to adapt to lower water availability during the dry year. Quantitative understanding of the hydrologic fluxes in the Rincon Valley's irrigated agricultural area illuminates adaptive land and water management to buffer the adverse impacts of prolonged droughts.

AB  - Understanding the characteristics of groundwater occurrence in Jeju Island is crucial in managing groundwater resources which is dominant water resources in the island. This study suggests a hydrogeological model for this volcanic island named as 'multi-shingle model', which emphasizes the role of impermeable clay sediment layers on the groundwater occurrence, based on the field observations and previous findings from literature reviews. The model can explain the characteristics of groundwater occurrence in Jeju Island such as vertical discontinuity of groundwater level, heterogeniety of groundwater age, areal distribution and fluctuation patterns of groundwater level and hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater, which are not fully explained by the conventional model in the previous studies.

AB  - Groundwater and surface water interactions within riparian corridors impact the distribution of phreatophytes that tap into groundwater stores. The changes in canopy area of phreatophytes over time is related to changes in depth to groundwater, distance from a stream or river, and hydrologic soil group. Remote sensing was used to determine the location of trees with pre-development and post-development aerial photography over the Ogallala Aquifer in the central plains of the United States. It was found that once the depth to groundwater becomes greater than about 3 m, tree populations decrease as depth to water increases. This subsequently limited the extent of phreatophytes to within 700 m of the river. It was also found that phreatophytes have a higher likelihood of growing on hydrologic soil groups with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. Phreatophytes exist along portions of the Arkansas River corridor where significant decreases in groundwater occurred as long as alluvium exists to create perched conditions where trees survive dry periods. Significant decreases (more that 50%) in canopy cover exists along river segments where groundwater declined by more than 10 m, indicating areas with good hydraulic connectivity between surface water and groundwater. Thus, interpretation of changes in phreatophyte distribution using historical and recent aerial photography is important in delineating zones of enhanced recharge where aquifers might be effectively recharged through diversion of surface water runoff.

AB  - Human 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF) negatively regulate transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in vitro. However, the physiological roles of this negative regulation are not well understood. Here, by using a number of approaches to identify protein-DNA interactions in vivo, we show that DSIF- and NELF-mediated transcriptional pausing has a dual function in regulating immediate-early expression of the human junB gene. Before induction by interleukin-6, RNAPII, DSIF, and NELF accumulate in the promoter-proximal region of junB, mainly at around position +50 from the transcription initiation site. After induction, the association of these proteins with the promoter-proximal region continues whereas RNAPII and DSIF are also found in the downstream regions. Depletion of a subunit of NELF by RNA interference enhances the junB mRNA level both before and after induction, indicating that DSIF- and NELF-mediated pausing contributes to the negative regulation of junB expression, not only by inducing RNAPII pausing before induction but also by attenuating transcription after induction. These regulatory mechanisms appear to be conserved in other immediate-early genes as well.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the groundwater-withdrawal potential of the Fraser River watershed, a mountainous drainage system in north-central Colorado. Laboratory tests, field investigations, and numerical modeling are conducted to present a quantitative understanding of the watershed's groundwater-flow system. Aquifer hydraulic conductivity values obtained from aquifer tests range from 1E-5 to 1E-3 m/s. Groundwater withdrawal is concentrated in channel-fill deposits of the Troublesome Formation within the Fraser basin. A steady state groundwater-flow model of the Fraser River watershed is developed and calibrated using 24 observation wells in the Fraser River valley and estimated baseflow of the Fraser River. Modeling results suggest that surface recharge is the major source of groundwater in the watershed. Groundwater exits the watershed through evapotranspiration and discharge to rivers. Transient groundwater-flow modeling evaluates future withdrawal scenarios using the hydraulic head distribution from the steady state model as the initial condition. Drawdown within Troublesome Formation aquifers from the current pumping schedule approaches 2 m. When the daily pumping rate is doubled, drawdown approaches 4 m. The radius of influence is hundreds of meters to 1 km. Pumping wells withdraw approximately 2 and 15 % of groundwater flowing through the well field for hydraulic conductivity of 1E-3 and 1E-5 m/s, respectively. This study suggests that the groundwater system at the Fraser Valley could sustain current and future withdrawals, given that the current recharge condition is maintained.

AB  - The impact of water policy on conserving the Ogallala Aquifer in Groundwater Management District 3 (GMD3) in southwestern Kansas is analyzed using a system-level theoretical approach integrating agricultural water and land use patterns, changing climate, economic trends, and population dynamics. In so doing, we (1) model the current hyper-extractive coupled natural-human (CNH) system, (2) forecast outcomes of policy scenarios transitioning the current groundwater-based economic system toward more sustainable paths for the social, economic, and natural components of the integrated system, and (3) develop public policy options for enhanced conservation while minimizing the economic costs for the region's communities. The findings corroborate previous studies showing that conservation often leads initially to an expansion of irrigation activities. However, we also find that the expanded presence of irrigated acreage reduces the impact of an increasingly drier climate on the region's economy and creates greater long-term stability in the farming sector along with increased employment and population in the region. On the negative side, conservation lowers the net present value of farmers' current investments and there is not a policy scenario that achieves a truly sustainable solution as defined by Peter H. Gleick. This study reinforces the salience of interdisciplinary linked CNH models to provide policy prescriptions to untangle and address significant environmental policy issues.

AB  - The Sandikli (Afyonkarahisar) Basin is located in the southwest of Turkey and is a semi-closed basin. Groundwater is widely used for drinking, domestic and irrigation purposes in the basin. The mismanagement of groundwater resources in the basin causes negative effects including depletion of the aquifer storage and groundwater level decline. To assure sustainability of the basin, determination of groundwater budget is necessary. In this study, the water-table fluctuation (WTF) and the meteorological water budget (MWB) methods were used to estimate groundwater budget in the SandA +/- klA +/- basin (Turkey). Conceptual hydrogeological model of the basin was used for understanding the relation between budget parameters. The groundwater potential of the basin calculated with MWB method as 42.10 x 10(6) m(3)/year. In addition, it is also calculated with simplified WTF method as 38.48 x 10(6) m(3)/year.

AB  - An important challenge facing the design of sustainable aquifer management plans is weak primary data on aquifer recharge and use patterns. Weak data limit the ability of policy makers to design efficient aquifer protection plans. The objectives of this article are (1) to estimate groundwater use patterns for an important food-producing region of southern Iraq, the Bahr Al-Najaf Basin; (2) to compare groundwater use patterns with the renewable groundwater supply; and (3) to describe a sustainable groundwater policy alternative to current use patterns. For this study, original data on groundwater pumping were secured for 2006-2011. The data show a pattern of unsustainable groundwater withdrawals. A policy intervention is described in which pumping permits could be assigned to groundwater users to promote sustainable use. Allowing or encouraging the permits to be transferable through trading to higher-valued uses could reduce the economic costs of protecting the aquifer while promoting its sustainable use.

AB  - Using MODFLOW 2005, this study numerically evaluated the effects of managed aquifer recharge ( MAR) using treated wastewater ( TWW) in managing the Al-Khawd coastal aquifer northeast of Oman. Our primary objective is to increase the urban water supply and to sustain the aquifer service with the lowest possible damage to the aquifer. A number of managerial scenarios were simulated and progressively developed to reduce seawater intrusion and outflow of the groundwater to the sea. An economic analysis was conducted to characterize the trade-off between the benefits of MAR and seawater inflow to the aquifer under increased abstraction for domestic supply. The results show that by managing irrigation wells and relocating public wells in conjunction with MAR practices, the abstracted volume for drinking purposes could be doubled. Even though injection of TWW is more expensive ( due to the injection cost), it was observed to result in greater benefits. The results indicate that managing the aquifer would produce a net benefit ranging from $8.22 million ( scenario 7) to $15.21 million ( scenario 4) compared to $1.57 million with the current practice. In conclusion, MAR using TWW is a feasible solution to develop water resources in arid regions, and the best scenario depends on the decision maker's preference when weighing the benefits of MAR and the level of damage to the aquifer. MAR could help manage stressed aquifer systems in arid zones to maximize the benefit of using the water for domestic purposes while minimizing the damage to the aquifer.

AB  - Climate change and land use are rapidly changing the amount and temporal distribution of recharge in northern aquifers. This paper presents a novel method for distributing Monte Carlo simulations of 1-D sandy sediment profile spatially to estimate transient recharge in an unconfined esker aquifer. The modelling approach uses data-based estimates for the most important parameters controlling the total amount (canopy cover) and timing (thickness of the unsaturated zone) of groundwater recharge. Scots pine canopy was parameterized to leaf area index (LAI) using forestry inventory data. Uncertainty in the parameters controlling sediment hydraulic properties and evapotranspiration (ET) was carried over from the Monte Carlo runs to the final recharge estimates. Different mechanisms for lake, soil, and snow evaporation and transpiration were used in the model set-up. Finally, the model output was validated with independent recharge estimates using the water table fluctuation (WTF) method and baseflow estimation. The results indicated that LAI is important in controlling total recharge amount. Soil evaporation (SE) compensated for transpiration for areas with low LAI values, which may be significant in optimal management of forestry and recharge. Different forest management scenarios tested with the model showed differences in annual recharge of up to 100 mm. The uncertainty in recharge estimates arising from the simulation parameters was lower than the interannual variation caused by climate conditions. It proved important to take unsaturated thickness and vegetation cover into account when estimating spatially and temporally distributed recharge in sandy unconfined aquifers.

AB  - The coastal Chaouia, located on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, comports three aquifers: a first Plio-quaternary constitutes the cover, a second Cretaceous located at SW in the zone of Azemmour-Tnine Chtouka, and a third Primary located at SE in the zone of Tnine Chtouka-Casablanca. These reservoirs constitute the only exploitable water resource for the social and economic development of the region between Azemmour and Casablanca. These aquifers are unconfined, pellicular, and discontinuous. They feed by infiltration of rainwater and discharge at sea. Agricultural irrigation is carried out exclusively from the groundwater, which causes a drop of the piezometric surface and the intrusion of saltwater into the aquifer at the coast. The consequence is the abandonment of some wells contaminated by seawater leading to conflict situations and significant economic losses. Therefore, delineation of the freshwater/saltwater interface is very important in order to build a sustainable groundwater management system and to implement appropriate regulatory policies. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent and the geometric characteristics of the saltwater contamination extent in the coastal aquifers of the coastal Chaouia. To achieve this, 399 vertical electric soundings and 48 electrical resistivity tomography profiles were performed perpendicular to the ocean. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity and the piezometry were measured in 344 wells distributed over the study area. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of electrical methods for mapping seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. In fact, the results of the interpretation of the VES and ERTs after calibration with the lithological data of the boreholes, as well as the values of the electrical conductivity, have shown that the length of the saltwater wedge penetration inland depends on the lithological nature of the aquifer formations. Thus, in the zone of Azemmour - Tnine Chtouka, characterized by the presence of Cretaceous terrains, the extension of the saltwater wedge exceeds 2 km towards the continent and its depth reaches 45 m. On the other hand, in the zone of Tnine Chtouka- Casablanca, characterized by the rise of the schists surmounted by the altered schists the seawater intrusion remains limited at 700 m from the coast and at 20 m of depth.

AB  - In the lower River Murray in Australia, a combination of a reduction in the frequency, duration and magnitude of natural floods, rising saline water tables in floodplains, and excessive evapotranspiration have led to an irrigation-induced groundwater mound forcing the naturally saline groundwater onto the floodplain. It is during the attenuation phase of floods that these large salt accumulations are likely to be mobilised and discharged into the river. This has been highlighted as the most significant risk in the Murray-Darling Basin and the South Australian Government and catchment management authorities have subsequently developed salt interception schemes (SIS). The aim of these schemes is to reduce the hydraulic gradient that drives the regional saline groundwater towards the River Murray. This paper investigates the interactions between a river (River Murray in South Australia) and a saline semi-arid floodplain (Clark's floodplain) that is significantly influenced by groundwater lowering due to a particular SIS. The results confirm that groundwater extraction maintains a lower water table and a higher amount of fresh river water flux to the saline floodplain aquifer. In terms of salinity, this may lead to less solute stored in the floodplain aquifer. This occurs through three mechanisms, namely extraction of the solute mass from the system, reducing the saline groundwater flux from the highland to the floodplain and changing the floodplain groundwater regime from a losing to a gaining one. It is shown that groundwater extraction is able to remove some of the solute stored in the unsaturated zone and this can mitigate the floodplain salinity risk. A conceptual model of the impact of groundwater extraction on floodplain salinization has been developed.

AB  - This paper investigates the complex interaction between a river and a saline floodplain in a semi-arid environment strongly influenced by groundwater lowering using a fully integrated physically-based numerical model. The main objective is to quantify the impacts of river stage manipulation on freshening of the shallow floodplain groundwater through bank storage. It is shown that river stage rises produce a relatively less saline floodplain aquifer with a larger freshwater lens. First, an increase in river stage reduces saline groundwater recharge to the floodplain. Second, the enhanced bank storage is able to freshen the groundwater near the river banks during high-flow pulses by mixing fresh water with saline groundwater. Overall, it was found that river stage manipulation may be considered as a short term salt management technique. However, if longer term strategies are required, it may be possible to implement these salt interception measures periodically. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The key to sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater for additional irrigation' is the salt balance of groundwater below an irrigated field. This paper aims to develop a mathematical tool to study the accumulation of salt in the groundwater below an irrigated field as caused by irrigation recirculation. This study derives a salt balance of groundwater to ensure that the additional irrigation from groundwater remains possible in the future. The water and salt budgets by themselves do neither provide information concerning farmers' options nor on the limits of the individual terms in the budget equations. It is presumed that farmers will intuitively aim for (1) an optimal value of the actual evapotranspiration, and (2) a return flow as a feasible low fraction of the available water. We, therefore, derive the irrigation from groundwater Q as a consequence of the predefined farmers' aims to achieve a high actual evapotranspiration in combination with a given optimally used irrigation system. Our model concludes that the required amount of drainage is only dependent on the ratio of the salinity in the surface irrigation water and the acceptable salinity of the groundwater. The final salinity in the saturated zone only depends on salt-carrying inflows and outflows. From the aforesaid model, it is further concluded that sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater for additional irrigation requires long-term salt management, which should be founded on the essential controlling factors as derived in this paper.

AB  - In a previous paper, the Amtoudi Oasis, a remote area in the northern Sahara in southern Morocco, was chosen to model the dynamics of groundwater-dependent economics under different scenarios of water availability, both the wet 2009-2010 and the average 2010-2011 hydrological years. Groundwater imbalance was reflected by net aquifer recharge (R) less than groundwater allotment for agriculture and urban uses in the average year 2010-2011. Three key groundwater sustainability issues from the hydrologic perspective were raised for future research, which are addressed in this paper. Introducing a feasible methodology for groundwater resource modelling for sustainable use in sparse-data drylands, this paper updates available databases, compiles new databases, and introduces new formulations to: (1) refine the net groundwater balance (W) modelling for years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, providing the magnitude of net lateral inflow from adjacent formations (R1), the largest R component contributing to the oasis; (2) evaluate the non-evaporative fraction of precipitation (P) (B) from 1973 onward as a proxy of the potential renewable water resource available for use; and (3) define the critical balance period for variables to reach a comparable stationary condition, as prerequisite for longterm modelling of W. RL was about 0.07-fold P and 0.85-fold R. Historical yearly B-to-P ratios were 0.02 for dry, 0.04 for average, and 0.07 for wet hydrological years; the average yearly P being 124 mm. A critical 17-year balance period with stable relative error below 0.1 was defined from the 44-year Pand B time-series statistical study. This is the monitoring period proposed for the stationary evaluation of the variables involved in the long-term modelling of W. This paper seeks to offer a feasible methodology for groundwater modelling addressed for planning sustainable water policies in sparse-data clrylancls. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A hydrological-economic model is introduced to describe the dynamics of groundwater-dependent economics (agriculture and tourism) for sustainable use in sparse-data drylands. The Amtoudi Oasis, a remote area in southern Morocco, in the northern Sahara attractive for tourism and with evidence of groundwater degradation, was chosen to show the model operation. Governing system variables were identified and put into action through System Dynamics (SD) modeling causal diagrams to program basic formulations into a model having two modules coupled by the nexus 'pumping': (1) the hydrological module represents the net groundwater balance (G) dynamics; and (2) the economic module reproduces the variation in the consumers of water, both the population and tourists. The model was operated under similar influx of tourists and different scenarios of water availability, such as the wet 2009-2010 and the average 2010-2011 hydrological years. The rise in international tourism is identified as the main driving force reducing emigration and introducing new social habits in the population, in particular concerning water consumption. Urban water allotment (P-U) was doubled for less than a 100-inhabitant net increase in recent decades. The water allocation for agriculture (P-I), the largest consumer of water, had remained constant for decades. Despite that the 2-year monitoring period is not long enough to draw long-term conclusions, groundwater imbalance was reflected by net aquifer recharge (R) less than P-I + PU (G < 0) in the average year 2010-2011, with net lateral inflow from adjacent Cambrian formations being the largest recharge component. R is expected to be much less than P-I + P-U in recurrent dry spells. Some low-technology actions are tentatively proposed to mitigate groundwater degradation, such as: wastewater capture, treatment, and reuse for irrigation; storm-water harvesting for irrigation; and active maintenance of the irrigation system to improve its efficiency.

AB  - An integrated methodology is proposed for the 3D visualisation of underground resources related to groundwater. A set of tools named HEROS3D was developed in a GIS environment to support the generation of 3D entities representing geological, hydrogeological, hydrochemical and geothermal features. It uses a geospatial database in which hard data and interpreted data are stored. The interpretation of geological data can be visualised in 3D as surfaces or fence diagrams, and as 3D representations of boreholes. Moreover, HEROS3D allows editing geological surfaces by several methods, getting involved in the 3D geological modelling. Along with the geological model, HEROS3D generates 3D visualisation of chemical values and piezometric levels, whose temporal evolution can be taken into account. In addition, three-dimensional representations of thermal plumes generated by the exploitation of shallow geothermal energy can be created and visualised jointly. In this way, all steps in hydrogeological modelling can be visualised in three-dimensional space, to facilitate understanding and validation of the model. Results are shown for a case study in Barcelona, Spain.

AB  - To deal with the challenge of groundwater over-extraction in arid and semi-arid environments, it is necessary to establish management strategies based on the knowledge of hydrogeological conditions, which can be difficult in places where hydrogeological data are dispersed, scarce or present potential misinformation. Groundwater levels in the southern Jordan Valley (Jordan) have decreased drastically in the last three decades, caused by over-extraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes. This study presents a local, two-dimensional and transient numerical groundwater model, using MODFLOW, to characterise the groundwater system and the water balance in the southern Jordan Valley. Furthermore, scenarios are simulated regarding hydrological conditions and management options, like extension of arable land and closure of illegal wells, influencing the projection of groundwater extraction. A limited dataset, literature values, field surveys, and the 'crop water-requirement method' are combined to determine boundary conditions, aquifer parameters, and sources and sinks. The model results show good agreement between predicted and observed values; groundwater-level contours agree with the conceptual model and expected flow direction, and, in terms of water balance, flow volumes are in accordance with literature values. Average annual water consumption for irrigation is estimated to be 29 million m(3) and simulation results show that a reduction of groundwater pumping by 40% could recover groundwater heads, reducing the water taken from storage. This study presents an example of how to develop a local numerical groundwater model to support management strategies under the condition of data scarcity.

AB  - The desert of eastern Libya forms one of the most arid regions of the Sahara. The Great Man-Made River Project (GMRP) was established. It transports millions of cubic meters of water a day from desert wellfields to the coastal cities, where over 80% of the population lives. The Tazerbo Wellfield is one of the wellfields designed within the GMRP, delivering water to the eastern coast of Libya through an underground pipe network. Tazerbo Wellfield consists of 108 production wells; each well was designed to pump 100 L/s. The planned total groundwater withdrawal from all wells is 1 million m(3)/d. The deep sandstone aquifer (Nubian sandstone) is covered by a thick mudstone-siltstone aquitard and is being heavily pumped. The aquifer and fine-grained sediments of the aquitard may be compacted resulting in land subsidence as a result of high exploitation. Local sinkholes have developed in the area of Tazerbo since the start of the pumping from the wellfield in 2004. These sinkholes have been caused mainly by lowering of the piezometric heads due to the withdrawal of groundwater. In this study, a hydrogeological investigation is presented about the effect of large groundwater pumping from the Nubian sandstone aquifer in Tazerbo Wellfield, SE Libya, based on physical parameters for 108 production wells and 23 observation wells.

AB  - Discrepancies can arise among surface flux measurements collected using disparate techniques due to differences in both the instrumentation and theoretical underpinnings of the different measurement methods. Using data collected primarily within a pair of irrigated cotton fields as a part of the 2008 Bush-land Evapotranspiration and Remote Sensing Experiment (BEAREX08), flux measurements collected with two commonly-used methods, eddy covariance (EC) and lysimetry (LY), were compared and substantial differences were found. Daytime mean differences in the flux measurements from the two techniques could be in excess of 200 W m(-2) under strongly advective conditions. Three causes for this disparity were found: (i) the failure of the eddy covariance systems to fully balance the surface energy budget, (ii) flux divergence due to the local advection of warm, dry air over the irrigated cotton fields, and (iii) the failure of lysimeters to accurately represent the surface properties of the cotton fields as a whole. Regardless of the underlying cause, the discrepancy among the flux measurements underscores the difficulty in collecting these measurements under strongly advective conditions. It also raises awareness of the uncertainty associated with in situ micrometeorological measurements and the need for caution when using such data for model validation or as observational evidence to definitively support or refute scientific hypotheses.

AB  - The aim of this work is to find a probabilistic characterization of the productive capacity of a well in a geological formation hosting an aquifer. Such characterization in terms of productive capacity may allow a preliminary assessment to be made of the probability of success for a required productivity (i.e. target point). This evaluation is usually carried out by statistical analysis of a geological dataset, which is likely to be influenced by many parameters. Such datasets are often incomplete or unreliable. Therefore, a method for evaluating potential productivity, using probabilistic hydraulic conductivity data, is proposed. The hydraulic characterization of hydrogeologic units is based on the collection of information obtained mainly through pumping tests and their interpretation. The results, expressed in terms of hydraulic conductivity, are summarized in a range of variability that is strictly dependent on the number of performed tests and their spatial distribution in the unit itself. If this range is known, an estimate of well's yield can be made on a deterministic basis, through Thiem's relationship for steady state conditions, by setting a value of hydraulic conductivity that corresponds to the average value of the range. The proposed reliability analysis enables to overcome the limitations of the deterministic approach by correlating each calculated flow rate, which is taken to be a design flow rate exceeding the critical flow rate of the hydrogeologic unit, to its probability of failure. Therefore, this approach aims to evaluate the probability of failure of the water system. The preliminary result is to associate the values of aquifer exploitation with a probability failure function. This outcome can then be used to define the potential solutions in the optimal allocation of the withdrawal by means of reliability analysis that takes into account the uncertainty of the system.

AB  - Sustainable management of water resources necessitates close attention to social, economic and environmental aspects such as water quality and quantity concerns and potential conflicts. This study presents a new fuzzy-based multi-objective compromise methodology to determine the socio-optimal and sustainable policies for hydro-environmental management of groundwater resources, which simultaneously considers the conflicts and negotiation of involved stakeholders, uncertainties in decision makers' preferences, existing uncertainties in the groundwater parameters and groundwater quality and quantity issues. The fuzzy multi-objective simulation-optimization model is developed based on qualitative and quantitative groundwater simulation model (MODFLOW and MT3D), multi-objective optimization model (NSGA-II), Monte Carlo analysis and Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM). Best compromise solutions (best management policies) on trade-off curves are determined using four different Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) methods. Finally, a unanimity fallback bargaining method is utilized to suggest the most preferred FSC method. Kavar-Maharloo aquifer system in Fars, Iran, as a typical multi-stakeholder multi-objective real-world problem is considered to verify the proposed methodology. Results showed an effective performance of the framework for determining the most sustainable allocation policy in groundwater resource management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fresh groundwater resources in Egypt contribute to some 20% of the total potential of water resources in Egypt. The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) increasingly recognizes its importance in the overall water resources management. The need for a more comprehensive groundwater management approach has led to the establishment of the Groundwater Sector (GWS) in December 1999. The GWS is now the sole responsible governmental agency for management of all groundwater resources and related water resources. The mandate of the GWS is: formulating and implementing the general policy for developing and managing groundwater and related water resources (flash floods, rainwater harvesting and desalinated water) on the national, regional and sub-regional level. Desalination of brackish groundwater in Egypt has a great potential. with respect to the availability of the resource. All major aquifer systems in Egypt contain vast quantities of brackish groundwater. The exploitation of this resource is still limited. With the current low price of brackish water desalination there is a growing interest towards its exploitation. Brackish water desalination plants in Egypt confirm the potential of this solution. Other uses for brackish groundwater that are being considered are agriculture (salt tolerant crops) and fisheries (shrimp farms). The elements of the vision for desalination of brackish groundwater are: environmental sustainability through recycling of water and re-infiltration; public-private partnerships for exploitation, especially in the tourism sector; private sector financing through accepted modalities (BOT, DBO, etc.). With the input of experience from the Netherlands through the GWS project a new program for desalination was started. This program aims to provide the necessary concepts and data on desalination of brackish groundwater in Egypt to allow the GWS to formulate a clear policy in this regard.

AB  - Water security is a key policy area for the Anthropocene; here we consider recent discourses of adaptive management in relation to water security. Definitions of water security emphasise the dual productive/destructive potentials of water, indicating its inherent economic, social and environmental complexity. Adaptive management has potential to address this social-ecological complexity because it supports a holistic approach. Although adaptive management is sometimes reduced to little more than conventional action under a new name, the potential for integrative, holistic, learning centred approaches remains within the concept of adaptation, and in the complementary conceptualisations of Integrated Water Resources Management, Social Learning and Resilience Thinking. Linking across policy fields (the water-food-energy-nexus) can only be achieved by these types of adaptive flexible and reflective approaches, and there is some, albeit tentative, moves in this direction in China's National Water Policy, the European Flood Directive and Australia's Murray-Darling Basin Plan. There is, however, much to do before water security, under an adaptive paradigm, becomes a concept and institutionalised practice that is continuously re-viewed and reconstructed to meet the needs of an ever changing world.

AB  - Safe-yield concepts historically focused attention on the economic and legal aspects of ground water development. Sustainability concerns have brought environmental aspects more to the forefront and have resulted in a more integrated outlook. Water resources sustainability is not a purely scientific concept, but rather a perspective that can frame scientific analysis. The evolving concept of sustainability presents a challenge to hydrologists to translate complex, and sometimes vague, socioeconomic and political questions into technical questions that can be quantified systematically. Hydrologists can contribute to sustainable water resources management by presenting the longer-term implications of ground water development as an integral part of their analyses.

AB  - This paper examines the problems of water shortage and quality issues in the Kingdom of Jordan. Demand for water has led to a decimation of ground water supplies and a significant rise in salinity. This rise in salinity can be traced to increasing saline base flows, the reduction in natural flows, changing extent of agriculture, agricultural practices, contamination of irrigation systems with saline inflow and poor infrastructural planning. Water security in Jordan is a very serious issue due to the rapid increase in population growth. Jordan is faced with the need to tighten regulations in water treatment, address the issue of domestic supply losses and illegal drawdown of ground water in the short term to gain significant inroads into the water problem. However, in the longer term, there is a need for a review of current infrastructure and its functionality, changing agricultural practice and finding sustainable sources of water.

AB  - The biosynthesis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall is targeted by some of the most powerful antituberculous drugs. To date, the molecular mechanisms by which these antibiotics affect the cell wall characteristics are not well understood. Here, we used atomic force microscopy - in three different modes - to probe the nanoscale surface properties of live mycobacteria and their modifications upon incubation with four antimycobacterial drugs: isoniazid, ethionamide, ethambutol, and streptomycine. Topographic imaging, combined with quantitative surface roughness analysis, demonstrated that all drugs induce a substantial increase of surface roughness to an extent that correlates with the localization of the target (i.e., synthesis of mycolic acids, arabinogalactans, or proteins). Chemical force microscopy with hydrophobic tips revealed that the structural alterations induced by isoniazid and ethambutol were correlated with a dramatic decrease of cell surface hydrophobicity, reflecting the removal of the outermost mycolic acid layer. Consistent with this finding, tapping mode imaging, combined with immunogold labeling, showed that the two drugs lead to the massive exposure of hydrophilic lipoarabinomannans at the surface. Taken together, these structural, chemical, and immunological data provide novel insight into the action mode of antimycobacterial drugs, as well as into the spatial organization of the mycobacterial cell wall.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is one of the most important forest biomes in Brazil, and this biome continues to disappear. This study looked at simulated and observed hydrological components in a small watershed containing fragments of the Atlantic Forest. The performance of the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) and the effects of possible land cover change scenarios in the Lavrinha Watershed, in the Mantiqueira Range, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, were analyzed. The model was calibrated and validated using four years of continuous hydro-climate data sets, and the simulated daily and monthly streamflow showed acceptable agreement with the observed. A comparison of hypothetical land cover change scenarios showed that deforestation in the Atlantic Forest biome leads to increases in monthly soil moisture (by 5%), overland flow (by 33%) and total runoff (by 22%), with a corresponding decrease in interception (by 71%), evapotranspiration (by 30%) and water table depth (by 10%). These changes in land surface hydrology resulted in an increase in daily high and low streamflows (by 17% and 25%), with the opposite occurring when pasture was converted to Atlantic Forest. The results also show that the hydrology of a headwater tropical watershed is characterized by seasonal variability in rainfall and land cover changes and that there are connections among the topography, land cover, soil types and wet and dry seasons that maintain the spatial distribution of the hydrologic components in the watershed.

AB  - Whereas human neutrophils are effective and efficient killers of bacteria, macrophages such as those derived from monocytes are almost devoid of killing activity. Nevertheless, monocytes can be transformed into effective killers of mycobacteria or staphylococci when exposed to clinical concentrations of a phenothiazine or to inhibitors of eff lux pumps (reserpine and verapamil), or to ouabain, an inhibitor of K+ transport. Because the rates of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) continue to escalate globally, and because no new effective drug has been made available for almost 40 years, compounds that enhance the killing activity of monocytes against MDR-TB are obviously needed. This review covers the specific characteristics of MDR-TB, identifies a variety of agents that address these characteristics and therefore have potential for managing MDR-TB. Because the mechanism by which these agents enhance the killing of intracellular bacteria is important for the intelligent design of new anti-tubercular agents, the review correlates the mechanisms by which these agents manifest their effects. Lastly, a model is presented which describes the mechanisms by which distinct efflux pumps of the phagosome-lysosome complex are inhibited by agents that are known to inhibit K+ flux. The model also predicts the existence of a K+ activated exchange (pump) that is probably located in the membrane that delineates the lysosome. This putative pump, which is immune to inhibitors of K+ flux, is identified as being the cause for the acidification of the lysosome thereby activating its hydrolytic enzymes. Because the non-killer macrophage can be transformed into an effective killer by a variety of compounds that inhibit K+ transport, perhaps it would be wise to develop drugs that enhance the killing activity of these cells inasmuch as this approach would not be subject to any resistance, as is the eventual case for conventional antibiotics.

AB  - Much attention has been paid to the issue of groundwater depletion linked to intensive groundwater-based agriculture in (semi-)arid areas. Often referred to as the "overexploitation" of aquifers, groundwater depletion is generally attributed to the entire agricultural sector without distinguishing between different uses and users. Although it expresses a general concern for future users, the ambiguous term of "overexploitation" does not acknowledge the contested nature of groundwater use and emerging inequalities. Also, the impact of inequality on groundwater depletion is rarely questioned. The aim of this article is to investigate how and by whom groundwater is depleted, and in turn, how unequal access to groundwater fuels the socioeconomic differentiation of farms and groundwater depletion. Based on a detailed analysis of groundwater use from a user perspective in two irrigated areas in North Africa (Morocco and Algeria), this study shows how the context of groundwater depletion exacerbates-and is exacerbated by-existing inequalities. The paper concludes that knowing how much is withdrawn, where, and by whom provides helpful information for more informed groundwater management by a better understanding of the response of users to declining groundwater conditions and the interests and incentives of different social categories of famers to contribute to groundwater management.

AB  - The present study emphasizes the use of groundwater sustainability indicators, developed to assess the sustainability of the aquifer in Uppar Odai sub-basin located in part of Tiruppur and Coimbatore districts, Tamil Nadu. There are seven indicators discussed based on their relevance in groundwater sustainability. In most parts of the subbasin, groundwater development already exceeds 80% of the groundwater recharge. The results have shown that the sub-basin area has been contaminated with low hazard pollutant such as nitrate and fluoride. In addition, about 28% and 32% of the sub-basin area respectively is not suitable for irrigation. The analysis of water level data for the last 42 years has shown decline in water table. However, the water level condition has improved in the recent years due to water conservation measures. The basin requires necessary groundwater planning and management to maintain sustainable aquifer condition.

AB  - The interaction between surface-water streams and groundwater in the Maules Creek catchment of northern New South Wales, Australia has been investigated using a wide range of techniques. Zones of groundwater discharge were mapped by measuring the temperature and fluid electrical-conductivity distribution in bores and surface water. Zones where surface water appears to be recharging the aquifer were investigated by measuring the vertical head gradient between the stream and adjacent bores and by estimates of the decreasing surface flow. Geological heterogeneity appears to be the most significant factor in controlling exchange. Lithological information was assembled using geophysical logging of existing bores, supplemented by the results of electrical resistivity imaging. A preliminary water balance was assembled from the available State records of groundwater abstraction for irrigation, rainfall, evapotranspiration and flow gauging in Maules Creek and the adjacent Namoi River. The analysis has demonstrated the complexity of these coupled systems and gives an indication of the most efficient techniques to be deployed in the field to investigate these complex but important systems.

AB  - Shorebirds migrating through the Southern Great Plains (SGP), USA, use freshwater playas and saline lakes as stopovers. The importance of playas is well documented, but the role of saline lakes is not clearly understood. During 2002 and 2003, we conducted surveys to determine the extent to which the saline lakes serve as stopovers. Twenty-eight species were recorded, and total seasonal abundance ranged from 6779 to 29,924 birds. Potential shorebird abundance for extant saline lakes was estimated at 37,000-71,000 shorebirds annually. American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana), Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), Baird's Sandpipers (C bairdi), Least Sandpipers (C minutilla), Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus), Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), and Wilson's Phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor) were the most abundant species. Community composition of shorebirds differed between saline lakes and regional freshwater playas. Peak spring abundance was generally in April, whereas summer/fall migration was more protracted and shorebird abundance peaked during 6-8 weeks in August and September. Migration chronologies differed among morphologically similar species, and among representative species from different guilds. Such patterns of temporal separation permit partitioning of resources by shorebirds migrating through the SGP. The saline lakes of the SGP should be regarded as stopover sites of regional and international value. To ensure that saline lakes function as stopovers and to help maintain those unique communities that inhabit them, conservation of saline takes should focus on preserving spring flows and conserving water.

AB  - Shorebirds migrating through the Southern Great Plains of North America use saline lakes as stopovers to rest and replenish energy reserves. To understand how availability of invertebrates, salinity, freshwater springs, vegetation, and water influence the value of saline lakes as migration stopovers, we compared lakes used and not used by migrant shorebirds. Shorebirds used lakes that had freshwater springs, mudflats and standing water, sparse vegetation (<= 1% cover), low to moderate salinities (x = 30.87 g/L), and mean invertebrate biomass of 0.79 g/m(2). Lakes that were not used were generally dry or had hypersaline water (x = 82.56 g/L), lacked flowing springs and vegetation, and had few or no invertebrates (x = 0.007 g/m(2)). Our results suggest that reduced spring flows and increased salinity negatively affect availability of shorebird habitats and aquatic invertebrates. We recommend preservation of the freshwater springs discharging in the saline lakes. Because the springs are discharged from the Ogallala aquifer, which is recharged through the playa wetlands, the entire complex of wetlands in the Great Plains and the Ogallala aquifer should be managed as an integral system.

AB  - The implementation of a geographic information system (GIS)/fuzzy spatial decision support system in the selection of sites for drinking-water pumping boreholes is described. Groundwater is the main source of domestic supply and irrigation in Korinthia prefecture, south-eastern Greece. Water demand has increased considerably over the last 30 years and is mainly met by groundwater abstracted via numerous wells and boreholes. The definition of the most "suitable" site for the drilling of new boreholes is a major issue in this area. A method of allocating suitable locations has been developed based on multicriteria analysis and fuzzy logic. Twelve parameters were finally involved in the model, prearranged into three categories: borehole yield, groundwater quality, and economic and technical constraints. GIS was used to create a classification map of the research area, based on the suitability of each point for the placement of new borehole fields. The coastal part of the study area is completely unsuitable, whereas high values of suitability are recorded in the south-western part. The study demonstrated that the method of multicriteria analysis in combination with fuzzy logic is a useful tool for selecting the best sites for new borehole drilling on a regional scale. The results could be used by local authorities and decision-makers for integrated groundwater resources management.

AB  - Pakistan is highly dependent on water resources originating in the mountain sources of the upper Indus for irrigated agriculture which is the mainstay of its economy. Hence any change in available resources through climate change or socio-economic factors could have a serious impact on food security and the environment. In terms of both ratio of withdrawals to runoff and per-capita water availability, Pakistan's water resources are already highly stressed and will become increasingly so with projected population changes. Potential changes to supply through declining reservoir storage, the impact of waterlogging and salinity or over-abstraction of groundwater, or reallocations for environmental remediation of the Indus Delta or to meet domestic demands, will reduce water availability for irrigation. The impact of climate change on resources in the Upper Indus is considered in terms of three hydrological regimes - a nival regime dependent on melting of winter snow, a glacial regime, and a rainfall regime dependent on concurrent rainfall. On the basis of historic trends in climate, most notably the decline in summer temperatures, there is no strong evidence in favour of marked reductions in water resources from any of the three regimes. Evidence for changes in trans-Himalayan glacier mass balance is mixed. Sustainability of water resources appears more threatened by socio-economic changes than by climatic trends. Nevertheless, analysis and the understanding of the linkage of climate, glaciology and runoff is still far from complete; recent past climate experience may not provide a reliable guide to the future.

AB  - Environmental land degradation is a major impediment to the utilization of land in many arid and semi-arid regions of the World and is a major issue in the East Nile Delta (END), Egypt. Waterlogging and salt-affected soil problems have serious implications for irrigated areas leading to socio-economic and agricultural development problems. In the present study, timely and accurate detection of land degradation through remote sensing and hydrosalinity indicators, along with their characteristics and severity classification in a GIS environment, has been undertaken to provide, determine, assess and map reliable geo-information of environmental land degradation. This research deals with an assessment of hydrosalinity and environmental land degradation based on some new, but simple and practical, approaches for assessing salinity and spread of land degradation through digital image processing, geo-statistics and geochemistry. This analysis utilises Landsat 8, ASTER GDEM data, hydrochemical and statistical analyses using a GIS, together with other field collected data sets for the same date of May 2014. The hydrosalinity mapping and the statistical data analysis of TDS, major ions, groundwater grouping and hydrochemical facies and also water table maps between 1994 and 2014 reveals that the main sources of groundwater recharge and water bodies are mostly attributed to the continuous seepage from newly cultivated lands. The new flow regime is the main contributing factor to the rising water level, water salinity and waterlogging problems. Moreover, the spatial distribution of major ion content could be attributed to the leaching of aquifer materials along the flow path (Na, Ca, and Cl), the study area affected by agricultural pollution (Mg and SO4) and the leaching process which acts on the easily soluble evaporate-rich fluvio-marine sediments of a shallow aquifer (NO3 and PO4). The spatial distribution maps of the physico-chemical properties of soil such as EC, pH, SAR, Na, Cl, SO4 and Ca are compared with remote sensing salinity indices and then integrated to classify and map the salinity and salt-affected soil by using GIS tools. These indicate that increases in soil salinity levels pose a serious threat to sustainable agricultural developments that requires special attention to maintain an appropriate soil-water plant relationship by providing an adequate drainage system. The identification of land degradation mitigation measures requires thorough knowledge of the ground and surface water, human activities, and the salinity dynamics of the study area.

AB  - The assessment of hydrometeorological hazards in the mountainous area of Southwestern Sinai area (SWSA) necessitates reliable and accurate information about natural hazards, especially flash floods. Flash floods are the main dangerous hazards that threaten lives and any sustainable development planning in and around the rugged topography areas. The SWSA receives occasional heavy rainstorms every two or four years, triggering destructive floods that runoff towards the Gulf of Suez. The present study aims to extract, evaluate, integrate and map the potential flash flood hazards by applying remote sensing, GIS tools and by statistically analyzing the geomorphometric parameters. Moreover, assessing the flash flood hazard risk ranks was carried for the three main basins (W. Baba, W. Sidri, and W. Nukhul). The drainage networks and basins were extracted from DEM then, delineated into seventy-two sub-basins and then the morphometric parameters of these sub-basins were estimated. The analysis of the various morphometric parameters of the three main basins shows that they have different effects on flash flood hazards. Depending on the statistical analysis of the commutative weights of the important geomorphometric parameters and GIS functions; the studied basins were categorized into three risk ranks; namely: high, moderate and low flash flood risk. The integration of the different controlling parameters revealed that the zones of high flash flood hazard risk are characterized by the low probability of groundwater recharge which should be put into consideration to help the decision makers avoid risks which are considered to be one of the most dangerous obstacles to the sustainable development of the study area.

AB  - Lakes are under increasing pressure due to widespread anthropogenic impacts related to rapid development and population growth. Accordingly, many lakes are currently undergoing a systematic decline in water quality. Recent studies have highlighted that global warming and the subsequent changes in water use may further exacerbate eutrophication in lakes. Lake evolution depends strongly on hydrologic balance, and therefore on groundwater connectivity. Groundwater also influences the sensitivity of lacustrine ecosystems to climate and environmental changes, and governs their resilience. Improved characterization of groundwater exchange with lakes is needed today for lake preservation, lake restoration, and sustainable management of lake water quality into the future. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to determine if the future evolution of the climate, the population, and the recharge could modify the geochemistry of lakes (mainly isotopic signature and quality via phosphorous load) and if the isotopic monitoring of lakes could be an efficient tool to highlight the variability of the water budget and quality. ' Small groundwater-connected lakes were chosen to simulate changes in water balance and water quality expected under future climate change scenarios, namely representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Contemporary baseline conditions, including isotope mass balance and geochemical characteristics, were determined through an intensive field-based research program prior to the simulations. Results highlight that future lake geochemistry and isotopic composition trends will depend on four main parameters: lo-cation (and therefore climate conditions), lake catchment size (which impacts the intensity of the flux change), lake volume (which impacts the range of variation), and lake G index (i.e., the percentage of groundwater that makes up total lake inflows), the latter being the dominant control on water balance conditions, as revealed by the sensitivity of lake isotopic composition. Based on these model simulations, stable isotopes appear to be especially useful for detecting changes in recharge to lakes with a G index of between 50 and 80 %, but response is non-linear. Simulated monthly trends reveal that evolution of annual lake isotopic composition can be dampened by opposing monthly recharge fluctuations. It is also shown that changes in water quality in groundwater-connected lakes depend significantly on lake location and on the intensity of recharge change.

AB  - Overexploitation of groundwater resources in coastal regions is a wide-spread phenomenon, especially in arid and in semi-arid regions, which may lead to deterioration and abandonment of coastal aquifers, due to saltwater intrusion. Development of mathematical and numerical models to describe fresh and salt water flow and to optimise groundwater development systems is essential for the protection and sustainable use of coastal aquifers. In this paper, we present applications of two different models that predict saltwater penetration in a coastal region, due to the operation of a production well. The well is located in an aquifer with different zones of hydraulic conductivity. The first model-SISWIM is a finite difference two-phase flow model, based on the assumption of a sharp interface between salt and fresh water, while the second one, is a simplified surrogate flow model based on the boundary element method. The aim of this paper is to compare the results and to explain the importance of having detailed information about hydraulic conductivity distribution in designing the sustainable exploitation of coastal groundwater systems.

AB  - Inverted wells, in which the solid casing extends over the full depth of the permeable aquifer, but with slotted screens projecting upwards alongside the solid casing, can provide high yields in moderately transmissive aquifers for which all permeable strata are within about 30 m of the non-pumping water level. The use of inverted wells has been pioneered in the Rajshahi Barind in northwest Bangladesh. Conceptual and computational models of inverted wells are developed. By examining a step-pumping test using a numerical model, the important flow processes are identified and quantified. The sustainability, of the substantial groundwater abstraction in the Rajshahi Barind is examined by considering the recharge processes which depend on losses from flooded rice fields, the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying Barind Clay and the seasonal recovery of observation well water levels.

AB  - In 1998, Tampa Bay Water, the largest wholesale water provider in South East USA with over 23 million customers, assumed the role of planning, developing, and operating water supply sources from six local water supply utilities through an Interlocal Agreement. Under the agreement, cities and counties served by the agency would have their water supply demands met unequivocally and share the cost of delivery and/or development of new supplies based on their consumption, allowing a more holistic approach to manage resources in the region. Consequently, the agency was able to plan and execute several components of its Long-Term Master Water Plan to meet the region's demand, as well as diversify its sources of water supply. Today, the agency manages a diverse and regionally interconnected water supply system that includes 13 wellfields, two surface water supply sources, off-site reservoir storage, a sea water desalination plant, a surface water treatment plant, and 14 pumping/booster stations. It delivers water through 390 km of large diameter pipe to 19 potable water connections. It uses state-of-the-practice computer tools to manage short and long-term operations and planning. As a result, after the agency's inception, groundwater pumpage was reduced by more than half in less than a decade-by far one of the largest cutback and smaller groundwater utilization rate compared to other utilities in Florida or elsewhere. The region was able to witness a remarkable recovery in lake and wetland water levels through the agency's use of this diverse mix of supply sources. For example, in the last three years, 45-65% of water supply came from groundwater sources, 35-45% from surface water sources and 1-9% from desalinated seawater-very different from 100% groundwater only supply just few years ago. As an "on demand" wholesale water provider, the agency forecasts water supply availability and expected water demands from seasonal to decadal time frames using a suite of forecasting tools and a structured decision-making process. This paper presents a case study of the approach taken by Tampa Bay Water to meet the region's growing water demands while satisfying other competing objectives in a sustainable fashion and documents the remarkable environmental improvement observed in the area.

AB  - This study explores a general framework for quantifying anthropogenic influences on groundwater budget based on normalized human outflow (h(out)) and inflow (h(in)). The framework is useful for sustainability assessment of groundwater systems and allows investigating the effects of different human water abstraction scenarios on the overall aquifer regime (e.g., depleted, natural flow-dominated, and human flow-dominated). We apply this approach to selected regions in the USA, Germany and Iran to evaluate the current aquifer regime. We subsequently present two scenarios of changes in human water withdrawals and return flow to the system (individually and combined). Results show that approximately one-third of the selected aquifers in the USA, and half of the selected aquifers in Iran are dominated by human activities, while the selected aquifers in Germany are natural flow-dominated. The scenario analysis results also show that reduced human withdrawals could help with regime change in some aquifers. For instance, in two of the selected USA aquifers, a decrease in anthropogenic influences by similar to 20% may change the condition of depleted regime to natural flow-dominated regime. We specifically highlight a trending threat to the sustainability of groundwater in northwest Iran and California, and the need for more careful assessment and monitoring practices as well as strict regulations to mitigate the negative impacts of groundwater overexploitation.

AB  - In modern oases situated in the south of Tunisia, secondary salination of irrigated lands is a crucial problem. The visible salt deposits and soil salination processes are the consequence of several factors including the excessive use of saline irrigation water, seepage from earthen canal systems, inefficient irrigation practices and inadequate drainage. Understanding the mechanism of the secondary salination is of interest in order to maintain existing oases, and thus ensure the sustainability of date production in this part of the Country. Therefore, a conceptual, daily, semi-distributed hydrologic model (OASIS-MOD) was developed to analyse the impact of irrigation management on the water table fluctuation, soil salinity and drain discharge, and to evaluate measures to control salinity within an oasis ecosystem. The basic processes incorporated in the model are irrigation, infiltration, percolation to the shallow groundwater, soil evaporation, crop transpiration, groundwater flow, capillary rise flux, and drain discharge. OASIS-MOD was tested with data collected in a parcel of farmland situated in the Segdoud oasis, in the south-west of Tunisia. The calibration results showed that groundwater levels were simulated with acceptable accuracy, since the differences between the Simulated and measured values are less than 0.22 in. However, the model under-predicted some water table peaks when irrigation Occurs due to inconsistencies in the irrigation water data. The validation results showed that deviations between observed and simulated groundwater levels have increased to about 0.5 m due to under-estimation Of groundwater inflow from an upstream palm plantation. A long-term Simulation scenario revealed that the soil salinity and groundwater level have three types of variability in time: a daily variability due to irrigation practices, seasonal fluctuation due to climatic conditions and annual variability explained by the increase in cultivated areas. The irrigation interval was found to be important with irrigating once each ten days leading to soil salinity increase during the dry summer season and to a rising water table during the autumn-winter period. The annual increase in the irrigated area caused a decrease of the irrigation water depths, and thus an augmentation of the soil and groundwater salinities. The surface area affected by a soil salinity concentration above 15 g/L has increased from 2% of the study parcel area in June 1992 to about 50% four years later due to the abandonment of several cultivated basins.

AB  - In developing countries such as Syria, the lack of hydrological data affects groundwater resource assessment. Groundwater models provide the means to fill the gaps in the available data in order to improve the understanding of groundwater systems. The study area can be considered as the main recharge area of the eastern side of Barada and Awaj basin in the eastern part of Mt. Hermon. The withdrawal for agricultural and domestic purposes removes a considerable amount of water. The steady-state three-dimensional (3D) groundwater model (FEFLOW which is an advanced finite element groundwater flow and transport modeling tool), was used to quantify groundwater budget components by using all available data of hydrological year 2009-2010. The results obtained may be considered as an essential tool for groundwater management options in the study area. The calibrated model demonstrates a good agreement between the observed and simulated hydraulic head. The result of the sensitivity analysis shows that the model is highly sensitive to hydraulic conductivity changes and sensitive to a lesser extent to water recharge amount. Regarding the upper aquifer horizon, the water budget under steady-state condition indicates that the lateral groundwater inflow from the Jurassic aquifer into this horizon is the most important recharge component. The major discharge component from this aquifer horizon occurs at its eastern boundary toward the outside of the model domain. The model was able to produce a satisfying estimation of the preliminary water budget of the upper aquifer horizon which indicates a positive imbalance of 4.6 Mm(3)y(-1).

AB  - The Barada and Awaj basin is the most important and extensively used water basin in Syria. Chemical and isotopic data of groundwater have been used to determine the spatial distribution of hydrogeological features in the upper part of Awaj River catchment area located southwest of this basin. Hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater reveals the domination of dissolution/precipitation mechanisms in these very complex stratigraphic sequences. The dissolution of carbonate rocks as well as reverse cation exchange processes seem to be the main factors controlling groundwater mineralization. The isotopic composition of precipitation and groundwater indicate that the modern-day atmospheric precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge before an important evaporation occurred. The isotopic data also imply an existence of hydraulic connection between the different aquifers system. The results obtained allowed us to delineate two main spatial groundwater zones within the study area with different flow components. The south, central and eastern parts are considered to be one zone which is characterised by a shallow horizontal flow associated with active interaction between groundwater and hosting rocks. The nitrate concentrations in this zone are attributed to anthropogenic sources. The second zone consists in south-western, western and north-western parts where the karstic features are well developed mainly in the Jurassic strata. This zone is characterized by a high vulnerability to pollution confirmed by high values of nitrate coming from sewage water. The deep vertical groundwater flow component seems to be dominant in this zone and is controlled by fractures and geological structures.

AB  - This paper presents an evolutionary based approach to achieve optimal management of a coastal aquifer to control saltwater intrusion. An improved Elitist Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (ECACO) algorithm is employed for optimal control variables setting of coastal aquifer management problem. The objectives of the optimal management are; maximizing the total water-pumping rate, while controlling the drawdown limits and protecting the wells from saltwater intrusion. Since present work is one of the first efforts towards the application of an ECACO algorithm, sharp interface solution for steady state problem is first exploited. The performance of the developed optimization model is evaluated through application examples available in the literature. The comparisons indicate the applicability of the ECACO algorithm. In the second approach, the numerical simulation is combined with ECACO algorithm. In this model, through some simple schemes, such as continuity equations in the porous media cells and existing hydraulic systems in the study area, further details can be investigated. The evaluation results show the potential applicability of the proposed numerical based model for optimal management of coastal aquifers.

AB  - This paper examines a linked simulation-optimization procedure based on the combined application of an artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) with the aim of developing an efficient model for the multiobjective management of groundwater lenses in small islands. The simulation-optimization methodology is applied to a real aquifer in Kish Island of the Persian Gulf to determine the optimal groundwater-extraction while protecting the freshwater lens from seawater intrusion. The initial simulations are based on the application of SUTRA, a variable-density groundwater numerical model. The numerical model parameters are calibrated through automated parameter estimation. To make the optimization process computationally feasible, the numerical model is subsequently replaced by a trained ANN model as an approximate simulator. Even with a moderate number of input data sets based on the numerical simulations, the ANN metamodel can be efficiently trained. The ANN model is subsequently linked with GA to identify the nondominated or Pareto-optimal solutions. To provide flexibility in the implementation of the management plan, the model is built upon optimizing extraction from a number of zones instead of point-well locations. Two issues are of particular interest to the research reported in this paper are: (1) how the general idea of minimizing seawater intrusion can be effectively represented by objective functions within the framework of the simulation-optimization paradigm, and (2) the implications of applying the methodology to a real-world small-island groundwater lens. Four different models have been compared within the framework of multiobjective optimization, including (1) minimization of maximum salinity at observation wells, (2) minimization of the root mean square (RMS) change in concentrations over the planning period, (3) minimization of the arithmetic mean, and (4) minimization of the trimmed arithmetic mean of concentration in the observation wells. The latter model can provide a more effective framework to incorporate the general objective of minimizing seawater intrusion. This paper shows that integration of the latest innovative tools can provide the ability to solve complex real-world optimization problems in an effective way.

AB  - Knowledge of groundwater residence times and recharge locations is vital to the sustainable management of groundwater resources. Here we investigate groundwater residence times and patterns of recharge in the Gellibrand Valley, southeast Australia, where outcropping aquifer sediments of the Eastern View Formation form an "aquifer window" that may receive diffuse recharge from rainfall and recharge from the Gellibrand River. To determine recharge patterns and groundwater flow paths, environmental isotopes (H-3, C-14, delta C-13, delta O-18, delta H-2) are used in conjunction with groundwater geochemistry and continuous monitoring of groundwater elevation and electrical conductivity. The water table fluctuates by 0.9 to 3.7m annually, implying recharge rates of 90 and 372 mm yr(-1). However, residence times of shallow (11 to 29 m) groundwater determined by C-14 are between 100 and 10 000 years, 3H activities are negligible in most of the groundwater, and groundwater electrical conductivity remains constant over the period of study. Deeper groundwater with older C-14 ages has lower delta O-18 values than younger, shallower groundwater, which is consistent with it being derived from greater altitudes. The combined geochemistry data indicate that local recharge from precipitation within the valley occurs through the aquifer window, however much of the groundwater in the Gellibrand Valley predominantly originates from the regional recharge zone, the Barongarook High. The Gellibrand Valley is a regional discharge zone with upward head gradients that limits local recharge to the upper 10 m of the aquifer. Additionally, the groundwater head gradients adjacent to the Gellibrand River are generally upwards, implying that it does not recharge the surrounding groundwater and has limited bank storage. C-14 ages and Cl concentrations are well correlated and Cl concentrations may be used to provide a first-order estimate of groundwater residence times. Progressively lower chloride concentrations from 10 000 years BP to the present day are interpreted to indicate an increase in recharge rates on the Barongarook High.

AB  - Monitoring and assessment of the coastal aquifers are becoming a worldwide concern for the need of additional and sustainable water resources to satisfy demographic growth and economic development. A hydrochemical and geoelectrical investigation was conducted in the El-Omayed area in the northwestern coast of Egypt. The aim of the study was to delineate different water-bearing formations, provide a general evaluation of groundwater quality, and identify the recharge sources in aquifers. Thirty-seven water samples were collected and chemically analyzed from the sand dune accumulations and oolitic limestone aquifers. Fifteen profiles of vertical electrical soundings (VESs) were obtained in the oolitic limestone aquifer to examine the variations of subsurface geology and associated groundwater chemistry. The groundwater reserves in the El-Omayed area are mainly contained in sand dune accumulations and oolitic limestone aquifers. The aquifer of sand dune accumulations contains freshwater of low salinity (average total dissolved solids (TDS) = 974 mg/l). Groundwater of oolitic limestone aquifer is slightly brackish (average TDS = 1,486 mg/l). Groundwater of these aquifers can be used for irrigation under special management for salinity control, and regular leaching as indicated by electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio. Results of VES interpretation classified the subsurface sequence of oolitic limestone aquifer into four geoelectric zones, with increasing depth, calcareous loam, gypsum, oolitic limestone, and sandy limestone. Oolitic limestone constitutes the main aquifer and has a thickness of 12-32 m.

AB  - Changing environmental conditions and increased water consumption have transformed many historically perennial stream systems into intermittent systems. Multiple drying and wetting events throughout the year might impact many stream processes including nitrification and denitrification, key components of the nitrogen (N) cycle. During summer 2007, an experimental stream was used to dry and then rewet stream sediments to determine the effects of desiccation and rewetting of stream sediment on nitrification and denitrification potentials. Mean (+/- SE) nitrification and denitrification rates in sediment not dried (controls) were 0.431 +/- A 0.017 mu g NO(3) (-)-N/cm(2)/h and 0.016 +/- A 0.002 mu g N(2)O-N/cm(2)/h, respectively. As sediment samples dried, nitrification rates decreased. Rates in sediments dried less than 7 d recovered to levels equal or greater than those in the controls within 1 d of being rewetted. Denitrification rates were not affected by 1 d of drying, but samples dried greater than 1 d experienced reduced rates of denitrification. Denitrification in sediments dried 7 d or less recovered by day seven of being rewetted. Nitrification and denitrification processes failed to fully recover in sediments dried more than 7 d. These results demonstrate that alterations in stream's hydrology can significantly affect N-cycle processes.

AB  - Groundwater is a major source of water for domestic, industrial and agricultural uses in many parts of the world, where arid environments are common. Groundwater was collected from 120 wells in a semi-arid and calcareous area, area of Gaziantep, Southeastern Anatolia to determine hydrochemical characteristics, mechanisms for nitrate transport, the concentration of major ions. Relationships between ion concentrations (as meq/L) were analyzed through linear modeling and calculation of coefficients of determination (R-2). The relationships between NO3 and alkaline earth metal ions (M2+) (excess [Ca2+Mg2+] over [HCO3-]) were investigated. There is a strong linear relationship (R-2>0.90) between molar concentrations of the excess M2+ and NO3- ions. Nitrogen compounds originating primarily from microbially-driven processes such as nitrification are expected to react with carbonate minerals (e.g., CaCO3) and may migrate to groundwater as in the following reaction; 2NO(3)((aq))(-) + CaCO3(s) -> Ca(NO3)(2(aq)) + CO3(aq)2-

AB  - During the last three decades, the expansion of irrigation using both surface water and groundwater resources has had an important positive impact on Syria's agricultural production. It is an example of success in achieving food policy objectives, but it has also introduced the challenge of groundwater sustainability. This paper examines the trends in groundwater abstraction for irrigation and the effect of government policies, including input subsidies such as the diesel fuel subsidy and the crop procurement price support. The fuel subsidy is an important driving force in groundwater depletion and overabstraction. This analysis examines the interaction between policy signals and the use and allocation of water by farmers. The rapid decline in groundwater resources shows the limitations of this agricultural development strategy and questions its sustainability unless policies change and the rate of abstraction is changed so as not exceed the recharge rate.

AB  - Jordan with its limited water resources is currently classified as one of the four water-poor countries worldwide. This study was initiated to explore groundwater potential areas in Tulul al Ashaqif area, Jordan, by integrating remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and multicriteria evaluation techniques. Eight thematic layers were built in a GIS and assigned using multicriteria evaluation techniques suitable weights and ratings regarding their relative contribution in groundwater occurrence. These layers include lithology, geomorphology, lineaments density, drainage density, soil texture, rainfall, elevation, and slope. The final groundwater potentiality map generated by GIS consists of five groundwater potentiality classes: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. The map showed that the study area is generally of moderate groundwater potentiality (76.35 %). The very high and high potential classes occupy 2.2 and 12.75 % of study area, respectively. The validity of results of this GIS-based model was carried out by superimposing existing hand dug wells on the final map. The single parameter sensitivity test was conducted to assess the influence of the assigned weights on the groundwater potential model, and new effective weights were derived. The resulted groundwater potentiality map showed that the area occupied by each of the groundwater potentiality classes has changed. However, the study area remains generally of moderate groundwater potentiality (70.93 % of the study area). The area occupied by the very high and high potential classes comprises 4.53 and 18.56 % of the study area, respectively.

AB  - Collective action to remedy the losses of open access to common-pool resources often is late and incomplete, extending rent dissipation. Examples include persistent over exploitation of oil fields and ocean fisheries, despite general agreement that production constraints are needed. Contracting costs encountered in assigning property rights are an explanation, but analysis of their role is limited by a lack of systematic data. We examine governance institutions in California's 445 groundwater basins using a new dataset to identify factors that influence the adoption of extraction controls. In 309 basins, institutions allow unconstrained pumping, while an additional 105 basins have weak management plans. Twenty of these basins are severely overdrafted. Meanwhile, users in 31 basins have defined groundwater property rights, the most complete solution. We document the critical role of the transaction costs associated with contracting in explaining this variation in responses. This research adds to the literatures on open access, transaction costs, bargaining, and property rights. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A groundwater monitoring network can provide quantity and quality data necessary to make informed decisions regarding the state of the environment. A properly designed monitoring system provides a representative understanding of the state of the monitored area. The selection of the optimum number of monitoring sites and their spatial distribution is a major challenge for the hydrogeologist. On the one hand, improper distribution of monitoring sites or insufficient number of sites will not provide a representative view of the state of the environment. On the other hand, if the sampled sites are too many, the information obtained is redundant and the monitoring network is costly and inefficient. A new methodology combining vulnerability mapping and geostatistics is proposed to help define the most efficient groundwater quality monitoring network on a regional scale. Vulnerability mapping identifies areas with high pollution potential, and in turn, prioritises for monitoring. A geostatistics methodology is then used to interpret the obtained data and to examine the spatial distribution of monitored parameters at different sites. The accuracy of spatial mapping reflects the effectiveness of the distribution of the monitoring sites. The methodology was applied to assess the nitrate monitoring network in the Heretaunga basin, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. The DRASTIC approach was used to prepare a vulnerability map for the area of study, and kriging variance was used to check the spatial distribution of the sites. Based on this study, it was found that some areas with high vulnerability are not covered within the existing network indicating the number of monitoring sites and their distribution is not efficient. Some sites should be dropped and some others need to be added to the existing network. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable management of small island freshwater resources requires an understanding of the extent of freshwater lens and local effects of pumping. In this study, a methodology based on a sharp interface approach is developed for regional and well scale modeling of island freshwater lens. A quasi-three-dimensional finite element model is calibrated with freshwater thickness where the interface is matched to the lower limit of the freshwater lens. Tongatapu Island serves as a case study where saltwater intrusion and well salinization for the current state and six long-term stress scenarios of reduced recharge and increased groundwater pumping are predicted. Though no wells are salinized currently, more than 50% of public wells are salinized for 40% decreased recharge or increased groundwater pumping at 8% of average annual recharge. Risk of salinization for each well depends on the distance from the center of the well field and distance from the lagoon. Saltwater intrusions could occur at less than 50% of the previous estimates of sustainable groundwater pumping where local pumping was not considered. This study demonstrates the application of a sharp interface groundwater model for real-world small islands when dispersion models are challenging to be implemented due to insufficient data or computational resources.

AB  - While the sustainability of resource depletion is a longstanding environmental concern, wider attention has recently been given to growing water scarcity and groundwater depletion. This study seeks to test the substitutability assumption embedded in weak sustainability indicators using a case study of Californian water supply. The volume of groundwater depletion is used as a proxy for unsustainable water consumption, and defined by synthesising existing research estimates into low, medium and high depletion baselines. These are compared against projected water supply increases from ocean desalination and water recycling by 2035, to determine whether new, drought-proof water sources can substitute for currently unsustainable groundwater consumption. Results show that the maximum projected supply of new water, 2.47 million acre-feet per year (MAF/yr), is sufficient to meet low depletion estimates of 2.02 MAF/yr, but fails to come near the high depletion estimate of 3.44 MAF/yr. This does not necessarily indicate physical limitations of substitutability, but more so socio-economic limitations influenced by high comparative costs. By including capacities in demand-substitutability via urban water conservation, maximum predicted capacities reach 5.57 MAF/yr, indicating wide room for substitution. Based on these results, investment in social and institutional capital is an important factor to enhance demand-side substitutability of water and other natural resources, which has been somewhat neglected by the literature on the substitutability of natural resources.

AB  - In metazoans, the mechanisms of transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and accelerated decay of messenger RNA (mRNA) following transcription shutdown are linked by sharing the same sequence elements and mRNA elongation, processing and termination factors. This begs the question, how could one process have two opposite outcomes, making or degrading mRNA? An integrated "allosteric-GENEi-torpedo" model that could explain this paradox predicts participation of two novel factors: (1) An allosteric factor, regulated by a physiological repressor, binds to a unique sequence element of a gene near the site of cleavage and polyadenylation, poly(A) site, and acts on the homologous site on the nascent transcript to cause its cleavage. The conformational changes of this factor determine the fate of nascent RNA, either to get cleaved and processed to mature mRNA for directing protein synthesis, or not to get cleaved and become template for double-stranded (ds) RNA synthesis. (2) A general transcription termination factor, recruited by transcribing Pol IIt the poly(A) site, allostrically alters and induces Pol IIo switch template from DNA to nascent RNA several hundred nucleotides downstream of the poly(A) site. The template switch disengages Pol IIrom DNA and effectively terminates transcription. The Pol II with newly acquired RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity retraces its path, back along the nascent RNA, so generating dsRNA. The extent to which it can retrace this path is determined by the factors influencing the cleavage of the pre-mRNA at the site of polyA addition. If cleavage and polyadenylation occur, the retracing is cut short, the 3' RNA is degraded by an exonuclease and the polymerase is liberated to reinitiate transcription. If the cleavage is inhibited, then a full-length dsRNA can be produced. This can then be subject to cleavage by "Dicer", which generates fragments of similar to 22 bp that guide degradation of the cognate mRNA via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. This model complements the current "allosteric-torpedo" model of transcription termination, and could explain the apparent paradox of the divergent results of a common biological process.

AB  - Determining the yield of a production well remains one of the main problems in hydrogeological studies. Starting from the results of a 3-year-long monitoring of a continuously exploited well functioning at constant head (i.e., at a variable discharge rate), a new pumping style has been examined using numerical models. The objective is to control the impact of pumping on the aquifer in accordance with the principle of sustainability. Different models were developed in a transient state and were calibrated using discharge data of the well during the recession periods. Successively, the trends of the residual outflow from the aquifer system with the well operating at variable discharge and at constant discharge were simulated. The results indicate that the ratio of the volume of water pumped from the well to the volume of residual outflow is a significant indicator of the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals. Modeling confirms that a constant discharge rate can be derived from the information gained through a preliminary production phase of a well at constant head. This approach appears to be particularly useful when the problem is determining the sustainable yield of a single well from aquifers with low hydraulic diffusivity.

AB  - Analysis of radiocarbon and stable isotopes of C, H and O in groundwater samples from the coastal watershed of Southeastern Tanzania is used to decipher the age of groundwater and the climatic conditions at the time of recharge. Radiocarbon dating was corrected on the basis of stable carbon isotope ratios and hydrochemical data. Two main recharge periods are recognised: (1) a recent recharge period with residence times dated to younger than 1.3 ka BP, for the shallow aquifer and some deep groundwater aquifers; and (2) a paleorecharge occurring during the Late Pleistocene to Holocene transition (between 6 and 13 ka BP), for the lower confined aquifer. The climatic excursions (arid and humid phases) identified in this study match well with those identified from studies of paleo-climatic records in Tanzania and East Africa. The oxygen-18 and radiocarbon results show that there is a potential mixing of groundwater of varying ages along flow paths in the coastal aquifer system. This has also been shown by redox parameters in some of the deeper aquifer samples. The data also revealed that there is relatively simple pattern of lateral groundwater flow in the deeper confined aquifer. Isotopic evidence from this study and related studies in paleolimnology improves our knowledge of the past climates. The data suggests that the paleorecharge to the confined aquifer was from inland under wetter climatic conditions than present. Therefore, paleorecharge from the adjacent mountain regions to coastal area like Ifakara, Morogoro and Udzungwa mountains could be important parts of recharge area of the Kimbiji aquifer. However, the hinterland mountains of Dar es Salaam (mainly Pugu, Mkuranga, Ruvu and Kisarawe) could also play an important role in replenishing the Kimbiji coastal aquifers. In contrast, recharge in the shallow unconfined aquifer is characterized by local rainfall and river water infiltration. This study is the first of its kind, assessing fingerprinting of paleoclimates in Southeastern coastal Tanzania using the isotopic composition of deep groundwater aquifers. The freshwater resources in the Neogene aquifer contain paleo-groundwater aquifers that have been mixed with recently-recharged flow systems. Hence, the resources may be sustainable. This study also provides information that may be useful for designing optimum strategies for a sustainable management of groundwater resources in the coastal aquifer, and it testifies to the importance of groundwater as a paleoclimatic archive. Such information is also essential for consideration by modellers in their attempts to simulate the hydrogeological processes in confined aquifers over very long time spans. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Groundwater recharge for Bugesera region, a potable water-scarce area in northeastern Burundi, is computed using the soil moisture budget technique. Five evapotranspiration methods including Hamon, Hargreaves, Thornthwaite and two modifications of the original Thornthwaite method are evaluated in comparison to the reference evapotranspiration method, i.e. the FAO Penman-Monteith equation for years where complete climatic data is available. The evapotranspiration calculated by the aforementioned methods along with rainfall data are used to compute the soil moisture budget. The latter is calculated using the methodology devised by Thornthwaite & Mather (1955). Recharge calculation is performed using both the Thornthwaite Monthly Water-Balance Model (henceforth TMWB model) and excel sheets wherein each term of the soil moisture budget is computed separately. The results of evapotranspiration calculations show that, while the other evaporation methods slightly to moderately underestimate or overestimate the pote tial evapotranspiration in comparison to the FAO Penman-Monteith method, Hargreaves equation aberrantly overestimates this parameter. Likewise, groundwater recharge estimated using Hargreaves' evapotranspiration is dramatically reduced in comparison to the other evapotranspiration methods. Moreover, this study clearly shows that the time discretisation used in recharge calculations has important consequences, the use of smaller time steps leading to enhanced recharge. This better corresponds to reality. Compared to the recharge values obtained on a daily basis with Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration, the TMWB model which is on a monthly basis, using Hamon's evapotranspiration, gives the best approximations of reality, with the advantage of needing much less data. The distribution pattern of monthly recharge features a bimodal pattern somewhat similar to that of the monthly rainfall with an important peak in April.

To achieve the water planning outcomes of the National Water Initiative, we need a common understanding of the issues, informed and supported by both research-based scientific expertise and local experiential knowledge of the resource system and risks of changes to the consumptive pool, to return overdrawn water systems to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction. In addition, recognition of regional differences, Indigenous needs, and impacts of land-use and climate change are required. We focus on how participatory approaches of interpretation and communication of scientific knowledge about groundwater hydrology can assist communities' understanding and acceptance of the need for better management.

AB  - Numerical simulation of groundwater flow used for the estimation of hydraulic and hydrologic parameters which is an important tool for the management of aquifers. This study presents the results of a mathematical model developed for the simulation of groundwater flow in Nahavand plain aquifer in the southwest Hamadan province. For this purpose Groundwater Modeling Software (GMS) was used which supports the MODFLOW-2000 code. After gathering required data such as the hydrological, hydrogeological and topography maps, a 3D hydrogeological model of plain was constructed with borehole and surface elevation data. Then MODFLOW was used for simulation of flow. After initial simulation of the flow, the model was calibrated in steady state with trial-and-error and parameter estimation methods the observed head of groundwater table monitoring data of 1997. Results of calibration show that error between observed head and computed head is in allowable range. Also results of computed head with model show that groundwater flow is in the direction of the dominate slope (southeast to northwest). Finally MODPATH code which simulates advective transport of particles was used for estimation of flow path and source of contaminants.

AB  - In hardrock terrain where seasonal streams are not perennial source of freshwater, increase in ground water exploitation has already resulted here in declining ground water levels and deteriorating its' quality. The aquifer system has shown signs of depletion and quality contamination. Thus, to secure water for the future, water resource estimation and management has urgently become the need of the hour. In order to manage groundwater resources, it is vital to have a tool to predict the aquifer response for a given stress (abstraction and recharge). Artificial neural network (ANN) has surfaced as a proven and potential methodology to forecast the groundwater levels. In this paper, Feed-Forward Network based ANN model is used as a method to predict the groundwater levels. The models are trained with the inputs collected from field and then used as prediction tool for various scenarios of stress on aquifer. Such predictions help in developing better strategies for sustainable development of groundwater resources.

AB  - An integrated approach for assessing the availability of groundwater under conditions of 'global-change' is presented. The approach is embedded in the DANUBIA system developed by the interdisciplinary GLOWA-Danube Project to simulate the interaction of natural and socio-economic processes within the Upper Danube Catchment (UDC, 77,000 km(2) and located in parts of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy). The approach enables the quantitative assessment of groundwater bodies (zones), which are delineated by intersecting surface watersheds, regional aquifers, and geomorphologic regions. The individual hydrogeological and geometrical characteristics of these zones are accounted for by defining characteristic response times and weights to describe the relative significance of changes in variables (recharge, groundwater level, groundwater discharge, river discharge) associated with different states. These changes, in each zone, are converted into indices (GroundwaterQuantityFlags). The motivation and particularities of regional-scale groundwater assessment and the background of GLOWA-Danube are described, along with a description of the developed methodology. The approach was applied to the UDC, where several different climate scenarios (2011-2060) were evaluated. A selection of results is presented to demonstrate the potential of the methodology. The approach was inspired by the European Water Framework Directive, yet it has a stronger focus on the evaluation of global-change impacts.

AB  - A spatially distributed water balance model is developed to simulate tong-term average recharge depending on land cover, soil texture, topography and hydrometeorological parameters. The model simulates recharge iteratively connected to a groundwater model, such that the recharge estimate is also influenced by the groundwater depth and vice versa. Parameter estimation for the model is performed on the basis of literature values of water balance fluxes from mainly Belgium and The Netherlands. By graphical and non-linear baseflow separation for 17 catchments it is shown that recharge spatially varies considerably. The water balance model coupled to a regional groundwater model is applied and successfully tested on the 17 catchments. The application shows that the resulting recharge has a spatial complex pattern, depending to a large extend on the soil texture and land cover. Moreover, shallow groundwater levels in valleys cause negative recharge conditions as a result of evapotranspiration by abundant phreatophytic vegetation. GIS analysis shows how recharge strongly varies for different combinations of land cover and soil texture classes. The performed analysis provides a better insight into the sustenance and management of groundwater resources. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The potential of environmental tracers (delta O-18, delta C-13, C-14, He-4, Ne-20, Ar-40, N-2) to assist our understanding of recharge processes, groundwater flow velocities and residence times in semi-confined, multilayered and faulted aquifer systems was tested in a coastal system with Quaternary sediments overlying Tertiary aquifers and fractured bedrock. Carbon-14 groundwater ages were found to increase with depth and distance (< 1000 y near the recharge area to > 30,000 y near the coast), confirming that the system is semi-confined and the palaeometeoric origin of groundwater as suggested by water stable isotopes. The presence of old groundwater near the top of deep semi-confined aquifers suggests that recharge mainly occurs in the ranges east of the basin. This is also supported by Cl concentrations, which are higher in the overlying Quaternary aquifers. Groundwater flow velocities between 0.3 and 1.8 m y(-1) were estimated using C-14 ages, resulting in basin recharge estimates between 0.3 x 10(7) and 2 x 10(7) m(3) y-1, Radiocarbon and He-4-estimated flow velocities were generally in good agreement, although He-4 accumulation rates ranging between 8 x 10(-12) and 1 x 10(-10) cm(3) STP g(-1) Y-1 and 1.7-7.1 x 10(-7) cm(3) STP g(-1) km(-1) confirmed slower flow velocities in some areas. These areas could not be captured using C-14. Faults were found to play a paramount role on mixing old fluids rich in salts and He-4, although it was not possible to demonstrate the role of faults in changing flow velocities, this requiring a higher density of sampling points. Our study shows that environmental tracers have potential to study flow processes in semi-confined, faulted, multilayered aquifer systems, provided a high density of sampling points is available.

AB  - Particular visions of urban development are often codified in multi-year resource management policies. These policies, and the negotiations leading to them, are based in specific problem frames and narratives with long legacies. As conditions change and knowledge improves, there is often a need to revisit how problems, opportunities, and development pathways were defined historically, and to consider the viability of alternative pathways for development. In this article, we examine the case of agriculture near Metropolitan Phoenix, in the Central Arizona region, to highlight how frames and narratives embedded in policy can reinforce particular development pathways, even as information, conditions, and values evolve. Using expert interviews and secondary data, we document alternative frames and narratives that may offer different pathways for development and sustainability in the region. By highlighting alternative narratives, we demonstrate the uncertainties and limitations associated with all narratives about development pathways, and explore the possibilities that narrative shifts can alter future outcomes.

AB  - Assessing the sensitivity of groundwater systems to hydroclimate variability is critical to sustainable management of the water resources of Guam, US territory. We assess spatial and temporal variability of isotopic and geochemical compositions of vadose and phreatic groundwater sampled from cave drip sites and production wells, respectively, to better understand the vulnerability of the freshwater lens on Guam to variability in hydroclimate. We independently evaluate the existing conceptual model of the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer that is largely based on physical, as opposed to geochemical, observations. Sampling was conducted from 2008 to 2015, over which rainfall gradually increased. Major ion geochemistry and Sr isotope values of groundwater show varying influence from soil, limestone bedrock, and seawater. Geochemical modeling that can explain spatial variability in groundwater Na+ and Mg2+ concentrations and Sr/Ca and Sr-87/Sr-86 values indicates that groundwater compositions are dominantly controlled by mixing of freshwater with seawater and water-rock interaction. Differences between amount-weighted annual average precipitation delta O-18 values and groundwater delta O-18 values indicate a recharge bias toward the wet season, consistent with other tropical carbonate island aquifer settings. Infra- and inter-annual variations in Na+ concentrations and delta O-18 values in groundwater reflect sensitivity of recharge to seasonal variations in rainfall amount and changes in annual rainfall amounts. Our results indicate the influence of multiple modes of recharge on groundwater compositions and spatial variability in the sensitivity of groundwater to seawater mixing. This sensitivity of the freshwater lens points to the vulnerability of groundwater resources to changes in recharge associated with climate, land-use change, and increases in population.

AB  - A steady-state groundwater model that incorporates the vadose zone in an approximate fashion is developed to account for situations where recharge may be significantly affected by heterogeneity above the water table. The model is intended for basin-scale applications where the exact representation of the unsaturated zone is no longer feasible. The pseudo-unsaturated model is compared to a variably saturated model making use of an idealized cross-section approximating the complex Oro Moraine aquifer system. Differences in predicted flow regimes between the two models arise from the coarser mesh used in the pseudo-unsaturated simulations, but are minimal below the water table. The pseudo-unsaturated model yields an accurate overall system water mass balance although a loss in spatial resolution of predicted fluxes may occur. Such accuracy losses are offset by drastically lower computer memory requirements. The flow simulations further show that near-surface heterogeneity has a profound impact on the sustainable capacity of a groundwater system and the location of sensitive recharge areas. The pseudo-unsaturated model is then coupled to a high-conductivity layer atop the model domain to simulate rainfall runoff. An important advantage of this model formulation is that precipitation and evapotranspiration measurements can be directly used as model input, while groundwater infiltration is part of the flow solution. Runoff and baseflow contributions to long-term streamflow generation are also calculated and can be compared to data from gauging stations during model calibration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Groundwater resources are under stress in many regions of the world and the future water supply for many populations, particularly in the driest places on Earth, is threatened. Future climatic conditions and population growth are expected to intensify the problem. Understanding the factors that control groundwater storage variation is crucial to mitigate its adverse consequences. In this work, we apply satellite-based measurements of ground deformation over the Tertiary detritic aquifer of Madrid (TDAM), Central Spain, to infer the spatio-temporal evolution of water levels and estimate groundwater storage variations. Specifically, we use Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) data during the period 1992-2010 and piezometric time series on 19 well sites covering the period 1997-2010 to build groundwater level maps and quantify groundwater storage variations. Our results reveal that groundwater storage loss occurred in two different periods, 1992-1999 and 2005-2010 and was mainly concentrated in a region of similar to 200 km(2). The presence of more compressible materials in that region combined with a long continuous water extraction can explain this volumetric deficit. This study illustrates how the combination of PSI and piezometric data can be used to detect small aquifers affected by groundwater storage loss helping to improve their sustainable management.

AB  - Groundwater levels in a deep phreatic aquifer in the northern Perth Basin, Western Australia have risen between 10 and 55 cm/y over the last three decades due to the replacement of deep-rooted native vegetation with pasture and annual crops, This has sparked debate over increasing groundwater allocation limits to meet growing demand. Estimates of recent and historical rates of groundwater recharge are needed to manage the resource effectively. The Parmelia Formation, composed predominantly of sandstone, supplies domestic, stock and production bores for rural towns. Groundwater recharge was estimated using several recharge estimation techniques including the water-table fluctuation method and tracer techniques; groundwater chloride, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and C-14, Vertical fluxes of soilwater under pasture and native vegetation were determined using chloride as a tracer, Apparent groundwater ages determined using CFCs and carbon-14 are generally younger than 40 years in piezometers that are screened within a few metres of the water-table from recharge under pasture, while groundwater is older than several thousand years in bores that are screened well below the water-table, and mixed waters occur at discharge areas. Recharge-rate estimates obtained under native vegetation are mainly < 12 mm/y, whereas after replacement with pasture and annual crops, recharge rates are generally 20-50 mm/y. The presence of thick clay lenses in some areas may be responsible for observed delays of approximately one decade in the water-table response to land-use change. The study highlighted the fact that several recharge estimation techniques are required for better understanding of recharge processes and evaluation of recharge.

AB  - The joint effect of changes in climate and land use on the future availability of water resources was assessed under the SRES A1B and A2 climate scenarios as well as five land use scenarios for the 2080-2100 time-frame in an Italian coastal watershed. The study area is a small coastal polder (100 km(2)) characterized by irrigated agriculture, urban expansion, drainage, quarrying and sensitivity to salt-water intrusion. The hydroclimatic budget and the GALDIT index have been computed for assessing water resources availability and groundwater vulnerability to salinization, respectively. The methodology developed is integrated into a tool based on Excel (TM),which supported the development of scenarios in participatory processes. The conclusions emerged from the analysis are the following: (1) climate change is more effective than land use change in controlling future freshwater availability and amplifies the imbalance between winter surplus and summer deficits, (2) freshwater availability in the summer will likely be affected by an increase in evaporation from open water surfaces due to increased temperature, whereas winter surplus would increase, (3) the vulnerability of the coastal aquifer to salinization will probably moderately increase but an inherent limitation of the GALDIT index to land use change parameters prevents a sound assessment. Strategies that may be proposed to administrators and stakeholders are based on increasing storage of seasonal water surplus.

AB  - In this study we propose a multi-source data approach for quantifying long-term flooding and aquifer recharge in ungauged ephemeral rivers. The methodology is applied to the Buffels River, at 9000 km(2) the largest ephemeral river in Namaqualand (NW South Africa), a region with scarce stream flow records limiting research investigating hydrological response to global change. Daily discharge and annual flood series (1965-2006) were estimated from a distributed rainfall-runoff hydrological model (TETIS) using rainfall gauge records located within the catchment. The model was calibrated and validated with data collected during a two year monitoring programme (2005-2006) at two stream flow stations, one each in the upper and lower reaches of the catchment. In addition to the modelled flow records, non-systematic flood data were reconstructed using both sedimentary and documentary evidence. The palaeoflood record identified at least 25 large floods during the last 700 yr; with the largest floods reaching a minimum discharge of 255 m(3) s(-1) (450 yr return period) in the upper basin, and 510 m(3) s(-1) (100 yr return period) in the lower catchment. Since AD 1925, the flood hydrology of the Buffets River has been characterised by a decrease in the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods, with palaeoflood discharges (period 1500-1921) five times greater than the largest modelled floods during the period 1965-2006. Large floods generated the highest hydrograph volumes, however their contribution to aquifer recharge is limited as this depends on other factors such as flood duration and storage capacity of the unsaturated zone prior to the flood. Floods having average return intervals of 5-10 yr (120-140 m(3) s(-1)) and flowing for 12 days are able to fully saturate the Spektakel aquifer in the lower Buffets River basin. Alluvial aquifer storage capacity limiting potential recharge by the largest floods is a common problem in arid environments, with the largest infiltration volumes favoured by increasing depth to groundwater levels.

AB  - A long-term flood record from the Buffels River, the largest ephemeral river of NW South Africa (9250 km(2)), was reconstructed based on interpretation of palaeoflood, documentary and instrumental rainfall data. Palaeoflood data were obtained at three study reaches, with preserved sedimentary evidence indicating at least 25 large floods during the last 700 yr. Geochronological control for the palaeoflood record was provided by radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Annual resolution was obtained since the 19th century using the overlapping documentary and instrumental records. large floods coincided in the past within three main hydroclimatic settings: (1) periods of regular large flood occurrence (1 large flood/similar to 30 yr) under wetter and cooler prevailing climatic conditions (AD 1600-1800), (2) decreasing occurrence of large floods (1 large flood/similar to 100 yr) during warmer conditions (e.g., AD 1425-1600 and after 1925), and (3) periods of high frequency of large floods (similar to 4-5 large floods in 20-30 yr) coinciding with wetter conditions of decadal duration, namely at AD 1390-1425, 1800-1825 and 1915-1925. These decadal-scale periods of the highest flood frequency seem to correspond in time with changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, as inferred when comparing their onset and distribution with temperature proxies in southern Africa.

AB  - The South West of Western Australia has experienced an enormous water resources challenge from a drying climate in recent decades. Increased groundwater extraction has helped meet water demand, but has tested the capacity of groundwater laws to keep extraction within sustainable limits. This article draws from Western Australia's experience to explore an important question facing a number of regions of the world due to climate change: how can groundwater use be maintained within sustainable limits in a drying climate? This article suggests that there is a better chance of achieving this goal with a regulatory framework that covers all significant extraction activities, takes climate change projections into account, has flexible water entitlements and saves some of the groundwater as a drought reserve'.

AB  - The Cannara aquifer (Umbria, Italy) has been known for more than a century, and is one of the main drinking water supplies in the Umbria Region. In the beginning it was used for irrigation purposes, since this area was mainly agricultural up to the 1960s. The groundwater-exploited by Umbra Acque S.p.A. (a Company supplying drinking water)-is 150 m under ground level and is contained in a porous confined aquifer, which originally had artesian characteristics. Exploitation of 200-300 l/s with nine wells caused a reduction of piezometric level, maintaining the confined aquifer conditions, except for a very short period during which the aquifer was depressurised by drought, and for increase of emergency withdrawals replacing other water supplies (from springs) for drinking purposes. The occasional presence of iron and ammonium ions confirms the confinement of the groundwater and their hydrochemical facies in a redox environment, while in nearby areas and shallow aquifers anthropogenic contaminants (nitrates and chlorinated solvents) are reported. For the protection of this aquifer of strategic interest (the most important well field in Umbria), all hydrological and hydrochemical data available have been reviewed, and the aquifer recharge studied. Sustainable rates of withdrawal, and groundwater protection areas have been identified using a numerical flow model. Further action for monitoring groundwater of both shallow and artesian aquifers, together with well-revamping, have been proposed.

AB  - Hydrochemical and stable isotopic (H-2, O-18) data were used to characterize the groundwater flow and major chemical features within a complex fractured volcanic aquifer system, the Argnat basin, which is located in the Chaine des Puys (French Massif Central). From 10 sampling points, the study of the transfer into the saturated zone from upstream to downstream, given the geological context and topography, allows to estimate the role of supply from high and low altitudes to the recharge processes. This work shows the existence of different types of supply between pahoehoe and a'a flows. Therefore, the morphology of volcanic flows impacts the chemical and isotopic signatures of groundwater, enhancing or reducing the influence of the unsaturated zone on the pathways of infiltrated water. Pahoehoe flows imply horizontal water flows of low discharge at the top of the lava whereas a'a flows seems to be much more heterogeneous and locally able to promote the existence of perched water bodies and further vertical circulations. Taking into account these two types of behaviour, a conceptual scheme of the functioning of this heterogeneous environment is proposed, which will help towards a sustainable management of volcanic aquifers in relation with the European Union Groundwater Directive (2006/118/CE) (2006).

AB  - 1. There are increasing demands to predict ecohydrological responses to future changes in catchments but such predictions will be inevitably uncertain because of natural variability and different sources of knowledge (epistemic) uncertainty. 2. Policy setting and decision-making should therefore reflect these inherent uncertainties in both model predictions and potential consequences. 3. This is the focus of a U.K. Natural Environment Research Council knowledge exchange project called the Catchment Change Network (CCN). The aim is to bring academics and practitioners together to define Guidelines for Good Practice in incorporating risk and uncertainty into assessments of the impacts of change. 4. Here, we assess the development of such Guidelines in the context of having catchment models of everywhere.

AB  - There is a strong drive towards hyperresolution earth system models in order to resolve finer scales of motion in the atmosphere. The problem of obtaining more realistic representation of terrestrial fluxes of heat and water, however, is not just a problem of moving to hyperresolution grid scales. It is much more a question of a lack of knowledge about the parameterisation of processes at whatever grid scale is being used for a wider modelling problem. Hyperresolution grid scales cannot alone solve the problem of this hyperresolution ignorance. This paper discusses these issues in more detail with specific reference to land surface parameterisations and flood inundation models. The importance of making local hyperresolution model predictions available for evaluation by local stakeholders is stressed. It is expected that this will be a major driving force for improving model performance in the future.

AB  - Dryland salinity threatens many high-value assets in Australia. Assessing the technical feasibility of intervention requires consideration of spatial and temporal dimensions of land management and associated surface-groundwater interactions. This paper presents results regarding the practicability of protecting assets in a 371,000-ha agriculturally dominated catchment in south-eastern Australia using a physically-based catchment model, the Catchment Analysis Tool (CAT). The model links surface land management and hydrology at the paddock scale (daily time step growth and water use, crop rotations and management) with a fully distributed groundwater model enabling the assessment of agronomic versus engineering options for landscape asset protection. Scenarios assessing management options and costs of planting of perennial vegetation or engineering through groundwater pumping are outlined. The impacts of scenarios are reported under future climatic conditions as well as for the 'steady state' response. The study demonstrates a linked surface-groundwater modelling approach to estimate groundwater capture zones, response times to equilibrium under current and climate change conditions, as well as groundwater abstraction volumes required to protect landscape features. These factors are important considerations for evidence-based decision making about protecting assets from dryland salinity. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater recharge sustains groundwater discharge, including natural discharge through springs and the base flow to surface water as well as anthropogenic discharge through pumping wells. Here, for the first time, we compute long-term (1996-2015) groundwater recharge rates using data retrieved from several groundwater-level monitoring locations across India (3.3 million km(2) area), the most groundwater-stressed region globally. Spatial variations in groundwater recharge rates (basin-wide mean: 17 to 960 mm yr(-1)) were estimated in the 22 major river basins across India. The extensive plains of the Indus-Ganges-Brahmaputra (IGB) river basins are subjected to prevalence of comparatively higher recharge. This is mainly attributed to occurrence of coarse sediments, higher rainfall, and intensive irrigation-linked groundwater-abstraction inducing recharge by increasing available groundwater storage and return flows. Lower recharge rates (< 200 mm yr(-1)) in most of the central and southern study areas occur in cratonic, crystalline fractured aquifers. Estimated recharge rates have been compared favorably with field-scale recharge estimates (n = 52) based on tracer (tritium) injection tests. Results show that precipitation rates do not significantly influence groundwater recharge in most of the river basins across India, indicating human influence in prevailing recharge rates. The spatial variability in recharge rates could provide critical input for policymakers to develop more sustainable groundwater management in India.

AB  - Groundwater is one of the most important natural resources for economic development and environmental sustainability. In this study, we estimated groundwater storage in 11 major river basins across Alberta, Canada, using a combination of remote sensing (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, GRACE), in situ surface water data, and land surface modeling estimates (GWSA(sat)). We applied separate calculations for unconfined and confined aquifers, for the first time, to represent their hydrogeological differences. Storage coefficients for the individual wells were incorporated to compute the monthly in situ groundwater storage (GWSA(obs)). The GWSA(sat) values from the two satellite-based products were compared with GWSA(obs) estimates. The estimates of GWSA(sat) were in good agreement with the GWSAobs in terms of pattern and magnitude (e.g., RMSE ranged from 2 to 14 cm). While comparing GWSAsat with GWSA(obs), most of the statistical analyses provide mixed responses; however the Hodrick-Prescott trend analysis clearly showed a better performance of the GRACE-mascon estimate. The results showed trends of GWSA(obs) depletion in 5 of the 11 basins. Our results indicate that precipitation played an important role in influencing the GWSA(obs) variation in 4 of the 11 basins studied. A combination of rainfall and snowmelt positively influences the GWSA(obs) in six basins. Water budget analysis showed an availability of comparatively lower terrestrial water in 9 of the 11 basins in the study period. Historical groundwater recharge estimates indicate a reduction of groundwater recharge in eight basins during 1960-2009. The output of this study could be used to develop sustainable water withdrawal strategies in Alberta, Canada.

AB  - A linked simulation-optimization model using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) is developed for deriving multiple objective management strategies for coastal aquifers. The GA-based optimization approach is especially suitable for externally linking a numerical simulation model within the optimization model. However, the solution of a linked simulation-optimization model is computationally intensive, as a very large number of iterations between the optimization and the simulation models are necessary to arrive at an optimal management strategy. Computational efficiency and feasibility for such linked models can be enhanced by simplifying the simulation process by an approximation. A possible approach for such approximation is the use of an ANN model. In this paper, an ANN model is developed initially as an approximate simulator of the three-dimensional density dependent flow and transport processes in a coastal aquifer. A simulation-optimization model is then developed by linking the ANN model with a GA-based optimization model for solving multiple objective saltwater management problems. The performance of the optimization models is evaluated using an illustrative study area. For comparison of the solution results, a multiple objective management model is also solved using embedded formulation and classical nonlinear optimization technique. The comparison of results shows potential feasibility of the proposed methodology in solving multiple objective management model for coastal aquifers.

AB  - The flow and transport processes in a coastal aquifer are highly nonlinear, where both the flow and transport processes become density dependent. Therefore, numerical simulation of the saltwater intrusion process in such an aquifer is complex and time consuming. An approximate simulation of those complex flow and transport processes may be very useful, if sufficiently accurate, especially where repetitive simulations of these processes are necessary. A simulation methodology using a trained artificial neural network model (ANN) is developed to approximate the three-dimensional density dependent flow and transport processes in a coastal aquifer. The data required for initially training the ANN model is generated by using a numerical simulation model (FEMWATER). The simulated data consisting of corresponding sets of input and output patterns are used to train a multilayer perceptron using the back-propagation algorithm. The trained ANN predicts the concentration at specified observation locations at different times. The performance of the ANN as a simulator of the density dependent saltwater intrusion process in a coastal aquifer is evaluated using an illustrative study area. These evaluation results show that the ANN technique can be successfully used for approximating the three-dimensional flow and transport processes in coastal aquifers.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion management models can be used to derive optimal and efficient management strategies for controlling saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. To obtain physically meaningful optimal management strategies, the physical processes involved need to be simulated while deriving the management strategies. The flow and transport processes involved in coastal aquifers are difficult to simulate especially when the density-dependent flow and transport processes need to be modeled. Incorporation of this simulation model within an optimization-based management model is very complex and difficult. However, as an alternative, it is possible to link a simulation model externally with an optimization-based management model. The GA-based optimization approach is especially suitable for externally linking the numerical simulation model within the optimization model. Further efficiency in computational procedure can be achieved for such a linked model, if the simulation process can be simplified by approximation, as very large number of iterations between the optimization and simulation model is generally necessary to evolve an optimal management strategy. A possible approach for approximating the simulation model is to use a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as the approximate simulator. Therefore, an ANN model is trained as an approximator of the three dimensional density-dependent flow and transport processes in a coastal aquifer. A linked simulation - optimization model is then developed to link the trained ANN with the GA-based optimization model for solving saltwater management problems. The performance of the developed optimization model is evaluated using an illustrative study area. The evaluation results show the potential applicability of the developed methodology using a GA- and ANN-based linked optimization - simulation model for optimal management of coastal aquifer.

AB  - Realistic representations of geological complexity are important to address several engineering and environmental challenges. The spatial distribution of properties controlling physical and geochemical processes can be effectively described by the geological structure of the subsurface. In this work, we present an approach to account for geological structure in geostatistical simulations of categorical variables. The approach is based on the extraction of information from a deterministic conceptualization of the subsurface, which is then used in the geostatistical analysis for the development of models of spatial correlation and as soft conditioning data. The approach was tested to simulate the distribution of four lithofacies in highly heterolithic Quaternary deposits. A transition probability-based stochastic model was implemented using hard borehole data and soft data extracted from a 3-D deterministic lithostratigraphic model. Simulated lithofacies distributions were also used as input in a flow model for numerical simulation of hydraulic head and groundwater flux. The outputs from these models were compared to corresponding values from models based exclusively on borehole data. Results show that soft lithostratigraphic information increases the accuracy and reduces the uncertainty of these predictions. The representation of the geological structure also allows a more precise definition of the spatial distribution of prediction uncertainty, here quantified with a metric based on Shannon information entropy. Correlations between prediction uncertainties for lithofacies, hydraulic heads and groundwater fluxes were also investigated. The results from this analysis provide useful insights about the incorporation of soft geological data into stochastic realizations of subsurface heterogeneity, and emphasize the critical importance of this type of information for reducing the uncertainty of simulations considering flux-dependent processes.

AB  - The three most westerly states of southern Australia have the largest area of water repellent soils, which limit agricultural production, of any country in the world. Simplified principles of the problems caused by repellency and the principles of soil management solutions are considered and related to experimental evidence. The phenomena of diverted soil water flow and isolated dry soil can explain most of the problems caused by repellency. Plant adaptation, soil or hydrophobic removal, reduced soil drying, reduced surface tension, water harvesting, avoidance, masking and, perhaps, water movement along dead root systems are the main soil management principles. Dead roots may play a role in zero till cropping systems, allowing more uniform wetting of dry hydrophobic soil at the base of a dead plant and along the dendritic pattern of the dead root system. Application of these management principles, especially water harvesting, avoidance and masking (by the use of deep trenching, furrow sowing methods or claying), have made a considerable improvement to sustainability and productivity of farming systems on the water repellent soils of Australia. Evidence is selected to assess risks of preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching for different agricultural soil management methods. All management methods can have some risks, but claying seems to have the least risk and furrowing the highest risk of encouraging preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching. It is suggested we have insufficient information and understanding to quantify the risks of groundwater contamination for different environments, farming systems and soil management methods to control repellency. There is an urgent need to develop quantified guidelines to minimise any possible groundwater contamination hazard for the extensive areas using farming systems with furrows and increasing amounts of pesticide and fertiliser.

AB  - RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII) is a fundamental enzyme, but few studies have analyzed its activity in living cells. Using human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) type 1 reporters, we study real- time messenger RNA ( mRNA) biogenesis by photobleaching nascent RNAs and RNAPII at specific transcription sites. Through modeling, the use of mutant polymerases, drugs, and quantitative in situ hybridization, we investigate the kinetics of the HIV- 1 transcription cycle. Initiation appears efficient because most polymerases demonstrate stable gene association. We calculate an elongation rate of approximately 1.9 kb/ min, and, surprisingly, polymerases remain at transcription sites 2.5 min longer than nascent RNAs. With a total polymerase residency time estimated at 333 s, 114 are assigned to elongation, and 63 are assigned to 3'- end processing and/ or transcript release. However, mRNAs were released seconds after polyadenylation onset, and analysis of polymerase density by chromatin immunoprecipitation suggests that they pause or lose processivity after passing the polyA site. The strengths and limitations of this kinetic approach to analyze mRNA biogenesis in living cells are discussed.

AB  - A groundwater monitoring and modeling program in two aquifers within the lower Nestos river basin in Northern Greece is presented. A monitoring network of 54 wells was developed in the two study areas, and groundwater level measurements and water quality sample analyses were conducted for a period of 2.5 years, from March 2007 to October 2009. The field data were used for the calibration and verification of the mathematical model MODFLOW in the two aquifers. The validated model was used to examine ten alternative management scenarios regarding groundwater abstraction in the two aquifers. The study showed that MODFLOW, if properly validated, is a useful and flexible tool in groundwater resources management.

AB  - Due to increasing demands and competition for high quality groundwater resources in many parts of the world, there is an urgent need for efficient methods that shed light on the interplay between complex natural settings and anthropogenic impacts. Thus a new approach is introduced, that aims to identify and quantify the predominant processes or factors of influence that drive groundwater and lake water dynamics on a catchment scale. The approach involves a non-linear dimension reduction method called Isometric feature mapping (Isomap). This method is applied to time series of groundwater head and lake water level data from a complex geological setting in Northeastern Germany. Two factors explaining more than 95% of the observed spatial variations are identified: (1) the anthropogenic impact of a waterworks in the study area and (2) natural groundwater recharge with different degrees of dampening at the respective sites of observation. The approach enables a presumption-free assessment to be made of the existing geological conception in the catchment, leading to an extension of the conception. Previously unknown hydraulic connections between two aquifers are identified, and connections revealed between surface water bodies and groundwater. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Irrigation systems have changed significantly in the last 50 years. Originally supplied by surface water, its farming systems depend increasingly on the massive use of groundwater through private tubewells. Withdrawals are currently leading to a general decrease in groundwater table levels which in the past caused waterlogging due to excess surface irrigation. This new context calls for the repositioning of the paradigm of the twin menace of waterlogging and salinity in which the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) community defined its concepts. It also requires taking into consideration existing groundwater institutions, often informal and developed locally, more rarely legally recognized processes when moving towards groundwater governance. We present an analytical framework showing the role of these institutions in groundwater governance. This special issue contains a selection of papers presented at the 24th European Regional Conference of ICID in March 2011, organized by its French National Committee, AFEID. The selected contributions focus on critical analysis of formal and informal institutions at the local scale dealing with groundwater access, restoring the groundwater balance and water quality protection. We argue that these analyses can help building a more process-oriented approach to policy and engineering, contributing to new modes of groundwater governance.

AB  - Groundwater resources in the Tadla basin stem from surface water recharge and different groundwater inflows, forming a multilayered aquifer system, which hosts one of Morocco's most important groundwater reservoirs. The hydrodynamic infrastructure; i.e. the relationship between all regional aquifers, recharge, and the residence time of waters poses a serious challenge for current water management and future exploitation in aiming for a long-term sustainable utilization. A combined hydrogeologic and isotopic investigation using hydrochemical and isotopic tracers such as (18)O, (2)H, (3)H, (13)C and (14)C was carried out in order to determine the sources of water recharge to the aquifers, the groundwater flow system, and the residence time of these waters. More than one hundred point measurements throughout the Study area in varying wells, boreholes, springs and rivers were investigated. Chemical compositions of the groundwater indicate an important influence by the host carbonate rocks from each of the Tadla aquifers. Stable isotope results indicate the existence of two groups of groundwater corresponding to the unconfined aquifer in the north and the confined aquifer in the south. The delta(18)O, delta(2)H, (3)H, and (14)C data indicate that the High Atlas Mountains in the south and east of the basin, which are characterized by high rainfall and low delta(18)O and delta(2)H values, are currently the major source of recharge for the Tadla aquifers. A significant recharge zone lies in the northern part of the basin where all the aquifers outcrop. The confined zones show depleted (18)O values, corresponding to the signature of recharge water from the Atlas Mountains. Moreover, all isotope data demonstrated clearly that the Tassaout springs, which are located in the southwest of the basin and were previously interpreted as representing natural outlet of the deep aquifers, are comprised of young waters with depleted (18)O and (2)H signatures, suggesting a high altitude recharge from the Atlas Mountain. In contrast, the unconfined parts of the aquifers show higher values of delta(18)O, indicating an evaporation phenomenon, which occurs during infiltration or recharge from irrigation. The mixing process of old and recent waters is confirmed by (14)C and (3)H. The isotopic data also indicates probable interaction and flow between the different aquifers. The isotopic and hydrochemical data is therefore essential in confirming possible mixing relationships between aquifers whereas traditional hydraulic data is not capable to provide a quantitative assessment of these relationships. The data generated in this study will certainly encourage the revision and improvement of the current hydrological water resources model for the Tadla basin. The results provide a framework for development of a comprehensive management plan in which water exploitation shifts towards areas with modern recharge and where young and high quality groundwater is found.

AB  - The study focuses on the characterization of the groundwater salinity on the Nador coastal aquifer (Algeria). The groundwater quality has undergone serious deterioration due to overexploitation. Groundwater samplings were carried out in high and low waters in 2013, in order to study the evolution of groundwater hydrochemistry from the recharge to the coastal area. Different kinds of statistical analysis were made in order to identify the main hydrogeochemical processes occurring in the aquifer and to discriminate between different groups of groundwater. These statistical methods provide a better understanding of the aquifer hydrochemistry, and put in evidence a hydrochemical classification of wells, showing that the area with higher salinity is located close to the coast, in the first two kilometers, where the salinity gradually increases as one approaches the seaside and suggests the groundwater salinization by seawater intrusion.

AB  - Recent surveys of groundwater invertebrates (stygofauna) worldwide are yielding rich troves of biodiversity, with significant implications for invertebrate systematists and phylogeneticists as well as ecologists and groundwater managers. What is the ecological significance of this high biodiversity of invertebrates in some aquifers? How might it influence groundwater ecosystem services such as water purification or bioremediation? In terrestrial ecosystems, biodiversity is typically positively correlated with rates of ecosystem functions beneficial to humans (e. g. crop pollination). However, the links between biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem services in groundwater are unknown. In some aquifers, feeding, movement and excretion by diverse assemblages of stygofauna potentially enhance groundwater ecosystem services such as water purification, bioremediation and water infiltration. Further, as specific taxa apparently play 'keystone' roles in facilitating ecosystem services, declines in abundance or even their extinction have serious repercussions. One way to assess the functional significance of biodiversity is to identify 'ecosystem service providers', characterise their functional relationships, determine how service provision is affected by community structure and environmental variables, and measure the spatio-temporal scales over which these operate. Examples from Australian and New Zealand alluvial aquifers reveal knowledge gaps in understanding the functional importance of most stygofauna, hampering effective protection of currently undervalued groundwater ecosystem services.

AB  - The phase distribution of trace metals and oxyanions, including U and As, in 2 surface water bodies was investigated within a South Texas watershed hosting a high density of surface U mine pits and tailings. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the environmental legacy of U mining, with particular emphasis on the spatial and temporal variability of water quality in Lake Corpus Christi, a downstream reservoir that serves as the major water resource to a population of similar to350,000 people in the region. Lyssy Pond, a livestock pond bordered by U mine tailings, was used as a model case-study site to evaluate the cycling of U mine-derived oxyanions under changing redox conditions. Although the pond showed seasonal thermal and chemical stratification, geochemical cycling of metals was limited to Co and Pb, which was correlated with redox cycling of Mn mineral phases, and U, which suggested reductive precipitation in the pond's hypolimnion. Uranium levels, however, were too low to support strong inputs from the tailings into the water column of the pond. The strong relationships observed between particulate Cr, Cs, V, and Fe suggest that these metals are associated with a stable particulate phase (probably allochthonous alumino-silicates) enriched in unreactive Fe. This observation is supported by a parallel relationship in sediments collected across a broad range of sediment depositional processes (and histories) in the basin. Arsenic, though selectively enriched in the pond's water column, was dominated by dissolved species throughout the depth of the profile and showed no sign of geochemical cycling or interaction with Fe-rich particles. Arsenic (and other oxyanions) in the water columns of Lake Corpus Christi and Lyssy pond were not affected by the abundant presence of Fe-rich particles but instead behaved conservatively. No evidence was found of anthropogenic impacts of U mines beyond the purely local scale. Arsenic's presence within the Nueces drainage basin is related to interactions between surface and groundwaters with U- and As-rich geological formations rather than large-scale transport of contaminants downstream of the U mine pits and tailings. A quantitative mass balance model, constructed using monthly hydrological data for the reservoir, provides quantitative evidence of seasonal evaporative concentration of As in surface waters demonstrating the predominance of hydrodynamic over geochemical constraints, on the cycling of this element.

AB  - Although water resources managers speak of a water crisis in Africa, the management of ground water has to date not featured strongly in national and regional African water agendas. Examination of the physical environment of the continent and, in particular, the water resources in relation to the socioeconomic landscape and regional development challenges makes it clear that widely occurring, albeit largely low-yielding, ground water resources will be crucial in the achievement of water security and development. Ground water is important primarily in domestic water and sanitation services, but also for other local productive needs like community gardens, stock watering, and brick-making, all essential to secure a basic livelihood and thus to alleviate poverty. Despite the importance of small-scale farming in Africa, there is little information on the present and potential role of ground water in agriculture. In contrast to its socioeconomic and ecological importance, ground water has remained a poorly understood and managed resource. Widespread contamination of ground water resources is occurring, and the important environmental services of ground water are neglected. There appear to be critical shortcomings in the organizational framework and the building of institutional capacity for ground water. Addressing this challenge will require a much clearer understanding and articulation of ground water's role and contribution to national and regional development objectives and an integrated management framework, with top-down facilitation of local actions.

AB  - Within the ground water community, the idea persists that if one can estimate the recharge to a ground water system, one then can determine the size of a sustainable development. Theis addressed this idea in 1940 and showed it to be wrong-yet the myth continues. The size of a sustainable ground water development usually depends on how much of the discharge from the system can be "captured" by the development. Capture is independent of the recharge, it depends on the dynamic response of the aquifer system to the development. Ground water models were created to study the response dynamics of ground water systems; it is one of the principal reasons hydrogeologists model.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to assess the nature and suitability of the natural resource base of a fragile environment for sustainable economic development. The situation is further complicated by the fact that groundwater conditions in the study area, the southeastern desert of Egypt, have been radically altered since the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Results show that soil conditions in the area will support both vegetation and crops over short periods of time, although further work is needed on long-term sustainability. There are three main sources of water in the area: surface water from Lake Nasser; shallow groundwater, associated with Lake Nasser; and ancient groundwater at depth in the Nubian sandstone. It is the former two which offer the most realistic development options. Vegetation resources offer opportunities for grazing, charcoal production and medicinal uses. The perceptions and attitudes of the local people of the area, as well as their livelihood patterns, make up a major element of the proposed development plan of the area.

AB  - Streamflow declines on the Great Plains of the US are causing many Federal reservoirs to become profoundly inefficient, and will eventually drive them into unsustainability as negative annual reservoir water budgets become more common. The streamflow declines are historically related to groundwater mining, but since the mid-1980s correlate increasingly with climate. This study highlights that progression toward unsustainability, and shows that future climate change wilt continue streamflow declines at historical rates, with severe consequences for surface water supply. An object lesson is Optima Lake in the Oklahoma Panhandle, where streamflows have declined 99% since the 1960s and the reservoir has never been more than 5% full. Water balances for the four westernmost Federal reservoirs in Kansas (Cedar Bluff, Keith Sebelius, Webster and Kirwin) show similar tendencies. For these four, reservoir inflow has declined by 92%, 73%, 81% and 64% respectively since the 1950s. Since 1990 total evaporated volumes relative to total inflows amounted to 68%, 83%, 24% and 44% respectively. Predictions of streamflow and reservoir performance based on climate change models indicate 70% chance of steady decline after 2007, with a similar to 50% chance of failure (releases by gravity flow impossible) of Cedar Bluff Reservoir between 2007 and 2050. Paradoxically, a 30% chance of storage increase prior 2020 is indicated, followed by steady declines through 2100. Within 95% confidence the models predict > 50% decline in surface water resources between 2007 and 2050. Ultimately, surface storage of water resources may prove unsustainable in this region, forcing conversion to subsurface storage. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The quantity and spatial distribution of groundwater in Croatia is determined by geological composition, climate and hydrological conditions and the hydrogeological characteristics of individual areas. Northern Croatia is part of the southern margin of the Pannonian basin and is dominated by the spacious lowlands of the Sava and Drava rivers, where aquifers of intergranular porosity of Pleistocene and Holocene ages were formed. The lithological composition of the aquifers is dominated by gravel and sand in the western parts of the Drava and Sava basins. Sandy aquifers are prevalent in the central and eastern parts. Groundwater accumulated in these aquifers is the basis of the water supply in northern Croatia, which is the reason why monitoring of its status, both quantitative and qualitative is exceptionally important. Data obtained by long-term monitoring of groundwater levels facilitated assessment of the quantitative status of groundwater. To determine the causes of changes in the hydrodynamic conditions of the aquifers, results of long-term monitoring of precipitation and stages of the Drava and Sava rivers were also used. Linear regression was used to analyse changes in groundwater levels, the Drava and Sava river stages and precipitation quantities. The results generally show that there is a negative groundwater level trend over almost the entire area of the Drava and Sava alluvial aquifer. This is a consequence of deepening of the Drava and Sava river beds and lowering of their stages, together with a decreasing trend of total annual precipitation.

AB  - In 2002 and 2003, Canada's International Development Research Centre, in partnership with other donors, organized four regional Forums to facilitate the exchange of information, results and lessons learned on water demand management (WDM) in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Over 500 decision-makers and water practitioners from II countries participated in Forums on wastewater reuse, water valuation, private-public partnerships, and decentralization. A large amount of valuable information on the above topics was gathered, and is available by entering www.idrc.ca/wadimena and clicking on WDM Forums. The WDM Forums demonstrated that water demand management is occurring in MENA, but without the breadth or strength that is required by the increasingly difficult water situation throughout the region. There is therefore great scope for further analytical work on water demand management and even greater scope for work on ways to promote its adoption in all nations and sectors. This review extracts lessons from the Forums, and suggests short- and long-term entry points for research and practice. The most striking conclusion is that in no MENA nation is WDM the main impetus for action. With wastewater the need to deal with growing volumes of sewage is the main force, and with the other three forums it is the need to reduce government budgets. Future work to promote water demand management in MENA must be oriented towards identifying and strengthening linkages to other water policies or programs, notably by distinguishing the role of WDM as a tool for greater water use efficiency from its role as a tool for greater water use equity. Equally important will be efforts to strengthen multi-stakeholder participation, transparency and accountability in policy-making processes and to promote dialogue with water-users, particularly women and the rural poor.

AB  - Understanding how plant functional traits shape nutrient limitation and cycling on land is a major challenge in ecology. This is especially true for lowland forest ecosystems of the tropics which can be taxonomically and functionally diverse and rich in bioavailable nitrogen (N). In many tropical regions, however, diverse forests occur side-by-side with monodominant forest (one species > 60% of canopy); the long-term biogeochemical consequences of tree monodominance are unclear. Particularly uncertain is whether the monodominant plant-soil system modifies nutrient balance at the ecosystem level. Here, we use chemical and stable isotope techniques to examine N cycling in old-growth Mora excelsa and diverse watershed rainforests on the island of Trinidad. Across 26 small watershed forests and 4 years, we show that Mora monodominance reduces bioavailable nitrate in the plant-soil system to exceedingly low levels which, in turn, results in small hydrologic and gaseous N losses at the watershed-level relative to adjacent N-rich diverse forests. Bioavailable N in soils and streams remained low and remarkably stable through time in Mora forests; N levels in diverse forests, on the other hand, showed high sensitivity to seasonal and inter-annual rainfall variation. Total mineral N losses from diverse forests exceeded inputs from atmospheric deposition, consistent with N saturation, while losses from Mora forests did not, suggesting N limitation. Our measures suggest that this difference cannot be explained by environmental factors but instead by low internal production and efficient retention of bioavailable N in the Mora plant-soil system. These results demonstrate ecosystem-level consequences of a tree species on the N cycle opposite to cases where trees enhance ecosystem N supply via N-2 fixation and suggest that, over time, Mora monodominance may generate progressive N draw-down in the plant-soil system.

AB  - Collaborative governance is on the rise in the United States. This management approach brings together state and non-state actors for environmental decision-making, and it is frequently used in California for decisions regarding local groundwater management. This study examines groundwater decision-making groups and practices in a central California coastal community to understand whether groups meet specific collaborative governance criteria and whether and why certain subsets of the population are excluded from groundwater decision-making practices. It also identifies actions for better group inclusion. We find that small farmers, the Hispanic/Latino community, and the general public are often excluded from groundwater decision-making groups and practices due to unawareness, mistrust, and insufficient resources. Education and awareness as well as incentives could help increase inclusion. This study provides insights into more equitable groundwater decision-making groups and practices, and also calls for more critical examination of the current stakeholder approach to decision-making.

AB  - Over 22 million hectares (ha) of U.S. croplands are irrigated. Irrigation is an intensified agricultural land use that increases crop yields and the practice affects water and energy cycles at, above, and below the land surface. Until recently, there has been a scarcity of geospatially detailed information about irrigation that is comprehensive, consistent, and timely to support studies tying agricultural land use change to aquifer water use and other factors. This study shows evidence for a recent overall net expansion of 522 thousand ha across the U.S. (2.33%) and 519 thousand ha (8.7%) in irrigated cropped area across the High Plains Aquifer (HPA) from 2002 to 2007. In fact, over 97% of the net national expansion in irrigated agriculture overlays the HPA. We employed a modeling approach implemented at two time intervals (2002 and 2007) for mapping irrigated agriculture across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS). We utilized U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) county statistics, satellite imagery, and a national land cover map in the model. The model output, called the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Irrigated Agriculture Dataset for the U.S. (MIrAD-US), was then used to reveal relatively detailed spatial patterns of irrigation change across the nation and the HPA. Causes for the irrigation increase in the HPA are complex, but factors include crop commodity price increases, the corn ethanol industry, and government policies related to water use. Impacts of more irrigation may include shifts in local and regional climate, further groundwater depletion, and increasing crop yields and farm income. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Water supply in semiarid Botswana is, to a large extent, based on groundwater. In the planning of a groundwater abstraction scheme, criteria for the sustainability of the abstraction with respect to both quantity and quality have to be satisfied. The most important parameter in the context of quantitative sustainability is the long-term average groundwater recharge together with its spatial distribution. A method is developed to calculate a recharge map that can be used in a groundwater model. The relative distribution of recharge is obtained from remotely sensed data and then calibrated with local values of recharge derived from the Chloride Method. The method was tested for two sites in Botswana, the Chobe Region and Ngamiland. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding how changes in the groundwater table affect surface water resources is of fundamental importance in quantitative hydrology. If the groundwater table below a stream is sufficiently deep, changes in the groundwater table position effectively do not alter the infiltration rate. This is referred to as a disconnected system. Previous authors noted that a low-conductivity layer below the surface water body is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for disconnection to occur. We develop a precise criterion that allows an assessment of whether surface water-groundwater systems can disconnect or not. We further demonstrate that a disconnected system can be conceptualized by a saturated groundwater mound and the development of a capillary zone above this mound. This conceptualization is used to determine the critical water table position at the point where full disconnection is reached. A comparison of this calculated critical water table position with a measurement of the water table depth in a borehole allows the assessment of the disconnection status. A sensitivity analysis of this critical water table showed that for a given aquifer thickness and river width, the depth to groundwater where the system disconnects is approximately proportional to the stream depth and the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed sediments and inversely proportional to the thickness of these sediments and the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. The conceptualization also allows the disconnection problem to be analyzed using both variably saturated and fully saturated groundwater models and provides guidance for numerical and analytical approaches.

AB  - Coastal aquifers provide a source of water for more than one billion people, with island freshwater lenses being some of the most vulnerable coastal groundwater systems due to their susceptibility to saltwater intrusion. Basic hydrogeological and hydrochemical knowledge regarding the recharge and salinisation processes of freshwater lenses is important to ensure sustainable utilisation, especially considering possible climate change effects. This paper makes an assessment of the fate of a freshwater lens in a drying climate through a comparison of current and historic hydrochemical data, which to the author's knowledge is unique to this study. Fresh groundwater stable isotope signatures (delta O-18, delta H-2) reflect local amount weighted rainfall signatures (delta O-18: -3.8 parts per thousand; delta H-2: -15.1 parts per thousand), and confirm rainfall as the origin of fresh groundwater (delta O-18: -4.47 to -3.82 parts per thousand; delta H-2: -20.0 to -16.6 parts per thousand). Mixing with seawater was identified through enriched groundwater delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures (maximum values of -0.36 parts per thousand and -1.4 parts per thousand respectively) compared to local rainfall and higher salinity (maximum 29,267 mg/L Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)) in a number of monitoring wells around the freshwater lens. Enhanced seawater intrusion detected in the northern section of the lens area was identified through significantly increased TDS values over the last 20-40 years, with increases of up to 3000% observed between 1990 and 2014. A reduction in the extent of freshwater by approximately 1 km(2) was identified since 1977, which was found to be primarily caused by a reduction in recharge to the freshwater lens due to a similar to 20% decline in winter rainfall in the south-west Western Australian region since the mid 1960s. Groundwater abstraction was found to equate to between 5% and 9% of the estimated recharge for the island, and is not a significant factor in the reduction of the lens extent compared to the observed decline in rainfall recharge. Interestingly, seawater intrusion into the fresh water lens was found to occur by older seawater (0.03-0.09 TU) in regions of the lens that were previously fresh or slightly brackish, while one sample (0.67 TU) suggests either modern seawater intrusion or mixing of older saline groundwaters (>60 years) with rainfall recharge. The use of tritium dating in this island aquifer was essential in identifying 'older' seawater that was previously unidentified until now. The isotopic and hydrochemical tools used in this paper quantify the effects of groundwater abstraction and climate variability on the freshwater lens and have implications for the sustainable management of the groundwater resource on Rottnest Island, and elsewhere.

AB  - Near-term consumption of groundwater for irrigated agriculture in the High Plains Aquifer supports a dynamic bio-socio-economic system, all parts of which will be impacted by a future transition to sustainable usage that matches natural recharge rates. Plants are the foundation of this system and so generic plant models suitable for coupling to representations of other component processes (hydrologic, economic, etc.) are key elements of needed stakeholder decision support systems. This study explores utilization of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to serve in this role. Calibration required many facilities of a fully deployed decision support system: geo-referenced databases of crop (corn, sorghum, alfalfa, and soybean), soil, weather, and water-use data (4931 well-years), interfacing heterogeneous software components, and massively parallel processing (3.8x10(9) model runs). Bootstrap probability distributions for ten model parameters were obtained for each crop by entropy maximization via the genetic algorithm. The relative errors in yield and water estimates based on the parameters are analyzed by crop, the level of aggregation (county- or well-level), and the degree of independence between the data set used for estimation and the data being predicted.

AB  - Policy for water resources impacts not only hydrological processes, but the closely intertwined economic and social processes dependent on them. Understanding these process interactions across domains is an important step in establishing effective and sustainable policy. Multidisciplinary integrated models can provide insight to inform this understanding, though the extent of software development necessary is often prohibitive, particularly for small teams of researchers. Thus there is a need for practical methods for building interdisciplinary integrated models that do not incur a substantial development effort. In this work we adopt the strategy of linking individual domain models together to build a multidisciplinary integrated model. The software development effort is minimized through the reuse of existing models and existing model-linking tools without requiring any changes to the model source codes, and linking these components through the use of the Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI). This was found to be an effective approach to building an agricultural-groundwater-economic integrated model for studying the effects of water policy in irrigated agricultural systems. The construction of the integrated model provided a means to evaluate the impacts of two alternative water-use policies aimed at reducing irrigated water use to sustainable levels in the semi-arid grasslands overlying the Ogallala Aquifer of the Central US. The results show how both the economic impact in terms of yield and revenue and the environmental impact in terms of groundwater level vary spatially throughout the study region for each policy. Accessible integration strategies are necessary if the practice of interdisciplinary integrated simulation is to become widely adopted.

AB  - Metropolitan Phoenix lacks a current, publicly accessible statement of its water supply front which to evaluate options for growth. This article presents research into the size and sustainability of the regional water supply. It introduces residential carrying capacity as an intuitive measure of the economic size of a water supply and examines entitlements, regulatory programs, and subsidies that constrain existing supplies from supporting new economic uses. The findings are (1) that the Phoenix renewable water supply is, in theory, sufficiently large to meet future regional economic goals and protect many environmental functions if the current context Of entitlements and institutional arrangements is ignored; and (2) that Phoenix needs to engineer new water supply policies instead of new water resources, to avoid large economic and environmental costs in the future.

AB  - Water level changes in wells provide a direct measure of the impact of groundwater development at a scale of relevance for management activities. Important information about aquifer dynamics and an aquifer's future is thus often embedded in hydrographs from continuously monitored wells. Interpretation of those hydrographs using methods developed for pumping-test analyses can provide insights that are difficult to obtain via other means. These insights are demonstrated at two sites in the High Plains aquifer in western Kansas. One site has thin unconfined and confined intervals separated by a thick aquitard. Pumping-induced responses in the unconfined interval indicate a closed (surrounded by units of relatively low permeability) system that is vulnerable to rapid depletion with continued development. Responses in the confined interval indicate that withdrawals are largely supported by leakage. Given the potential for rapid depletion of the unconfined interval, the probable source of that leakage, it is likely that large-scale irrigation withdrawals will not be sustainable in the confined interval beyond a decade. A second site has a relatively thick unconfined aquifer with responses that again indicate a closed system. However, unlike the first site, previously unrecognized vertical inflow can be discerned in data from the recovery periods. In years of relatively low withdrawals, this inflow can produce year-on-year increases in water levels, an unexpected occurrence in western Kansas. The prevalence of bounded-aquifer responses at both sites has important ramifications for modeling studies; transmissivity values from pumping tests, for example, must be used cautiously in regional models of such systems.

AB  - Temporary streams lack streamflow at some time in the seasonal cycle, and include ephemeral, intermittent and episodic streams. They often serve as headwaters for the perennial stream network in a drainage basin, and given that headwater streams can comprise the majority of the drainage network, temporary streams are significant hydrologic features across the country. Nevertheless, they have received relatively little attention compared to perennial streams. In addition, much previous work on temporary streams has focussed on semi-arid and arid landscapes where annual evapotranspiration exceeds annual precipitation. While such climatic conditions do control the occurrence of temporary streams in some regions in Canada, temporary streams can also occur in subhumid and humid climates. This paper examines the major controls on the occurrence and behaviour of temporary streams at the regional and reach scales in Canada; however, where necessary we also review literature from outside Canada on aspects of temporary streams relevant to the Canadian context. The paper assesses the temporal dynamics of temporary streams, along with key aspects of their geomorphology and ecology as well as current monitoring and modelling approaches. Temporary streams are very sensitive to anthropogenic and natural activities that can modify their hydrology and hydroecology, and they deserve greater attention from the Canadian hydrological community. Improved monitoring and process studies should be pursued in Canada.

AB  - To improve our understanding of the impacts of feedback between the atmosphere and the terrestrial water cycle including groundwater and to improve the integration of water resource management modelling for climate adaption we have developed a dynamically coupled climate-hydrological modelling system. The OpenMI modelling interface is used to couple a comprehensive hydrological modelling system, MIKE SHE running on personal computers, and a regional climate modelling system, HIRHAM running on a high performance computing platform. The coupled model enables two-way interaction between the atmosphere and the groundwater via the land surface and can represent the lateral movement of water in both the surface and subsurface and their interactions, not normally accounted for in climate models. Meso-scale processes are important for climate in general and rainfall in particular. Hydrological impacts are assessed at the catchment scale, the most important scale for water management. Feedback between groundwater, the land surface and the atmosphere occurs across a range of scales. Recognising this, the coupling was developed to allow dynamic exchange of water and energy at the catchment scale embedded within a larger meso-scale modelling domain. We present the coupling methodology used and describe the challenges in representing the exchanges between models and across scales. The coupled model is applied to one-way and two-way coupled simulations for a managed groundwater-dominated catchment, the Skjern River, Denmark. These coupled model simulations are evaluated against field observations and then compared with uncoupled climate and hydrological model simulations. Exploratory simulations show significant differences, particularly in the summer for precipitation and evapotranspiration the coupled model including groundwater and the RCM where groundwater is neglected. However, the resulting differences in the net precipitation and the catchment runoff in this groundwater dominated catchment were small. The need for further decadal scale simulations to understand the differences and insensitivity is highlighted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - River basin modeling under complexity requires analytical frameworks capable of dealing with the multiple scales and dimensions of environmental problems as well as uncertainty in the evolution of social systems. Conceptual and methodological developments can now be framed using the wide socio-eco-hydrological approach. We add hierarchy theory into the mix to discuss the conceptualization of river basins as complex, holarchic social-ecological systems. We operationalize the social-ecological systems water metabolism framework in a semiarid watershed in Spain, and add the governance dimension that shapes human-environment reciprocity. To this purpose, we integrate an eco-hydrological model with the societal metabolism accounting scheme for land use, human activity, and water use. We explore four types of interactions: between societal organization and water uses/demands, between ecosystem organization and their water requirements/supplies, between societal metabolism and aquatic ecosystem health, and between water demand and availability. Our results reveal a metabolic pattern of a high mountain rural system striving to face exodus and agricultural land abandonment with a multifunctional economy. Centuries of social-ecological evolution shaping waterscapes through traditional water management practices have influenced the eco-hydrological functioning of the basin, enabling adaptation to aridity. We found a marked spatial gradient on water supply, use pattern, and impact on water bodies from the head to the mouth of the basin. Management challenges posed by the European water regulatory framework as a new driver of social-ecological change are highlighted.

AB  - Human activities have resulted in increased nutrient levels in many rivers all over Europe. Sustainable management of river basins demands an assessment of the causes and consequences of human alteration of nutrient flows, together with an evaluation of management options. In the context of an integrated and interdisciplinary environmental assessment (IEA) of nutrient flows, we present and discuss the application of the nutrient emission model MONERIS (MOdelling Nutrient Emissions into River Systems) to the Catalan river basin, La Tordera (north-east Spain), for the period 1996-2002. After a successful calibration and verification process (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies E = 0.85 for phosphorus and E = 0.86 for nitrogen), the application of the model MONERIS proved to be useful in estimating nutrient loads. Crucial for model calibration, in-stream retention was estimated to be about 50% of nutrient emissions on an annual basis. Through this process, we identified the importance of point sources for phosphorus emissions (about 94% for 1996-2002), and diffuse sources, especially inputs via groundwater, for nitrogen emissions (about 31% for 1996-2002). Despite hurdles related to model structure, observed loads, and input data encountered during the modelling process, MONERIS provided a good representation of the major interannual and spatial patterns in nutrient emissions. An analysis of the model uncertainty and sensitivity to input data indicates that the model MONERIS, even in data-starved Mediterranean catchments, may be profitably used by water managers for evaluating quantitative nutrient emission scenarios for the purpose of managing river basins. As an example of scenario modelling, an analysis of the changes in nutrient emissions through two different future scenarios allowed the identification of a set of relevant measures to reduce nutrient loads.

AB  - Hydrological and silvicultural studies carried out in southern India on the effects of plantations of Eucalyptus and other fast growing exotic tree species have determined the impacts of these plantations on water resources, erosion, soil nutrient status and growth rates at sites of differing rainfall and soil depth in Karnataka. Whilst providing new information on these issues, the studies also raised two important questions: what was the explanation for the anomalous result that the water use of 3400 mm from Eucalyptus plantations at Hosakote over a three year period exceeded the rainfall of 2100 mm over the same period and why were growth rates of woodlots on most farmer's fields higher than those of plantations on land owned by the Karnataka Forest Department? The records of the soil moisture depletion patterns under these plantations from the day of planting provide the basis for the answers to both questions: i) whilst roots are penetrating into deeper soil layers, they are able to extract from a reservoir of water additional to that available from the rainfall each year, ii) farmer's land on which short rooted agricultural crops have been grown previously is likely to have a much higher soil water status than land previously under forest or scrub vegetation. These new studies have also established that the development of the drying front under the Eucalyptus camaldulensis plantations is very rapid, indicating average root extension rates in excess of 2.5 m per year, whilst those under Tectona grandis and Artocarpus heterophyllus advanced at approximately half the rate. These results have obvious implications for the long term sustainability of growth rates from these plantations and the recharge of groundwater. The authors believe that this study may be the first to report neutron probe soil moisture depletion observations, from the date of planting, beneath tree plantations in a dry climate. The extent to which the roots were able to penetrate raises the question of whether other studies, which have estimated water use from soil moisture observations in dry climates, may have seriously underestimated both the actual soil moisture depletion and the water use through having soil moisture measurements located to insufficient depth.

AB  - Groundwater management scenarios for the Toluca Valley, Mexico, are examined with a three dimensional groundwater flow model coupled to a one dimensional compaction module. The objective of this study is to establish a management policy for the sustainable development and management of the Toluca aquifer system for minimizing land subsidence. Several scenarios are tested by varying 4 main parameters: recharge, exports to other basins, local consumption, and relocating pumping centers. It is apparent that continuing at current rates of water consumption will lead to subsidence of more than 1.6 m over a 40 year period (2010-2050). Completely stopping exports to Mexico City is not the most important factor in controlling subsidence because the pumping system is mostly located in regions with low clay content, where subsidence is lower. However, decreasing exports by half and relocating the pumping centres to low-clay-content areas does have a positive effect on the overall water budget and subsidence. Based on simulation results, it appears that much of the land subsidence could have been avoided had water policies been applied to restrict pumping in regions with compressible materials. The approach taken in this study could be applied to other locations with similar problems in order to determine the most viable option for water supply.

AB  - Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater resources - around 70 percent of all freshwater withdrawals are used for food production. These agricultural products are traded internationally. A full understanding of water use is, therefore, impossible without understanding the international market for food and related products, such as textiles. Based on the global general equilibrium model GTAP-W, we offer a method for investigating the role of green (rain) and blue (irrigation) water resources in agriculture and within the context of international trade. We use future projections of allowable water withdrawals for surface water and groundwater to define two alternative water management scenarios. The first scenario explores a deterioration of current trends and policies in the water sector (water crisis scenario). The second scenario assumes an improvement in policies and trends in the water sector and eliminates groundwater overdraft world-wide, increasing water allocation for the environment (sustainable water use scenario). In both scenarios, welfare gains or losses are not only associated with changes in agricultural water consumption. Under the water crisis scenario, welfare not only rises for regions where water consumption increases (China, South East Asia and the USA). Welfare gains are considerable for Japan and South Korea, Southeast Asia and Western Europe as well. These regions benefit from higher levels of irrigated production and lower food prices. Alternatively, under the sustainable water use scenario, welfare losses not only affect regions where overdrafting is occurring. Welfare decreases in other regions as well. These results indicate that, for water use, there is a clear trade-off between economic welfare and environmental sustainability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land subsidence caused by extensive groundwater pumping has become a factor which cannot be ignored in the sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources. The Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Plain is one of the locations with China's most severe land subsidence problems; the region has experienced dramatic land subsidence since the 1960s. Historical records of groundwater extraction, hydraulic head, and land subsidence show the latter to be the result of continual and excessive extraction of groundwater from deep confined aquifers. This study reconstructs land subsidence using an integrated regional groundwater flow and land subsidence model. The model is calibrated using land subsidence and groundwater level measurements from 1996 to 2007. Simulation results reproduce the cones of depression for groundwater heads and nadirs of land subsidence reasonably well. The calibrated model is used to evaluate the efficacy of land subsidence prevention plans from 2008 to 2010, and to predict future land subsidence over the next decade considering several groundwater exploitation scenarios. The results show the main cause of land subsidence to be inelastic compaction of the aquifer system resulting from continuously declining water levels. The model reveals that while the area of land subsidence will continue to extend, the rate of this extension may be significantly decreased by reduction of groundwater extraction. If the current land subsidence prevention and reclamation plans are continued and surface water diversion projects implemented, though land subsidence cannot be halted, the rate at which it is occurring can be effectively reduced.

AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) is one of the global hotspots of groundwater depletion. Currently, our understanding is limited on spatiotemporal variability in depletion and approaches toward more sustainable groundwater development in this region. This study was intended to simulate spatiotemporal variability in groundwater depletion across the entire NCP and explore approaches to reduce future depletion. Simulated predevelopment groundwater recharge (similar to 13 km(3)/yr) primarily discharged as base flow to rivers and evapotranspiration. Initial groundwater storage was estimated to be 1500 km(3) of drainable storage in shallow aquifers and 40 km(3) of compressive storage in deep aquifers. Simulated groundwater depletion from 1960s to 2008 averaged similar to 4 km(3)/yr. Cumulative depletion was 50 km(3) (similar to 20% of pumpage) in the piedmont district, 103 km(3) (similar to 20%) in the central plain, and 5 km(3) (12%) in the coastal plain. However, depletion varied with time: similar to 2.5 km(3)/yr in the 1970s, similar to 4.0 in the 1980s, similar to 2.0 in 1990-1996; similar to 7.0 in 1997-2001, and similar to 4.0 in 2002-2008. Recharge also varied spatially, averaging similar to 120 mm/yr and concentrated in the piedmont district (200-350 mm/yr) while lower in the central and coastal plains (50-100 mm/yr). Simulation of several alternatives, including managed aquifer recharge, increased water use efficiency, brackish water use, and interbasin water transfer, indicated that the combination of these strategies could be used to recover groundwater storage by 50 km(3) over a 15-year period. This study provides valuable insights for developing more sustainable groundwater management options for the NCP; the methods are useful for managing other depleted aquifers. Citation: Cao, G., C.

AB  - Environmental stable and radioactive isotopes (delta H-2, delta C-13, delta O-18; H-3 and C-14), together with physical and geochemical data, were used in the determination of the origins of groundwater salinization and geochemical evolution processes in coastal regions. Two case studies on the Atlantic Coast are discussed, one located in the Essaouira sedimentary basin, western Morocco, and the second, in the Lower Tagus-Sado sedimentary basin, southwest Portugal. In both regions, groundwater degradation occurs by salinization increase to different concentrations and in relation to different origins. The main quality issues for the groundwater resources are related to seawater intrusion, dissolution of diapiric structures intruding the aquifer layers, brine dissolution at depth, and/or evaporation of irrigation water. Anthropogenic pollution ascribed to agricultural activities is another source for groundwater degradation, affecting mainly the shallow aquifers. The apparent C-14 age of the analysed samples ranges from 2.9 +/- 0.3 up to 45.6 +/- 0.6 pmC in the Miocene groundwater samples from the basin in Portugal; at the Essaouira basin in Morocco, the C-14 content varies from 60 to 86 pmC. In most of the water samples, the H-3 concentration is below the detection limit. In both basins, the isotopic results together with the geochemical data provided an effective label for tracing the mineralization origin and groundwater degradation processes. Further, the isotopic signatures were used in the identification of a paleoclimate (colder period), recorded in the stable isotopic composition and corroborated with the C-14 data.

AB  - Water management policies and their impacts for both the Basin of Mexico and the Lerma-Chapala basinwhere nearly 25% of Mexico's inhabitants are foundare described. This work shows that the prevailing water management policy has been the augmentation of water supply and neither policies have focused on water savings nor management of water demand. The effects of the large extraction rates on both basins have caused drying-up of streams due to drawdown rates that reach 2.5m/year with an associated land subsidence in different cities in these basins. Water management in Mexico needs to change from a water supply approach to a water efficiency approach, where water needs to be efficiently used. Water management will only improve when policies consider both technical and social perspectives. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The city of Quer,taro, located near the political boundary of the Mexican states of Quer,taro and Guanajuato, relies on groundwater as it sole water supply. Groundwater extraction in the city increased from 21 Au 10(6) m(3)/yr in 1970 to 104 Au 10(6) m(3)/yr in 2010, with an associated drawdown of 100 m in some parts of the aquifer. A three-dimensional numerical groundwater-flow model has been developed that represents the historical evolution of the aquifer's potentiometric levels and is used to simulate the effect of two scenarios: (1) a 40 % reduction in the extraction rate from public water supply wells in early 2011 (thus reducing the extraction to 62 Au 10(6) m(3)/yr), and (2) a further reduction in 2021 to 1 Au 10(6) m(3)/yr. The modeling results project a temporary recovery of the potentiometric levels after the 40 % reduction of early 2011, but a return to 2010 levels by 2020. If scenario 2 is implemented in 2021, the aquifer will take nearly 30 years to recover to the simulated levels of 1995. The model also shows that the wells located in the city of Quer,taro started to extract water from part of the aquifer beneath the State of Guanajuato in the late 1970s, thus showing that the administrative boundaries used in Mexico to study and develop water resources are inappropriate, and consideration should be given to physical boundaries instead. A regional approach to studying aquifers is needed in order to adequately understand groundwater flow dynamics.

AB  - Numerical experiments were developed using different water table depths and soil textures to investigate the impact of aspen harvesting on hydrological processes on the Western Boreal Plain. The effect of harvesting on soil moisture dynamics, fluxes at the water table, and water table fluctuation were compared for different harvesting scenarios simulated under wet and dry climatic cycles. Strong interaction between shallow water tables (i.e., 2 m) and atmospheric variability is observed for all soil textures and is reduced as the vadose zone thickens, particularly after a dry cycle, as a series of positive net atmospheric fluxes are needed to reduce soil moisture storage in order for recharge to occur. Because of harvesting, the water table fluxes can increase by 50 mm month(-1), while on a yearly basis, this increase can reach 200 mm yr(-1), with rainfall events taking between 1 and 5 years to become recharge (i.e., time lag). Also, the water table is expected to rise between 1 and 3.5 m, with rainfall-water table rise time lags of 1-3 years; however, the peak manifestation of harvesting on water table elevation can take up to 7 years after harvesting. The effects of aspen harvesting are more pronounced during wet cycles, and the development of forestry activities in the Boreal Plain should consider not only preceding precipitation but also the preceding precipitation-reference evapotranspiration ratio, water table depth, and soil texture. The interaction of these factors needs to be considered in order to develop sustainable forestry plans and avoid waterlogging conditions.

AB  - Documenting the location and magnitude of groundwater recharge is critical for understanding groundwater flow systems. Radioactive tracers, notably C-14, H-3, Cl-36, and the noble gases, together with other tracers whose concentrations vary over time, such as the chlorofluorocarbons or sulfur hexafluoride, are commonly used to estimate recharge rates. This review discusses some of the advantages and problems of using these tracers to estimate recharge rates. The suite of tracers allows recharge to be estimated over timescales ranging from a few years to several hundred thousand years, which allows both,the long-term and modern behaviour of groundwater systems to be documented. All tracers record mean residence times and mean recharge rates rather than a specific age and date of recharge. The timescale over which recharge rates are averaged increases with the mean residence time. This is an advantage in providing representative recharge rates but presents a problem in comparing recharge rates derived from these tracers with those from other techniques, such as water table fluctuations or lysimeters. In addition to issues relating to the sampling and interpretation of specific tracers, macroscopic dispersion and mixing in groundwater flow systems limit how precisely groundwater residence times and recharge rates may be estimated. Additionally, many recharge studies have utilised existing infrastructure that may not be ideal for this purpose (e.g., wells with long screens that sample groundwater several kilometres from the recharge area). Ideal recharge studies would collect sufficient information to optimise the use of specific tracers and minimise the problems of mixing and dispersion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A detailed study using environmental tracers such as chloride (Cl-) and tritium (H-3), deuterium (H-2) and oxygen (O-18) isotopes was performed in an alluvial coastal aquifer in two contrasting environments (urban and agricultural). These environmental tracers combined with a high-resolution multi-level sampling approach were used to estimate groundwater residence time and recharge patterns and to validate the hydrogeochemical conceptual model already proposed in previous studies. delta O-18 and delta H-2 combined with Cl- data proved that the hypersaline groundwater present in the deepest part of the aquifer was sourced from the underlying hypersaline aquitard via an upward flux. Both chemical and isotopic data were employed to calibrate a density-dependent numerical model based on SEAWAT 4.0, where H-3 and Cl- were helped quantifying solutes transport within the modelled aquifer. Model results highlighted the differences on estimated recharge in the two contrasting environments, with the urban one exhibiting concentrated recharge because of preferential infiltration associated to the storm water drains network, while scarce local recharge characterized the agriculture setting. In the urban field site, is still possible to recognize at 9m b.g.l. the input of the atmospheric anthropogenic H-3 generated by testing of thermonuclear weapons, while in the agricultural field site, the H-3 peak has been washed out at 6m b.g.l. because the groundwater circulation is restricted only to the upper fresh part of the aquifer, drained by the reclamation system. The presented approach that combined high-resolution field monitoring, environmental tracers and numerical modelling, resulted effective in validating the conceptual model of the aquifer salinization.

AB  - Evaluating the sustainability of water uses in shallow aquifers is fundamental for both environmental and socio-economic reasons. Groundwater models are the main tools to sustain informed management plans, yet simulation results are affected by both epistemic and parametric uncertainties. In this study, we aim at investigating the effect of model uncertainties on three assessment criteria: depth to water (DTW), recharge/discharge analysis and a newly defined sustainability index S. We consider, as a case study, the shallow aquifer of the Adige Valley, which is highly influenced by surface water dynamics, water withdrawals from pumping wells and a dense network of ditches. Both direct measurements and soft data are used to reduce uncertainty associated to the limited knowledge about the spatial distribution of the hydraulic parameters. Simulation results showed that the aquifer is chiefly influenced by the interaction with the Adige River and that the influence of anthropogenic activities on vulnerability of groundwater resources varies within the study area. This calls for differentiated approaches to water resources management. Uncertainty related to the three assessment criteria is chiefly controlled by uncertainty of the hydrogeological model, although it depends also on the strategy adopted for the management of water resources.

AB  - The playa-lakes of the Monegros desert in north-east Spain are saline wetlands in an arid environment, a rare phenomenon in Europe. These extremely valuable habitats are threatened by changes associated with agricultural expansion and incorporation of new irrigated areas. An understanding of the present hydrologic regime will enable changes to be identified, particularly those brought about by flooding and pollution caused by irrigation surplus. This study sets out to show the results of applying a daily water balance in three selected playa-lakes. The balance was in two parts and consisted of: (1) the average balance for all the endorheic basin using the BALAN_11 program, and (2) the water balance in some playa-lakes, applying discharge flows obtained from the previous balance. The resulting volumes of water were converted to water depths and contrasted with reference volumes taken from field and Landsat images. The model was calibrated by applying various hypotheses of function which enabled the results to be adjusted. The proposed balance is an acceptable reproduction of field water measurements during this period, and underlines the consistency of the conceptual model. The methodology used is appropriate for understanding the playa-lakes function and for monitoring them for conservation purposes.

AB  - Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park is one of Spain's most representative groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Under natural conditions, water inflows combined brackish surface water from River Giguela with freshwater inputs from River Guadiana and the underlying aquifer. Since the mid-1970s, aquifer overexploitation caused the desiccation of the wetlands and neighbouring springs. The National Park remained in precarious hydrological conditions for three decades, with the only exception of rapid floods due to extreme rainfall events and sporadic water transfers from other basins. In the late 2000s, a decrease in groundwater abstraction and an extraordinarily wet period reversed the trend. The aquifer experienced an unexpected recovery of groundwater levels (over 20m in some areas), thus restoring groundwater discharge to springs and wetlands. The complex historical evolution of the water balance in this site has resulted in substantial changes in surface and groundwater quality. This becomes evident when comparing the pre-1980 groundwater quality and the hydrochemical status in the wetland in two different periods, under dry and wet conditions. Although the system is close to full recovery from the groundwater-level viewpoint, bouncing back in the major hydrochemical constituents has not yet been obtained. These still appear to evolve in response to the previous overexploitation state. Moreover, in some sectors, there are groundwater-dependent ecosystems that remain different to those found in preoverexploitation times. The experience of Las Tablas de Damiel provides an observatory of long-term changes in wetland water quality, demonstrating that the effects of aquifer overexploitation on aquatic ecosystems are more than a mere alteration of the water balance and that groundwater quality is the key to aquifer and aquatic ecosystem sustainability.

AB  - Among the difficulties and uncertainties that arise when determining water balance is the calculation of groundwater abstraction. This factor is particularly important in aquifers whose extension and heavy agricultural use make direct quantification methods unfeasible (i.e. flow meters and power consumption data). This study presents a method of quantifying groundwater abstractions for irrigation based on the analysis of multitemporal and multispectral satellite images. The process begins with a highly detailed classification of irrigated crops; these data are entered in a Geographic Information System, overlain with a correct estimate of the irrigation requirements of the crop, and corrected in accordance with the agricultural practices of the area. The results reveal the spatial and temporal distribution of the groundwater volume abstracted and used for agriculture. This methodology has been applied in the Mancha Oriental Hydrogeological System (Spain, 7,260 km(2)), where abstractions for agriculture comprise more than 90% of the hydrological resources consumed. In this context, accuracies of over 95% have been obtained with a cost sixty times lower than that of traditional methods.

AB  - Groundwater is critical to global food security, environmental flows, and millions of rural livelihoods in the face of climate change. Although a third of Earth's largest groundwater basins are being depleted by irrigated agriculture, little is known about the conditions that lead resource users to comply with conservation policies. Here we developed an agent-based model of irrigated agriculture rooted in principles of cooperation and collective action and grounded on the World Values Survey Wave 6 (n = 90,350). Simulations of three major aquifer systems facing unsustainable demands reveal tipping points where social norms towards groundwater conservation shift abruptly with small changes in cultural values and monitoring and enforcement provisions. These tipping points are amplified by group size and best invoked by engaging a minority of rule followers. Overall, we present a powerful tool for evaluating the contingency of regulatory compliance upon cultural, socioeconomic, institutional and physical conditions, and its susceptibility to change beyond thresholds. Managing these thresholds may help to avoid unsustainable groundwater development, reduce enforcement costs, better account for cultural diversity in transboundary aquifer management and increase community resilience to changes in regional climate. Although we focus on groundwater, our methods and findings apply broadly to other resource management issues.

AB  - Quantifying the impact of land use on water supply and quality is a primary focus of environmental management. In this work we apply a semidistributed hydrological model (SWAT) to predict the impact of different land management practices on water and agricultural chemical yield over a long period of time for a study site situated in the Arborea region of central Sardinia, Italy. The physical processes associated with water movement, crop growth, and nutrient cycling are directly modeled by SWAT. The model simulations are used to identify indicators that reflect critical processes related to the integrity and sustainability of the ecosystem. Specifically we focus on stream quality and quantity indicators associated with anthropogenic and natural sources of pollution. A multicriteria decision support system is then used to develop the analysis matrix where water quality and quantity indicators for the rivers, lagoons, and soil are combined with socio-economic variables. The DSS is used to assess four options involving alternative watersheds designated for intensive agriculture and dairy farming and the use or not of treated wastewater for irrigation. Our analysis suggests that of the four options, the most widely acceptable consists in the transfer of intensive agricultural practices to the larger watershed, which is less vulnerable, in tandem with wastewater reuse, which rates highly due to water scarcity in this region of the Mediterranean. More generally, the work demonstrates how both qualitative and quantitative methods and information can assist decision making in complex settings.

AB  - The continuous abstraction of groundwater from Arusha aquifers in northern Tanzania has resulted in a decline in water levels and subsequent yield reduction in most production wells. The situation is threatening sustainability of the aquifers and concise knowledge on the existing groundwater challenge is of utmost importance. To gain such knowledge, stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, and radiocarbon dating on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), were employed to establish groundwater mean residence time and recharge mechanism. C-14 activity of DIC was measured in groundwater samples and corrected using a delta C-13 mixing method prior to groundwater age dating. The results indicated that groundwater ranging from 1,400 years BP to modern is being abstracted from deeper aquifers that are under intensive development. This implies that the groundwater system is continuously depleted due to over-pumping, as most of the sampled wells and springs revealed recently recharged groundwater. High C-14 activities observed in spring water (98.1 +/- 7.9 pMC) correspond with modern groundwater in the study area. The presence of modern groundwater suggests that shallow aquifers are actively recharged and respond positively to seasonal variations.

AB  - Arusha aquifers have been exploited intensively serving as the main source of domestic water supply in the city. But the quality of groundwater is not clearly documented for future planning and management. Hydrogeochemical assessment was carried out to establish groundwater quality and its spatial distribution with the aid of geostatistical techniques. Groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for major cations and anions using conventional methods of water analysis. Well lithology and geological map were considered for hydrogeological interpretation of the area. The results of piper diagram revealed Na-K-HCO3 water type with sodium and bicarbonate ions dominating in all samples. High fluoride concentrations and general groundwater chemistry are mainly controlled by aquifer lithology than anthropogenic activities. The levels of anthropogenic pollution indicators such as nitrate, chloride and sulfate in deep wells are generally low and most likely coming from natural sources. The geological sections indicate two potential aquifers (volcanic sediment and weathered/fractured formation) both yield water containing significant concentration of fluoride. Fluoride concentrations were higher than WHO guidelines (1.5 mg/l) and Tanzanian standards (4.0 mg/l) by 82 and 36% of the analyzed groundwater samples, respectively. The southern part of the study area yields groundwater of better quality for human consumption than northern zones which is at high elevation on the foot of Mt. Meru. With exception of fluoride, the quality of groundwater in the study area is generally suitable for drinking purpose and other socioeconomic uses.

AB  - The coastal aquifer of Ghis-Nekor (Morocco) was studied to identify the major processes causing salinization of groundwater. In fact, a geochemical approach multi tracer (general chemistry and isotopes delta H-2, delta O-18-(H2O), delta S-34 delta O-18-(SO4)) was utilized, with the hydrodynamics to explain the processes responsible for the salinization of groundwater, and for identttifying areas most vulnerable to seawater intrusion. The recharge of the aquifer is mainly by the Al-Khattabi dam, the Nekor River and the Ghis River, on the eastern border of the plain. The water that feeds the aquifer shows a relatively high level of salinity and for this reason, the majority of sampled wells indicate high values of electric conductivity and total salinity which arrives at 7.5 g L-1. The plot of the geochemical results analyzes of groundwater in the Piper diagram shows two distinct chemical facies; sodium chloride-facies and chlorinated calcium and magnesium sulfated facies. The concentrations of O-18 range between -4.15 parts per thousand and -5.73 parts per thousand, while the values of H-2 range between -28.4 parts per thousand and -41.7 parts per thousand. The Nekor river water is depleted in heavy isotopes, and the isotopic compositions are in the order on -6 parts per thousand for O-18 and -40.5 parts per thousand for deuterium. Most of the wells have a slope <8 indicating a slight evaporation before infiltration. The data show low and variable d-excess values (range from -0.02 parts per thousand to -11.6 parts per thousand), reflect recharge during different climatic conditions. The isotopic concentrations of O-18-SO4 vary between 4.35 parts per thousand and 8.60 parts per thousand, while the S-34 isotope values range from -4.3 parts per thousand to 9.9 parts per thousand. For Ghis River, these values are between -4.4 parts per thousand and 4.95 parts per thousand, respectively, for sulfur and oxygen. The interpretation of the chemical and isotopic results suggesting the intrusion of seawater to increase salinity of groundwater in the region is low. However, only the NE area shows probable contamination of seawater. In contrast, wells are saline independent of seawater intrusion, the origin of the high salinity can be related to: 1- the accumulation of rivers fluid intake and water dam rich dissolved salts and sulphates, 2- the anthropogenic pollution (domestic sewage, agricultural inputs, septic uses).

AB  - A risk assessment tool for contaminated sites in low-permeability fractured media is developed, based on simple transient and steady-state analytical solutions. The discrete fracture (DF) tool, which explicitly accounts for the transport along fractures, covers different source geometries and history (including secondary sources) and can be applied to a wide range of compounds. The tool successfully simulates published data from short duration column and field experiments. The use for risk assessment is illustrated by three typical risk assessment case studies, involving pesticides, chlorinated solvents, benzene and MTBE. The model is compared with field data and with results from a simpler approach based on an Equivalent Porous Media (EPM). Risk assessment conclusions of the DF and EPM approaches are very different due to the early breakthrough, long term tailing, and lower attenuation due to degradation associated with fractured media. While the DF tool simulates the field data, it is difficult to conclude that the DF model is superior to an EPM model because of a lack of long term monitoring data. However, better agreement with existing field data by the DF model using observed physical fracture parameters favors the use of this model over the EPM model for risk assessments.

AB  - Groundwater systems are intrinsically heterogeneous with dynamic temporal-spatial patterns, which cause great difficulty in quantifying their complex processes, while reliable predictions of regional groundwater levels are commonly needed for managing water resources to ensure proper service of water demands within a region. In this study, we proposed a novel and flexible soft-computing technique that could effectively extract the complex high-dimensional input-output patterns of basin-wide groundwater-aquifer systems in an adaptive manner. The soft-computing models combined the Self Organized Map (SOM) and the Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) network for predicting monthly regional groundwater levels based on hydrologic forcing data. The SOM could effectively classify the temporal-spatial patterns of regional groundwater levels, the NARX could accurately predict the mean of regional groundwater levels for adjusting the selected SUM, the Kriging was used to interpolate the predictions of the adjusted SOM into finer grids of locations, and consequently the prediction of a monthly regional groundwater level map could be obtained. The Zhuoshui River basin in Taiwan was the study case, and its monthly data sets collected from 203 groundwater stations, 32 rainfall stations and 6 flow stations during 2000 and 2013 were used for modelling purpose. The results demonstrated that the hybrid SOM-NARX model could reliably and suitably predict monthly basin-wide groundwater levels with high correlations (R-2 > 0.9 in both training and testing cases). The proposed methodology presents a milestone in modelling regional environmental issues and offers an insightful and promising way to predict monthly basin-wide groundwater levels, which is beneficial to authorities for sustainable water resources management.

AB  - Water has its own special characteristics, whether visible and flowing on the surface or invisible underground as groundwater. Owing to its mobility, water cannot be easily possessed; without it human survival and the living environment as we know it would not be possible. In European countries and their former colonies, including the Americas, water rights have their origins both in civil law from the European continent and in the common law of England. Both traditions viewed groundwater as the property of the owner of the land above it, who could use it as he pleased, irrespective of any impact to his neighbours. As long as abstractions remained small, questions of sustainability and impact to others and the environment did not arise. Technological progress in the last century caused an explosion in the quantities of groundwater abstracted. It was soon recognized that groundwater, even when renewable, is not inexhaustible and that its overexploitation can lead to unacceptable impacts. In the same period, intensive agriculture, urban expansion and industrial development led to the pollution of groundwaters in many countries. Impacts on both quantity and quality prompted legislative changes worldwide. Modern legislation has sought to control abstraction by introducing a system of permits or licences granted and regulated by the state, and to protect aquifers from pollution by introducing water quality standards and environmental regulations.

AB  - In the catchment area of Scopia, Central Greece, a lumped applied approach of water balance was accomplished, by applying the Zygos model, which delineates an essential water balance forms. The model is in view of Thornthwaite model, in its modified version. It can be adjusted automatically, with the evolutionary annealing-simplex technique for nonlinear optimization, or manually and the input data are precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration. In the present study, both programmed and manual calibration occurred. Programmed calibration took place, utilizing a specimen of measured runoff values from October 2009 to March 2011. Despite the fact that the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC) value was high (0.87), the simulated parameters of water balance had abnormal significance for Scopia catchment area. On the contrary, manual calibration uncovered that the actual evapotranspiration constitutes 64.6% (450.1 mm) of the precipitation. Runoff and percolation represent 20.6% (143.6 mm) and 14.8% (102.9 mm) of the precipitation, respectively. The NSC (0.70) and the validation criteria exhibit an ideal adjustment of simulated to measured runoff, while the hydrological parameters appeared to have a physical significance for the study site. Zygos model connects the emergence of springs with the development of the karstification in the carbonate rocks of the region and affirms the predominance of runoff versus percolation due to the hydrolithological structure of the Scopia catchment. This is related to the presence of episodic floods in the area. The yearly precipitation values were found with an error of 0.2% and are viewed as insignificant.

AB  - The aim of the study is to establish an hydrogeological scheme of the structure and the functioning of andesitic volcanic systems in the insular and humid tropical context. A watershed has been instrumented at Fefe in Guadeloupe (French West Indies) in the Lesser Antilles to measure rainfall, runoff and piezometric fluctuations between 2003 and 2006. Given the heterogeneity of the volcanic deposits, a multidisciplinary approach has been used: a geological and an hydrogeological survey, an hydrodynamic approach (hydraulic tests and signal processing of hydrological time series), and finally, an hydrogeochemical approach (major elements and some trace elements). Two main superposed aquifer respectively in aerial deposits, and in recent nuees ardentes (glowing ash) and lava flows, as well as the underlying aquiclude (the highly weathered older substratum) were identified. At a local scale, some hydrogeological heterogeneities internal to the aquifers were highlighted and related to a polyphased building-up of the geological formations. Hydraulic relationships between the multi-layered aquifers, such as the confinement of the deep aquifer upstream of the basin, were identified. Groundwater/stream exchanges were characterised, detailing various contributions of the shallow and the deep aquifers to stream and spring waters; significant river losses were also observed. At a global scale, within such relatively permeable volcanic formations, the aquifer recharge is about 85% of the annual effective rainfall for an average rainfall year. The hydrogeological scheme appears to be coherent with a geological structure of cut-and-fill paleovalleys frequently observed in andesitic areas. Consequently, groundwater drainage axis are mainly localised in recent nuees ardentes deposits, whereas the inversion of relief characteristic of volcanic areas explains the non-superposition of surface water and groundwater divides and both surface water losses and springs. Finally, this work shows the highly heterogeneous hydrogeological processes occurring in volcanic formations of andesitic-type. It also shows the relationships between the geological structure and the hydrogeological functioning of such basins, and proposes an affordable methodological approach to investigate such a hydrogeological context in depth.

AB  - Dynamic groundwater resources of India have been estimated using groundwater resource estimation methodology-1997. The methodology uses the water-level fluctuation technique and empirical norms for recharge estimation. The groundwater utilization is also estimated. The stage of groundwater development is worked out and assessment units are categorized based on the stage of groundwater development and long-term water-level trend. The annual replenishable groundwater resources of India is 433 billion cubic metre (bcm) and net annual groundwater availability is 399 bcm. The annual groundwater draft for 2004 was 231 bcm. Thus the overall stage of groundwater development is 58%. Out of 5723 assessment units in the country, 4078 are 'safe' and 839 are 'over-exploited'. The rest fall under 'semi-critical' and 'critical' category. Over-exploitation is more prevalent in northwestern, western and Peninsular India. Eastern India has good potential for future groundwater development. Considering the changing groundwater scenario, re-assessment of groundwater resources needs to be carried out at regular intervals. This would require further strengthening of the available database.

AB  - This study develops an optimization model for the large-scale conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources. The aim is to maximize public and irrigation water supplies subject to groundwater-level drawdown constraints. Linear programming is used to create the optimization model, which is formulated as a linear constrained objective function. An artificial neural network is trained by a flow modeling program at specific observation wells, and the network is then incorporated into the optimization model. The proposed methodology is applied to the Chou-Shui alluvial fan system, located in central Taiwan. People living in this region rely on large quantities of pumped water for their public and irrigation demands. This considerable dependency on groundwater has resulted in severe land subsidence in many coastal regions of the alluvial fan. Consequently, an efficient means of implementing large-scale conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is needed to prevent further overuse of groundwater. Two different optimization scenarios are considered. The results given by the proposed model show that water-usage can be balanced with a stable groundwater level. Our findings may assist officials and researchers in establishing plans to alleviate land subsidence problems.

AB  - For efficient and sustainable utilisation of limited groundwater resources, improved understanding of how vegetation water:use responds to climate variation and the corresponding controls on recharge is essential. This study investigated these responses using a modelling approach. The biophysically based model WAVES was calibrated and validated with more than two years of field experimental data conducted in Mulga (Acacia aneura) in arid central Australia. The validated model was then applied to simulate vegetation growth (as changes in overstory and understory leaf area index; LA!), vegetation water-use and groundwater recharge using observed climate data for the period 1981-2012. Due to large inter-annual climatic variability, especially precipitation, simulated annual mean LAI ranged from 0.12 to 0.35 for the overstory and 0.07 to 0.21 for the understory. These variations in simulated LAI resulted in vegetation water-use varying greatly from year-to-year, from 64 to 601 mm pa. Simulated vegetation water-use also showed distinct seasonal patterns. Vegetation dynamics affected by climate variability exerted significant controls on simulated annual recharge, which was greatly reduced to 0-48 mm compared to that (58-672 mm) only affected by climate. Understanding how climate variability and land use/land cover change interactively impact on groundwater recharge significantly improves groundwater resources management in arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - A water budget model is proposed to estimate the infiltration, runoff, evapotranspiration and recharge in vadose zone and apply to a case study. The instantaneous redistribution of infiltrated water is assumed to be uniform and a linear relationship between evapotranspiration and effective saturation is imposed. Infiltration is described by Philip's solution in conjunction with the time compression approximation method during rainfall. Runoff occurred when rainfall rate exceeds soil-infiltrating rate. The soil profile drainage was determined by evapotranspiration and recharge. Cumulative infiltration, runoff, evapotranspiration and recharge are estimated with different climate conditions and different soil hydraulic properties during simulating period. Analysis shows that initial effective saturation affects the estimated results in this water budget model in the short or mid-term simulations while not in long-term simulations. The climatic conditions of Yun-Lin plain area, Taiwan from 1991 to 1997 are used by referring to hydrological and hydrogeological parameters to provide the computational procedures of this study for estimating recharge. Results showed that the amount of annual recharge was affected by the amount of annual rainfall and soil properties.

AB  - The objective of this study was to test indicators and improve the assessment of groundwater sustainability by using a synthetic method. An indicator system of groundwater sustainability was constructed under the framework of driver-pressure-state-impact-response, and a method for the assessment of groundwater sustainability was developed by using analytic hierarchy process together with information entropy theory. This method was used to calculate the weight of each indicator. And then, the sustainability scale was determined by the indicator zoning methods. The assessment results of a case study in Hohhot Plain, China, demonstrated that the method greatly reduced the randomicity and anthropogenic influence on the determination of weight of indicators; and gave a quantitative classification on sustainability scale which produced a rational result on the assessment of groundwater sustainability in Hohhot Plain.

AB  - This study aims to derive the optimal solution for well locations based on the allowable withdrawal. To demonstrate the proposed technique, a numerical model of a typical well field at the Qinbei Power Plant was constructed and 20 possible drawdown scenarios were simulated for each of three different arrangements of pumping wells. The concept of the Unit Increased Drawdown Value (UIDV) was used as a basis to select the location of pumping wells, where the UIDV is defined as the increase in drawdown associated with the addition of a unit of extraction. Results showed that for modeled well fields with the same number of wells and rates of exploitation, drawdown will reach the maximum and minimum when the well field is located in the recharge zone and discharge zone, respectively, because of the specific relationships between groundwater and surface water. This paper considered a pumping program with maximum exploitation and minimum costs corresponding to allowable withdrawals of 2.44 m(3)/s and 1.07 m(3)/s, respectively, and the relationship between groundwater and surface water was elucidated. The study results provide a theoretical basis for the layout of wells. The solution takes economic factors into consideration and describes the best solution for well locations to meet drawdown limitations during pumping applications.

AB  - China is facing a water resources crisis with growing concerns as to the reliable supply of water for agricultural, industrial and domestic needs. High inter-annual rainfall variability and increasing consumptive use across the country exacerbates the situation further and is a constraint on future development. For water sustainability, it is necessary to examine the differences in water demand and supply and their spatio-temporal distribution in order to quantify the dimensions of the water risk. Here, a detailed quantitative assessment of water risk as measured by the spatial distribution of cumulated deficits for China is presented. Considering daily precipitation and temperature variability over fifty years and the current water demands, risk measures are developed to inform county level water deficits that account for both within-year and across-year variations in climate. We choose political rather than watershed boundaries since economic activity and water use are organized by county and the political process is best informed through that unit. As expected, the risk measures highlight North China Plain counties as highly water stressed. Regions with high water stress have high inter-annual variability in rainfall and now have depleted groundwater aquifers. The stress components due to agricultural, industrial and domestic water demands are illustrated separately to assess the vulnerability of particular sectors within the country to provide a basis for targeted policy analysis for reducing water stress.

AB  - Studies of hydro-meteorological time series have identified decadal and inter-decadal oscillations with quasi-cyclic components as part of long-term natural variations in the data. Concerns over impacts of global warming and climate change have led to many studies of sustainable development and adaptation strategies, involving historic trend estimations in order to forecast future trends. This paper demonstrates the impacts of natural oscillations of quasi-cyclic components on the Mann-Kendal and Thiel-Sen tests, the most common methods used for analyzing data trends. Tests on synthetic and real instrumental hydroclimate records suggest that the Mann-Kendall and Thiel-Sen tests are sensitive to oscillations of quasi-cyclic components. Data record length relative to the periodicity of cycles, magnitude, and phase of the longest quasi-cyclic component are the three most important factors affecting these tests. If the length of the record is greater than three cycle lengths, the impact on the M-K and T-S tests should be minimal. Given the predominance of 45-60 year climate cycles observed in instrumental records, trend analyses of time series records <60 years should be done with caution. These results provide insight for appropriate temporal trend analyses of hydroclimate and associate time series. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a linear programming model to study the conjunctive use Of Surface water and groundwater for optimal water allocation in Taiwan. Increasing demand for water emphasizes the proper need for effective planning and development of irrigated resources. A groundwater simulation model was performed to construct the hydrogeological structure of the regional Pingtung Plain in the southwest part of Taiwan and the optimal withdrawal of three irrigation areas in Pingtung Plain was analysed. The optimal ratios for allocating water of three canals are analysed in this research. The optimal distribution rate of each canal depends on the season, irrigation methods and crops, which are two paddy rice and one upland crop. After simulation of various scenarios, optimal simulation results show that the minimal amount of required groundwater and the maximum amount of excess water amounts in the area can be satisfied by current agricultural practices.

AB  - Changes in groundwater level have been recognized by the earthquakes at various epicentral distances. The M9 Sumatra earthquake resulted in changes in the groundwater level, electrical conductivity, and temperature in monitoring wells on Jeju Island, South Korea. In regions of different groundwater type (basal, lower parabasal, upper parabasal, and high-level groundwater), the changes in the groundwater levels at 25 monitoring wells ranged between 4.0 and 49.5 cm; changes in the electrical conductivity at six monitoring wells ranged between 1 and 27,975 mu S/cm; and the changes in water temperature at three wells ranged between 0.02 and 1.37 A degrees C. The irregular groundwater level changes at different locations on the island due to the earthquake reflect various interactions between hydrological properties and seismological processes. The impact of the earthquake was successfully recognized via transfer function modeling between the time series of groundwater level and the tidal oscillation. On the basis of the theoretical aquifer response to the earthquake, storage coefficient estimates for aquifers, which could not be determined from the single-well pumping tests, were determined to be within the range of 1.22 center dot 10(-4)-3.51 center dot 10(-6).

AB  - Understanding and managing groundwater resources require the integration of a large amount of high-quality data from a variety of sources. Due to the limitations in accessing information related to groundwater and subsurface conditions, the gathering of available existing information is of crucial importance when conducting a successful hydrogeological study. Here, we present an approach for the development of an exhaustive and comprehensive groundwater database through (1) the gathering of relevant sources of information relating to groundwater, and (2) the application of a quality control process in order to screen the data for accuracy and quality. This hydrogeological database is then implemented within a GIS (geographic information system) framework coupled to a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) as a personal geodatabase (ESRI format) GIS technology. Once established, the spatial database allows a user to request the relevant data required for a specific hydrogeological study. In addition, stratigraphic data stored within the spatial database may be utilized for constructing 3D subsurface hydrostructural models. In order to achieve this objective, the software Arc Hydro Groundwater combined with the ArcGIS spatial database is shown to be appropriate for the 3D structural representation of aquifers (groundwater reservoirs). The innovative contribution of this approach in building 3D hydrostructural subsurface models from a spatial database resides in simplifying the required step-by-step processes by considering a unified compatible combination of "RDBMS-ArcGIS-Arc Hydro Groundwater" technologies. The proposed methodology is illustrated using data from an ongoing project aimed at developing an inventory of the groundwater resources of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, Quebec (Canada).

AB  - We examined the contribution of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to nutrient budgets in Hwasun Bay, Jeju Island, Korea in August 2009, October 2014, and May 2015. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in fresh groundwater were in the range of 285-716 mu M and 2.3-3.2 mu M, respectively, which were each 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the bay seawater. The outer-bay seawater flowing into the bay was oligotrophic (2.9 +/- 1.9 mu M for DIN and 0.2 +/- 0.3 mu M for DIP). Nutrient budget calculations were performed for each season by accounting for submarine fresh groundwater discharge (SFGD) and water residence times. In August 2009 (DIN = 1.8 mu M and DIN: DIP ratio = 4.6 for the outer-bay water), DIN inputs from SFGD accounted for approximately 40% of the DIN inventory in the bay seawater. In October 2014 (DIN = 1.1 mu M and DIP < 0.05 mu M for the outer-bay water), DIP from SFGD accounted for approximately 100% of the DIP inventory in the bay seawater. In May 2015, mean concentrations of DIN and DIP in the bay seawater were 8.6 +/- 12 mu M and 0.11 +/- 0.04 mu M, respectively, with conservative behaviors in the bay seawater in association with excessive groundwater inputs. These results imply that SGD plays a critical but different role in nutrient budgets and stoichiometry in coastal waters off a volcanic island depending on open-ocean nutrient conditions.

AB  - Percolation ponds have become very popular methods of managed aquifer recharge due to their low cost, ease of construction and the participation and assistance of community. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a percolation pond in a saline aquifer, north of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, to improve the storage and quality of groundwater. Electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar methods were used to understand the subsurface conditions of the area. From these investigations, a suitable location was chosen and a percolation pond was constructed. The quality and quantity of groundwater of the nearby area has improved due to the recharge from the pond. This study indicated that a simple excavation without providing support for the slope and paving of the bunds helped to improve the groundwater quality. This method can be easily adoptable by farmers who can have a small pond within their farm to collect and store the rainwater. The cost of water recharged from this pond works out to be about 0.225 Re/l. Cleaning the pond by scrapping the accumulated sediments needs to be done once a year. Due to the small dimension and high saline groundwater, considerable improvement in quality at greater depths could not be achieved. However, ponds of larger size with recharge shafts can directly recharge the aquifer and help to improve the quality of water at greater depths.

AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) has a serious shortage of freshwater resources, and crop production consumes approximately 75% of the region's water. To estimate water consumption of different crops and crop structures in the NCP, the Hebei southern plain (HSP) was selected as a study area, as it is a typical region of groundwater overdraft in the NCP. In this study, the water footprint (WF) of crop production, comprised of green, blue and grey water footprints, and its annual variation were analyzed. The results demonstrated the following: (1) the WF from the production of main crops was 41.8 km(3) in 2012. Winter wheat, summer maize and vegetables were the top water-consuming crops in the HSP. The water footprint intensity (WFI) of cotton was the largest, and for vegetables, it was the smallest; (2) the total WF, WFblue, WFgreen and WFgrey for 13 years (2000-2012) of crop production were 604.8, 288.5, 141.3 and 175.0 km(3), respectively, with an annual downtrend from 2000 to 2012; (3) winter wheat, summer maize and vegetables consumed the most groundwater, and their blue water footprint (WFblue) accounted for 74.2% of the total WFblue in the HSP; (4) the crop structure scenarios analysis indicated that, with approximately 20% of arable land cultivated with winter wheat-summer maize in rotation, 38.99% spring maize, 10% vegetables and 10% fruiters, a sustainable utilization of groundwater resources can be promoted, and a sufficient supply of food, including vegetables and fruits, can be ensured in the HSP.

AB  - A method of estimating groundwater recharge, based on water-balance components using the SWAT-MODFLOW model (an integrated surface water-groundwater model), is described. A multi-reservoir storage routing module is suggested instead of a single storage routing module in SWAT; this represents a more realistic delay in the travel of water through the vadose zone. By using this module, the parameter related to the delay time can be optimized by checking the correlation between simulated recharge and observed groundwater levels. The final step of this procedure is to compare simulated groundwater levels as well as the simulated watershed stream flow with the observed groundwater levels and watershed stream flow. This method is applied to the Mihocheon watershed in South Korea to estimate spatio-temporal groundwater recharge distribution. The computed annual recharge rate is compared with the independently estimated recharge rate using BFLOW. The hydrologic modelling results show that the annual average recharge rate should be estimated by a long-term continuous simulation with a distributed hydrologic modelling technique.

AB  - A holistic approach to groundwater sustainability considers the hydrological, ecological, socio-economic and technological aspects of groundwater utilization. Exploitable groundwater should be determined by physical analysis, as well as by social compromises within a community. In this work, an integrated surface water-groundwater model, SWAT-MODFLOW, is used to examine changes in hydrological components due to various groundwater pumping scenarios in the Mihocheon watershed of South Korea. Under a total groundwater abstraction of 104 mm, which is slightly less than the amount currently permissible by law, a change in storage levels of -16 mm occurred. This abstraction value, which corresponds to 33% of the annual recharge, may be an exploitable groundwater reserve available to Cheongju City, Korea. [GRAPHICS] Editor D.

AB  - Ephemeral rivers in dryland regions exhibit a high interannual variability of streamflow regime, mainly dominated by floods. In these environments, floods are a water resource and a potential hazard with important socioeconomic implications. The Fish River (86,600 km(2)) is the largest ephemeral stream in Namibia and, recently, also the focus of new development plans, including construction of the largest dam in Namibia. The hydrological analysis to support decisions implies large uncertainties owing to spatial-limited and short hydrological records (since 1962). Here we investigate the current and past patterns of extreme floods combining instrumental, historical, and palaeoflood records. Palaeoflood studies were performed at two reaches with preserved sedimentary evidence: at the upper sector (Vogelkranz) upstream of Hardap Dam (similar to 13% catchment area) and in the lower part of the river, in the Fish River Canyon National Park (70% catchment area). In the Hardap reach, the palaeoflood record identified at least eight large floods during the last 350 years, with the largest flood reaching a minimum discharge of 4800 m(3) s(-1) (150-year return period). In the Fish River Canyon reach, the sedimentary record shows at least 12 large floods over the last 400 years, the largest with an estimated minimum discharge of 8700 m(3) s(-1). The elevation of alluvial surfaces without flood evidence provided an upper bound for flood stages, associated with discharges of 6400 m(3) s(-1) and 16,140 m(3) s(-1) for the upper and mid-lower Fish River respectively. In the upper reach, the flood frequency analysis (FFA) combining systematic and palaeoflood data provided lower discharges (similar to 25%) of the flood quantiles than the ones using only systematic data sets. In the Fish River Canyon reach, incorporation of the palaeoflood data into the FFA results in slightly higher values in the magnitude of the higher flood quantiles (similar to 4-7%). The FFA analysis using an upper limited lognormal distribution function (LN4) fitted with palaeoflood data shows a good performance with a slow behaviour approaching the upper limit. Our flood frequency results suggest that the Hardap Dam should increase the spillway capacity and safety check flood of the original design in order to satisfy the dam safety criteria. However, the projected reevaluation figures calculated from conventional hydrological methods results in an overestimation of the safety floods according to our estimations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper assesses a case of co-management of groundwater between the state of Texas, pushing for the rationalisation of groundwater management, and local (mainly farming) communities organised in Groundwater Conservation Districts (GCDs), which are protective of their private groundwater rights. We first describe the main legal and policy steps that have shaped this relationship. The article focuses on the Texan portion of the Ogallala Aquifer in the High Plains aquifer system - an almost non-renewable system covering 90,000 km(2) and providing 95% of the irrigation needs in northern Texas. With this example, we further highlight the strategies of both parties, the different political, administrative, legal and regulatory complexities of the struggle around the definition of GCD-level aquifer management rules (the so-called 'Desired Future Conditions'). We end by reflecting on the power balance that has resulted from successive adjustments to a co-management form of governance, the advantages and disadvantages of a multi-layered state water governance system, and whether the de facto 'managed depletion' of the Ogallala Aquifer in Texas should be seen as an achievement or a failure.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify geochemical processes and Quaternary geological events responsible for the variations in groundwater geochemistry observed in a sedimentary rock aquifer system, including brackish to saline groundwater. Inorganic constituents and environmental isotopes were analyzed for 146 groundwater samples. Dissolution of carbonates dominates in recharge areas, resulting in Ca-, Mg-HCO(3) groundwater. Further along flow paths, under confined conditions, Ca(2+)-Na(+) ion exchange causes groundwater evolution to Na-HCO(3) type. Na-Cl groundwater is also found and it falls on a seawater mixing line. Using conservative tracers, Cl(-) and Br(-), the original Champlain Sea water is shown to have been, in the region, a mixture of about 34% seawater and 66% freshwater, a composition still retained by some groundwater. Na-Cl groundwater thus results from mixing with former Champlain Sea water and also from solute diffusion from overlying marine clay. The system is thus found to be at different stages of desalinization, from the original Champlain Sea water still present in hydraulically stagnant areas of the aquifer to fully flushed conditions in parts, where more flow occurs, especially in recharge zones. The geochemical processes are integrated within the hydrogeological context to produce a conceptual geochemical evolution model for groundwater of the aquifer system.

AB  - The study of groundwater hydrogeochemistry of the Paleozoic Basses-Laurentides sedimentary rock aquifer system in Quebec produced a Large geochemical dataset. Groundwater samples were collected at 153 sites over a 1500 km(2) study area and analyzed for major and minor ions. The large number of data can lead to difficulties in the integration, interpretation and representation of the results. Two multivariate statistical methods, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA), were applied to a subgroup of the dataset to evaluate their usefulness to classify the groundwater samples, and to identify geochemical processes controlling groundwater geochemistry. This subgroup consisted of 144 samples and 14 parameters (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, Fe2+, Mn2+, Br-, Sr2+, F-, Ba2+, HS- ). Seven geochemically distinct clusters , C1-C7, resulted from the HCA. Samples from clusters C3, C4, C6 and C7 are mostly located in preferential recharge areas. The majority of these samples have Ca-Mg-HCO3 recharge groundwater (C3, C6, C7) and Na-HCO3 evolved groundwater (C4). Samples from the other three clusters (C1, C2, C5) are characteristic of an aquifer system under confined conditions. The majority of these samples have Na-HCO3 evolved groundwater (C1, C5) and Na-Cl ancient groundwater that exhibits elevated concentrations in Br-(C2). In addition to recognizing the importance of hydrogeological conditions on groundwater geochemistry, the distribution of clusters also showed the importance of the geological formations on minor and trace elements, such as Fe2+, Mn2+, Sr2+, F- and Ba2+. The first five components of the PCA account for 78.3% of the total variance in the dataset. Component 1 is defined by highly positive loadings in Na+, Cl- and Br- and is related to groundwater mixing with Champlain Sea water and solute diffusion from the marine clay aquitard. The high positive loadings in Ca2+ and Mg2+ of component 2 suggest the importance of dissolution of carbonate rocks in this aquifer system. From their characteristic loadings, the first two components are defined as the "salinity" and "hardness" components, respectively. Components 3-5 are related to more local and geological effects. The integration of the HCA and the PCA, with conventional classification of groundwater types, as well. as with the hydrogeological and geological contexts, allowed the division of the region into four main geochemical areas, providing an improved regional picture of the aquifer system dynamics and hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater. The following factors were recognized as influencing the evolution of groundwater identified in every geochemical area: (1) geological characteristics including sedimentary rock type and till mineralogy; (2) hydrogeological characteristics represented by the level of confinement and the hydraulic gradient; and (3) the geological history including the latest glaciation and the Champlain Sea invasion. With its integrated approach, this hydrogeochemical study contributes to the characterization and understanding of complex groundwater flow systems, and provides an example of the long-term geochemical evolution of hydrogeological systems after a major perturbation in this case seawater invasion.

AB  - The Grootfontein Aquifer, part of the important North West dolomite aquifers, supplies about 20% of Mahikeng's domestic water needs. Over-abstraction caused the large natural spring draining the aquifer to disappear in 1981, and groundwater levels have since fallen nearly 30 m in the vicinity of the former spring. Analysis of water levels and a water balance using recent assessments of groundwater abstractions confirm past work describing the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer, and suggest that current abstractions need to fall by between 19 and 36 ML/day (7 and 13 Mm(3)/a) to bring the aquifer back into long-term balance. Continued over-abstraction at Grootfontein implies increasing risk to Mahikeng's water supply, and illuminates the larger challenge of ensuring groundwater use in the North West dolomites that is sustainable and in the public interest.

AB  - The Grootfontein groundwater aquifer is important to the water supply of the town Mahikeng in the North West Province of South Africa and to commercial agriculture in the Province, but the water table has fallen by up to 28 m as a consequence of over-abstraction since the 1980s. Institutional and hydrogeological issues impact the aquifer in complex ways, described here as a hydro-social system. Whilst the hydrogeology is well understood and South African laws provide for sustainable groundwater governance, poor stakeholder collaboration and other institutional problems mean that the over-abstraction is likely to persist - an example of an undesirable Nash equilibrium. The Grootfontein aquifer case shows that groundwater underpins wider social-ecological-economic systems, and that more holistic management - taking the institutional context into account - is needed to underpin economic growth, employment and other public outcomes. Significance: The cost of better natural resource stewardship, including groundwater, is likely to be considerably less than the losses that occur when it is absent. If local groundwater was better managed, it could make water supplies in Mahikeng cheaper and more reliable, which would in turn support local economic growth and employment.

AB  - Deltaic coastal areas are constituted by a patchwork of brackish lagoons and freshwater bodies; these coastal wetland-aquifer systems are fragile ecosystems that usually respond quickly to climate changes. To understand the hydrological processes occurring within the lagoons and the groundwater system of the Po River Delta (Italy), the contribution of both evaporation and anthropogenic factors on groundwater salinization was assessed. A time series (2002-2015) of monthly average climatic data and a temperature-salinity dataset were used in three adjacent saline-brackish lagoons with the aim to identify the actual evaporation patterns and predict future trends using artificial neural networks (ANN). Moreover, the use of groundwater and surface water equivalent freshwater heads, along with the geological architecture, allowed linking the fluctuation of lagoon salinities with the degree of hydraulic connection between wetland and aquifer system. Results show that the less a lagoon is hydraulically connected with the aquifer, the higher is the salinity peak that could be reached at the end of the summer period. ANN forecasts highlight that in the near future this behaviour would be the rule rather than the exception. The increase in salinity of surface waters could be of serious concern, especially for aquaculture, sensitive to sharp salinity increases.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers is an urgent issue for the actual and future groundwater supply and a detailed characterization of groundwater quality with depth is a fundamental prerequisite to correctly distinguish salinization processes. In this study, interpolated Cl- maps of the Po River delta coastal aquifer (Italy), gained with Integrated Depth Sampling (IDS) and Multi-Level Sampling (MIS) techniques, are compared. The data set used to build up the IDS and MIS interpolated Cl- maps come from numerous monitoring campaigns on surface and ground waters, covering the time frame from 2010 to 2014. The IDS interpolated Cl- map recalls the phenomenon of actual seawater intrusion, with Cl- concentration never exceeding that of seawater and the absence of hypersaline groundwater all over the study area. On the contrary, in the MIS interpolated Cl- maps the lower portion of the unconfined aquifer presents hypersaline groundwater making it necessary to consider salinization processes other than actual seawater intrusion, like upward flux from a saline aquitard. Results demonstrate the obligation of using MIS in reconstructing a reliable representation of the distribution of salinity, especially in areas where the density contrast between fresh and saline groundwater is large. Implications of the reported field case are not limited to the local situation but have a wider significance, since the IDS technique is often employed in saltwater intrusion monitoring even in recent works, with detrimental effect on the sustainable water resource management of coastal aquifers.

AB  - Physical habitat is important in determining the carrying capacity of juvenile brown trout, and within freshwater management. Summer daytime physical habitat selection for the parr lifestage (7-20 cm) juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) was assessed in 6 small lowland streams. Habitat preference was determined for the four variables; water velocity, water depth, substrate and cover, and the preferences for physical habitat selection were expressed in terms of habitat suitability indices (HSI's). The statistical confidence of HSI's was evaluated using power analysis. It was found that a minimum of 22 fish observations was needed to have statistical confidence in the HSIs for water depth, and a minimum of 92 fish observations for water velocity during daytime summer conditions. Generally parr were utilising the deeper habitats, indicating preference for deeper water. Cover was also being selected for at all sites, but selection was inconsistent among sites for the variables substrate and velocity. The results indicate that during daytime summer conditions water depth is a significant variable for parr habitat selection in these small lowland streams, with cover also being important. Therefore, daytime refugia may be a critical limiting factor for parr in small lowland streams, and important for stream management actions under the Water Framework Directive.

AB  - To improve the behavioural realism of a water resource model, this study coupled hydrologic modelling with stated preference research, thereby incorporating an empirical estimate of behavioural parameters to represent residents' landscape decisions in an urban environment. The stated preference data came from a discrete choice experiment in which residents were asked to choose among several possible lawn plots - varying in size, turf variety, and aesthetic qualities. The discrete choice experiment also included subsidies for lawn replacement, and information about estimated water use and watering costs for each lawn choice. We prepared a behavioural model utilizing coefficients from a mixed logic model estimated from the stated preference data, and then coupled it with a water resources model of the Okanagan Basin using the Water Evaluation and Planning System. We then conducted a scenario analysis using the coupled socio-hydrological model to simulate the extent to which residents would adopt alternative lawns under varying incentives and subsequently computed corresponding changes in water demand. The results indicate that proposing alternative lawn configurations to residents and providing site-specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs, along with a small subsidy, could lead to considerable reduction of outdoor water use through voluntary adoption. Under a scenario in which the attributes of the suggested lawn configuration matched those most preferred by residents in the choice experiment, the suggested configuration was widely adopted in the Okanagan, but a scenario with a more extreme water conserving lawn configuration reduced overall outdoor water use by a greater amount even though the configuration was adopted by a smaller percentage of residents. This study illustrates the relationship between lawn preferences and water use and supports calls to integrate hydrological and social modelling in order to capture the complex interactions between human behaviour and water use.

AB  - A normative framework for the governance of groundwater is emerging at the global level. However, existing analyses have not comprehensively covered all the governance texts that have a bearing on transboundary groundwater resources or looked at them from the perspective of sustainable groundwater governance. Therefore, this paper responds to the questions: What are the global governance texts (including international laws) applicable to groundwater resources; to which forms of the resource do they apply; which principles have been included over time; and what are the implications for sustainable development of groundwater resources now and in the future? The analysis highlights key groundwater concepts, discusses twelve global groundwater governance texts and the thirty principles therein, classifies the principles into ideal-typical categories based on the sustainable development concept; and assesses the gaps and conflicts between the principles and texts. The paper has three key findings. First, groundwater governance is rapidly evolving and there are a number of principles available to promote sustainable development. Second, however, these collective principles do not adequately address (a) the link with all water resources; (b) the potential impact of climate change on water resources; and (c) the impact of trade on equitable sharing of groundwater and protection of groundwater-related ecosystems. Third, to the extent that this collection of principles can contribute to sustainable development, they are inconsistently included in the legally binding groundwater governance texts. Therefore, much progress is needed to ensure a global normative framework that can guide the sustainable governance of groundwater resources.

AB  - There is evidence that expected warming trends from increased greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing have been locally 'masked' by irrigation induced cooling, and it is uncertain how the magnitude of this irrigation masking effect will change in the future. Using an irrigation dataset integrated into a global general circulation model, we investigate the equilibrium magnitude of irrigation induced cooling under modern (Year 2000) and increased (A1B Scenario, Year 2050) GHG forcing, using modern irrigation rates in both scenarios. For the modern scenario, the cooling is largest over North America, India, the Middle East, and East Asia. Under increased GHG forcing, this cooling effect largely disappears over North America, remains relatively unchanged over India, and intensifies over parts of China and the Middle East. For North America, irrigation significantly increases precipitation under modern GHG forcing; this precipitation enhancement largely disappears under A1B forcing, reducing total latent heat fluxes and the overall irrigation cooling effect. Over India, irrigation rates are high enough to keep pace with increased evaporative demand from the increased GHG forcing and the magnitude of the cooling is maintained. Over China, GHG forcing reduces precipitation and shifts the region to a drier evaporative regime, leading to a relatively increased impact of additional water from irrigation on the surface energy balance. Irrigation enhances precipitation in the Middle East under increased GHG forcing, increasing total latent heat fluxes and enhancing the irrigation cooling effect. Ultimately, the extent to which irrigation will continue to compensate for the warming from increased GHG forcing will primarily depend on changes in the background evaporative regime, secondary irrigation effects (e.g. clouds, precipitation), and the ability of societies to maintain (or increase) current irrigation rates.

AB  - The early twentieth-century North American pluvial (1905-17) was one of the most extreme wet periods of the last 500 yr and directly led to overly generous water allotments in the water-limited American west. Here, the causes and dynamics of the pluvial event are examined using a combination of observation-based datasets and general circulation model (GCM) experiments. The character of the moisture surpluses during the pluvial differed by region, alternately driven by increased precipitation (the Southwest), low evaporation from cool temperatures (the central plains), or a combination of the two (the Pacific Northwest). Cool temperature anomalies covered much of the West and persisted through most months, part of a globally extensive period of cooler land and sea surface temperatures (SST). Circulation during boreal winter favored increased moisture import and precipitation in the Southwest, while other regions and seasons were characterized by near-normal or reduced precipitation. Anomalies in the mean circulation, precipitation, and SST fields are partially consistent with the relatively weak El Nino forcing during the pluvial and, also, reflect the impacts of positive departures in the Arctic Oscillation that occurred in 10 of the 13 pluvial winters. Differences between the reanalysis dataset, an independent statistical drought model, and GCM simulations highlight some of the remaining uncertainties in understanding the full extent of SST forcing of North American hydroclimatic variability.

AB  - Tree-ring-based reconstructions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) indicate that, during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), the central plains of North America experienced recurrent periods of drought spanning decades or longer. These megadroughts had exceptional persistence compared to more recent events, but the causes remain uncertain. The authors conducted a suite of general circulation model experiments to test the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) and land surface forcing on the MCA megadroughts over the central plains. The land surface forcing is represented as a set of dune mobilization boundary conditions, derived from available geomorphological evidence and modeled as increased bare soil area and a dust aerosol source (32 degrees-44 degrees N, 105 degrees-95 degrees W). In the experiments, cold tropical Pacific SST forcing suppresses precipitation over the central plains but cannot reproduce the overall drying or persistence seen in the PDSI reconstruction. Droughts in the scenario with dust aerosols, however, are amplified and have significantly longer persistence than in other model experiments, more closely matching the reconstructed PDSI. This additional drying occurs because the dust increases the shortwave planetary albedo, reducing energy inputs to the surface and boundary layer. The energy deficit increases atmospheric stability, inhibiting convection and reducing cloud cover and precipitation over the central plains. Results from this study provide the first model-based evidence that dust aerosol forcing and land surface changes could have contributed to the intensity and persistence of the central plains megadroughts, although uncertainties remain in the formulation of the boundary conditions and the future importance of these feedbacks.

AB  - River-aquifer exchange is highly spatially variable. For this reason, methods that estimate river gain or loss over small scales cannot be easily extrapolated to provide flux estimates over the tens to hundreds of kilometres of river length required for regional water management. Flux estimates at large scales can be provided by analysis of head gradients, differential flow gauging, river chemistry and groundwater chemistry. Hydraulic gradients allow estimation of exchange fluxes over scales of hundreds of metres or more, if piezometers located at similar distances from the river are available for measurement of aquifer heads. However, the difficulty of measuring hydraulic conductivity at this scale, and the need for piezometers at regular intervals along the river, mean that this method is likely to be inaccurate and difficult to apply in many catchments. Flow gauging has the potential to estimate fluxes over large scales, although it is difficult to apply in rivers where there is significant surface water pumping or where there are large numbers of tributaries. River chemistry can potentially provide estimates of exchange flux over distances of tens to hundreds of kilometres with a spatial resolution of hundreds of metres. Groundwater chemistry can provide estimates of loss rates at small to regional scales, depending upon the availability of piezometers for groundwater sampling, and the tracers that are used. Each method has its own advantages and limitations, and a combination of methods will usually provide most reliable flux estimates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the water balance of large groundwater systems is fundamental for the sustainable management of the resource. The vertical leakage (i.e. discharge to upper aquifers or the unconfined water table) component of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) is an example of a poorly constrained but large component of the water balance of Australia's largest groundwater resource. Field estimates of phreatic evapotranspiration (ET) were made at discharge zones along the southwestern margin of the GAB using eddy covariance station and micro-lysimeter measurements, and inversion of chloride/isotope soil profile measurements. The field estimates were assigned to three major landforms associated with areas of increasingly higher evaporative discharge and progressively decreasing depths to the water table. These landforms were mapped using remote sensing and digital elevation data, with characteristically higher soil moisture, salt precipitation, and lower surface temperature compared to areas distal to discharge zones. Based on the field measurements, broad ranges of phreatic ET (0.5-10, 10-100 and 100-300 mm y(-1)) were assigned to the major land-types. The higher phreatic ET discharge zones mapped by supervised classification of satellite data are 8-28% of the total regional vertical leakage component estimated by numerical modelling of the GAB. In comparison, the higher discharge zones estimated by landform mapping are 73-251% of the total vertical leakage component estimated by modelling. The mapped distribution of the high discharge areas has important implications for modelling of the GAB. In the western sub-basin, most of the estimated recharge can be accounted for by phreatic ET in the high discharge zones located around the Basin margins, implying that vertical leakage rates distal to the margins are very low and that discharge may exceed current recharge. In contrast, the results for the eastern sub-basin suggest that vertical leakage rates around the South Australian portion of the Basin margin are low and that more of the vertical leakage component in the eastern sub-basin is occurring distal to the Basin margins. Consequently, the pathways for vertical leakage in the eastern sub-basin are likely to be more complex than for the western sub-basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Downstream trends in hydraulic geometry and substrate characteristics were investigated along a 200 km reach of the Ninnescah River in south central Kansas, USA. The Ninnescah River is a large sand-bed, perennial, braided river located in the Central Plains physiographic province and is a tributary of the Arkansas River. Hydraulic geometry characteristics were measured at eleven reaches and included slope, sinuosity, bankfull channel width, and bankfull channel depth. Results indicated that the Ninnescah River followed a predicted trend of decreasing slope and increasing depth and width downstream. There were localized divergences in the central tendency, most notability downstream of a substantial tributary that is impounded and at the end of the surveying reach where the Ninnescah River approaches the Arkansas River. Surface grain-size samples were taken from the top 10 cm of the bed at five points across the wetted cross-section within each of the 11 reaches. Sediment analyses demonstrated a significant trend in downstream fining of surface grain-sizes (D-90 and D-50) but unlike previous studies of sand-bedded rivers we observed coarsening of substrates downstream of the major tributary confluence. We propose that the overall low discharge from the tributary was the primary reason for coarsening of the bed downstream of the tributary. Results of this study provide valuable baseline information that can provide insight in to how Great Plains sand-bed systems may be conserved, managed, and restored in the future.

AB  - Due to the cost of extracting water, effective and efficient utilization of irrigation water for rice (Oryza sativa L.) is critical to rice farm profitability. The objective of this study is to predict safe stages of development for draining rice. This objective has the potential of saving rice farmers water. A computer program has been developed to predict the stage of development for draining water from rice field soils at which the risk of reduced grain yield or milling quality from insufficient water is considered to be near zero. The parameters of the model are predictions of (i) temperature during rice reproductive growth stages (RRGS) starting at R3, (ii) timing of various RRGS, (iii) maximum amount of water used by the rice crop at each growth stage, and (iv) the water held in the soil profile after draining which is available to the rice crop. The central goals of the model are to allow draining at an RRGS in which (a) the danger of reducing yield and quality from water deficits is at a minimum and (b) water is conserved and land conditions for harvest are improved. Experiments to test the predictions were conducted in 2005 and 2006 at two Arkansas locations: Gillett and Stuttgart. An experiment was also conducted at DeWitt, AR, in 2006. Draining at stages of development predicted by the model did not affect yield milling quality relative to the control for any year or location. Predicted water savings from reduced irrigation ranged between $10.26 to $55.44 ha(-1) depending on pump depth. Implementation of the program can save money, reduce tillage costs, and reduce unnecessary depletion of the aquifers.

AB  - Growing populations demand more food, putting more pressure on soil productivity and sustainability around the world. In western Texas along the Rio Grande Valley, the low natural rainfall requires frequent irrigations for sustaining agriculture. To investigate the impacts of irrigation on soil quality, we collected and modelled geochemical data (major elements and nutrients) on irrigation water, soil pore water, drainage water, and soil samples, and monitored soil moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity with sensors from two pecan, one cotton, and one alfalfa fields in western Texas. This study showed that flood irrigation with both surface (Rio Grande river) and ground waters significantly increased the root-zone salinity, soil sodicity, and nutrient leaching from soils to the underlying aquifers and Rio Grande river from agricultural fields of the arid southwest. The water used for irrigation was high in total dissolved solids (> 500 ppm generally), dominated by Na+, Cl-, Ca2+ and SO42-. After flood irrigation, infiltrating water dissolved salts such as gypsum that have accumulated in the soils due to previous irrigations, or/and mixed existing concentrated soil waters, and approached saturation with respect to these evaporite minerals. Soil water was supersaturated with respect to carbonates as pedogenic calcite precipitated out and reached concentrations of similar to 10 wt% of total soil mass. This suggested that pedogenic carbonate is an important carbon reservoir and precipitation kinetics and controls of such secondary calcite need further investigation for the irrigated agricultural fields in arid regions of the world. Chemistry of agricultural return flow samples collected from drainage ditches was similar to that of irrigation water, suggesting that most of the irrigation water had taken a shallow and short flowpath through the fields to drains. Between irrigation events, soil water became more concentrated as water was lost through evapo-transpiration that led to precipitation of evaporite salts. As a result, sodicity and salinity of soils, especially clayey soils, frequently exceeded the tolerance levels of major crops grown in the region. Here in these fine-textured soils, combination of high evapotranspiration rates, intensive irrigation with water of elevated salinity, and limited infiltration stunted crop growth, decreased soil porosity and permeability, led to poor aeration, and accelerated salt buildup via a positive feedback mechanism. During initial irrigation where soils were saturated, soil water also percolated and recharged to underlying aquifers, and thus salts, nutrients, and trace metals from agricultural practices (i.e., application of fertilizers, irrigation, soil amendments, and pesticide) could be mobilized to shallow groundwaters. This implied that chemistry of Rio Grande river, groundwater, and soil was closely linked. Thus the sustainability of agriculture depended on appropriate water, soil and crop management practices.

AB  - Management of groundwater systems requires realistic conceptual hydrogeological models as a framework for numerical simulation modelling, but also for system understanding and communicating this to stakeholders and the broader community. To help overcome these challenges we developed GVS (Groundwater Visualisation System), a stand-alone desktop software package that uses interactive 3D visualisation and animation techniques. The goal was a user-friendly groundwater management tool that could support a range of existing real-world and pre-processed data, both surface and subsurface, including geology and various types of temporal hydrological information. GVS allows these data to be integrated into a single conceptual hydrogeological model. In addition, 3D geological models produced externally using other software packages, can readily be imported into GVS models, as can outputs of simulations (e.g. piezometric surfaces) produced by software such as MODFLOW or FEFLOW. Boreholes can be integrated, showing any down-hole data and properties, including screen information, intersected geology, water level data and water chemistry. Animation is used to display spatial and temporal changes, with time-series data such as rainfall, standing water levels and electrical conductivity, displaying dynamic processes. Time and space variations can be presented using a range of contouring and colour mapping techniques, in addition to interactive plots of time-series parameters. Other types of data, for example, demographics and cultural information, can also be readily incorporated. The GVS software can execute on a standard Windows or Linux-based PC with a minimum of 2 GB RAM, and the model output is easy and inexpensive to distribute, by download or via USB/DVD/CD. Example models are described here for three groundwater systems in Queensland, northeastern Australia: two unconfined alluvial groundwater systems with intensive irrigation, the Lockyer Valley and the upper Condamine Valley, and the Surat Basin, a large sedimentary basin of confined artesian aquifers. This latter example required more detail in the hydrostratigraphy, correlation of formations with drill-holes and visualisation of simulation piezometric surfaces. Both alluvial system GVS models were developed during drought conditions to support government strategies to implement groundwater management. The Surat Basin model was industry sponsored research, for coal seam gas groundwater management and community information and consultation. The "virtual" groundwater systems in these 3D GVS models can be interactively interrogated by standard functions, plus production of 2D cross-sections, data selection from the 3D scene, rear end database and plot displays. A unique feature is that GVS allows investigation of time-series data across different display modes, both 2D and 3D. GVS has been used successfully as a tool to enhance community/stakeholder understanding and knowledge of groundwater systems and is of value for training and educational purposes. Projects completed confirm that GVS provides a powerful support to management and decision making, and as a tool for interpretation of groundwater system hydrological processes. A highly effective visualisation output is the production of short videos (e.g. 2-5 min) based on sequences of camera 'fly-throughs' and screen images. Further work involves developing support for multi-screen displays and touch-screen technologies, distributed rendering, gestural interaction systems. To highlight the visualisation and animation capability of the GVS software, links to related multimedia hosted online sites are included in the references. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Considering that past climate changes have significantly impacted groundwater resources, quantitative predictions of climate change effects on groundwater recharge may be valuable for effective management of future water resources. This study used 16 global climate models (GCMs) and three global warming scenarios to investigate changes in groundwater recharge rates for a 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate in the U.S. High Plains region. Groundwater recharge was modeled using the Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer model WAVES for a variety of soil and vegetation types representative of the High Plains. The median projection under a 2050 climate includes increased recharge in the Northern High Plains (+8%), a slight decrease in the Central High Plains (-3%), and a larger decrease in the Southern High Plains (-10%), amplifying the current spatial trend in recharge from north to south. There is considerable uncertainty in both the magnitude and direction of these changes in recharge projections. Predicted changes in recharge between dry and wet future climate scenarios encompass both an increase and decrease in recharge rates, with the magnitude of this range greater than 50% of current recharge. On a proportional basis, sensitivity of recharge to changes in rainfall indicates that areas with high current recharge rates are least sensitive to change in rainfall and vice versa. Sensitivity analyses indicate an amplification of change in recharge compared to change in rainfall, and this amplification is in the range of 1-6 with an average of 2.5-3.5 depending upon the global warming scenario.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate groundwater recharge in the Chateauguay River watershed. The Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) model was used to assess daily values of recharge, evapotranspiration and runoff. The study area was divided into a regular grid, 250 m x 250 m, for a total of 47,616 grid elements.The input parameters included soil physical properties, land use, vegetation and climate data. Calibration of HELP was carried out against runoff and baseflow estimates obtained from separation of five river hydrographs. Over a 39 year period, the mean annual recharge rate was estimated at 86 mm, or 9% of the total precipitation. Areas characterized by high water level elevations and unconfined flow conditions were identified as the main recharge areas. Daily estimates show that recharge takes place mainly in spring and fall. Over the observed period, the annual variations of evapotranspiration and runoff were directly related to changes in precipitation, whereas the annual recharge response was subdued, with much lower variations. HELP was also used to assess potential climate change scenarios using data for the driest and most humid years. The mean annual recharge was 51 mm for the driest year and 99 mm for the most humid year. Differences in the spatial distribution of recharge for the predictive scenarios indicate that the areas most sensitive to climate change correspond to the preferential recharge areas.

AB  - Studies on groundwater governance status at EU national and river basin district levels are rare, hindering lessons learned at each administrative scale to be shared. Groundwater is a common-pool resource of strategic significance in the Azores archipelago (Portugal), thus calling for sustainable development. Groundwater governance emerged in the last decades as a path to sustainable resources management, and the present paper characterizes the current status of governance in the Azores, where management is pursued according to a vertically-integrated system. A survey made among 43 specialists showed that despite the instrumental role of groundwater for water supply there is a need to increase awareness on groundwater valuing and protection. The application of benchmark criteria to evaluate the groundwater governance state-of-art shows that technical capacities are diminishing governance effectiveness due to the lack of quantitative data, and further enforcing of the groundwater legal framework to the specificities of the Azores is needed. The empowerment of the government agency being responsible for the groundwater management is also envisaged. The failure to account for the economic dimension of the groundwater governance, the insufficient development of cross-sectorial approaches, and the unsuccessful public participation are other weaknesses on the groundwater governance in the Azores.

AB  - The aim of this article is to critically analyse the governance challenges and opportunities of groundwater in Australia, in particular in South Australia, and Western Australia. It investigates these challenges focusing attention on the design and implementation of governance instruments, for example policy and law that include the principles of participation, accountability and sustainable use. In order to identify current challenges and opportunities faced by groundwater governance in Australia, first a doctrinal analysis is included, and then empirical work is done through 29 in-depth interviews with government and non-government stakeholders. The main findings are: despite the past decades of water governance reform, groundwater continues to be neglected; and not all States and Territories have fully implemented such reforms. For example, Western Australia continues to breach the National Water Initiative. Moreover, implementing meaningful participation and accountability procedures in groundwater planning, as well as sustainable groundwater use continue to be an elusive goal.

AB  - Environmental isotopes and water quality indicators (e.g. TDS and NO(3) contents) were used to characterize the age, recharge history and controls on the quality of groundwater resources in the Yuncheng Basin, north China, where extensive extraction occurs for agriculture and domestic supply. delta(18)O and delta(2)H values as low as -10.6%. and -73 parts per thousand, respectively, together with low radiocarbon activities (<20 pmC) show that deep groundwater comprises palaeowaters largely recharged in the late Pleistocene (similar to 10 to 22 ka B.P.) under a cooler climate than the present. Shallow groundwater has higher radiocarbon activities (>70 pmC), indicating a significant component of modern (post-1950s) recharge. The shallow groundwater has higher delta(18)O and delta(2)H values (up to -8.1%. and -54 parts per thousand) that are similar to those in modern summer monsoon rainfall, indicating that current recharge is via direct infiltration and/or leakage of ephemeral streams during heavy rain events. Historic recharge rates estimated using radiocarbon ages are between 1 and 10 mm/year, corresponding to <2% of local rainfall, which is lower than estimates of modern recharge nearby based on tritium data. The relationship between groundwater delta(18)O values and (14)C ages is similar to that observed in groundwater from other basins in northern China, confirming that much deep groundwater in the region is palaeowater, and suggesting that a broad scale assessment of groundwater residence times may be made from delta(18)O and delta(2)H values. Most deep groundwater has low TDS and nitrate concentrations (median 1090 mg/L and 1.8 mg/L, respectively), while shallow groundwater has TDS contents of up to 8450 mg/L (median 2010 mg/L) and NO(3) concentrations up to 630 mg/L (median 31 mg/L). A lack of enrichment in delta(18)O values in the high salinity shallow groundwater indicates that transpiration by crops and possibly minor mineral dissolution are the major salinisation processes, rather than evaporation or leakage from salt lakes. The majority of nitrate in groundwater has delta(15)N (NO3) values between 0.8 parts per thousand and 5.0 parts per thousand and delta(18)O(NO3) values between 1.8 parts per thousand and 4.1 parts per thousand, indicating that synthetic fertilizers are the main source of elevated NO(3) concentrations. Increasing residence times from east-to-west in deep groundwaters reflect the historic regional flow pattern in the basin. However, present-day flow is now dictated by a large cone of depression that has formed due to intensive deep groundwater pumping since the 1980s. High downward vertical hydraulic gradients (up to 0.45) have also developed as a result of this pumping, promoting downwards leakage of shallow water, indicated by high nitrate concentrations (>20 mg/L) in some deep wells (>180 m). Preferential leakage has occurred near the Linyi fault, in the northern Sushui River Basin. Salinisation, nitrate contamination and excessive drawdown of deep groundwater are major concerns for the future of the groundwater resources in this region. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding and managing impacts from mining on groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) and other groundwater users requires development of defensible science supported by adequate field data. This usually leads to the creation of predictive models and analysis of the likely impacts of mining and their accompanying uncertainties. The identification, monitoring and management of impacts on GDEs are often a key component of mine approvals, which need to consider and attempt to minimise the risks that negative impacts may arise. Here we examine a case study where approval for a large mining project in Australia (Carmichael Coal Mine) was challenged in court on the basis that it may result in more extensive impacts on a GDE (Doongmabulla Springs) of high ecological and cultural significance than predicted by the proponent. We show that throughout the environmental assessment and approval process, significant data gaps and scientific uncertainties remained unresolved. Evidence shows that the assumed conceptual hydrogeological model for the springs could be incorrect, and that at least one alternative conceptualisation (that the springs are dependent on a deep fault) is consistent with the available field data. Assumptions made about changes to spring flow as a consequence of mine-induced drawdown also appear problematic, with significant implications for the spring-fed wetlands. Despite the large scale of the project, it appears that critical scientific data required to resolve uncertainties and construct robust models of the springs' relationship to the groundwater system were lacking at the time of approval, contributing to uncertainty and conflict. For this reason, we recommend changes to the approval process that would require a higher standard of scientific information to be collected and reviewed, particularly in relation to key environmental assets during the environmental impact assessment process in future projects.

AB  - Groundwater overexploitation and aquifer overexploitation are terms that are becoming common in water-re-sources management. Hydrologists. managers and journalists use them when talking about stressed aquifers or some groundwater conflict. Overexploitation may be defined as the situation in which, for sonic years, average aquifer abstraction rate is, greater than. or close to the average recharge rate. But rate and extent of recharge areas are often very uncertain. Besides, they may be modified by human activities and aquifer development. In practice, however, an aquifer is often considered as overexploited when some persistent negative results of aquifer development are felt or perceived. such as a continuous water-level drawdown. progressive water-quality deterioration, increase of abstraction cost. or ecological damage. But negative results do not necessarily imply that abstraction is greater than recharge. They may be simply due to well interferences and the long transient period that follow changes in the aquifer water balance. Groundwater storage is depleted to some extent during the transient period after abstraction is increased. Its duration depends on aquifer size. specific storage and permeability. Which level of "aquifer overexploitation" is advisable or bearable. depends oil the detailed and updated consideration of aquifer-development effects and the measures implemented for correction. This should not be the result of applying general rules based on sonic indirect data. Monitoring. sound aquifer knowledge, and calculation or modelling, of behaviour are needed in the framework of a set of objectives and policies. They should be established by a management institution, with the involvement of groundwater stakeholders, and take into account the environmental and,octal constraints. Aquifer overexploitation. which often is perceived to be associated with something ethically bad, is not necessarily detrimental if it is not permanent. It may be a,step towards sustainable development. Actually, the term aquifer overexploitation is mostly a qualifier that intends to point to a concern about the evolution of the aquifer flow system in some specific, restricted points of view, but without a precise hydrodynamic meaning. Implementing, groundwater management and protection meat sures needs quantitative appraisal of aquifer evolution and effects based on detailed Multidisciplinary studies. which have to he supported by reliable data.

AB  - Intensive groundwater development is a common circumstance in semiarid and arid areas. Often abstraction exceeds recharge, thus continuously depleting reserves. There is groundwater mining when the recovery of aquifer reserves needs more than 50 years. The MASE project has been carried out to compile what is known about Spain and specifically about the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula and the Canary Islands. The objective was the synthetic analysis of available data on the hydrological, economic, managerial, social, and ethical aspects of groundwater mining. Since the mid-20th century, intensive use of groundwater in south-eastern Spain allowed extending and securing the areas with traditional surface water irrigation of cash crops and their extension to former dry lands, taking advantage of good soils and climate. This fostered a huge economic and social development. Intensive agriculture is a main activity, although tourism plays currently an increasing economic role in the coasts. Many aquifers are relatively high yielding small carbonate units where the total groundwater level drawdown may currently exceed 300 m. Groundwater storage depletion is estimated about 15 km(3). This volume is close to the total contribution of the Tagus-Segura water transfer, but without large investments paid for with public funds. Seawater desalination complements urban supply and part of cash crop cultivation. Reclaimed urban waste water is used for irrigation. Groundwater mining produces benefits but associated to sometimes serious economic, administrative, legal and environmental problems. The use of an exhaustible vital resource raises ethical concerns. It cannot continue under the current legal conditions. A progressive change of water use paradigm is the way out, but this is not in the mind of most water managers and politicians. The positive and negative results observed in south-eastern Spain may help to analyse other areas under similar hydrogeological conditions in a less advanced stage of water use evolution.

AB  - Intensive exploitation and continuous consumption of groundwater reserves (groundwater mining) have been real facts for decades in arid and semiarid areas. A summary of experience in the hydrogeological, economic, social and ethical consequences of groundwater intensive and mining exploitation in Gran Canaria and Tenerife Islands, in the Canarian Archipelago, is presented. Groundwater abstraction is less than recharge, but a significant outflow of groundwater to the sea cannot be avoided, especially in Tenerife, due to its younger volcanic coastal formations. Consequently, the intensive aquifer groundwater development by means of wells and water galleries (tunnels) has produced a groundwater reserve depletion of about 2 km(3). Should current groundwater abstraction cease, the recovery time to close-to-natural conditions is from decades to one century, except in the mid and high elevations of Tenerife, where this recovery is not possible as aquifer formations will remain permanently drained by the numerous long water galleries. The socio-economic circumstances are complex due to a long standing history of water resources exploitation, successive social changes on each island, and well-established groundwater water trading, with complex relationships that affect water governance and the resulting ethical concerns. Gran Canaria and Tenerife are in an advanced groundwater exploitation stage and have a large water demand. They are good examples that allow drawing guidelines to evaluate groundwater development on other small high islands. After presenting the hydrogeological background, the socio-economic results are discussed to derive general knowledge to guide on water governance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regions vary in their supply of and access to ground and surface waters. These two issues together have substantial influence on the pressures and drivers of water conservation adoption (i.e., necessity vs voluntary adoption). A framework for water use models is proposed where regions are evaluated on two continua, infrastructure (engineered and political) and freshwater supply (physical and usable). Eight illustrative regions are placed into four quadrants based on water-related infrastructure and supply. Regions in quadrant I experience both ample water supply and adequate infrastructure to still be operating with conservation as a 'luxury.' Regions falling within quadrants II and IV experience a shortage of either supply (II) or infrastructure (IV) but adequate levels of the opposite factor. Regions falling within quadrant III bear the double burden of limited supply and infrastructure. Shifts in quadrants are examined as a function of movement along infrastructure and supply axes. This study seeks to answer (1) for a region with both ample supply and sufficient access to freshwater, what are the mechanisms by which the situation will degrade; (2) for regions lacking either supply or infrastructure (or both) what are the mechanisms by which the situation can be improved; and (3) how do regions maintain status in preferred quadrants?

AB  - After the reunion of North and South Vietnam in 1975, the area under small-holder, irrigated cultivation of Coffea canephora increased by a factor of 10 in the Central Highlands. The actual acreage under coffee in Dak Lak province is estimated to be over 260,000 ha, representing 60% of the national production, with 405,000 t per year for the world market. Vietnam is presently the second largest exporter worldwide and expansion is still going on. In response to farmers' alarming reports of apparent water scarcity in the dry season, this paper assesses the groundwater recharge in the Ea Tul watershed, a representative area in the Central Highlands region. The groundwater recharge is estimated by means of a steady-state, water balance model and validated by means of historical data, stream gauge records at the basin's outlet and groundwater level fluctuations in wells nearby the study area. To account for the variability from one year to another, the input of the water balance equation was subjected to a frequency analysis. The estimates indicate that the expected annual groundwater recharge is 743 mm in a wet year, 517 mm in an average and 361 mm in a dry year. Validation and literature reviews confirm these figures. Subsequently the model is used to evaluate the issue of aquifer depletion and to verify whether a combination of optimal irrigation management and optimal land allocation for Robusta coffee could solve the apparent water shortages in the coffee sector. Allowing for a minimum river discharge under very dry circumstances (i.e. the Q(90) of river base flow), the sustainable yield from the aquifer for variable climatic conditions is calculated. The results confirm that with the present irrigation application depths, the groundwater is likely to be depleted in dry years, but not in wet and average years. Reducing the irrigation application depths could keep the groundwater balance positive in all years. Optimization of land allocation for C canephora may offer an alternative way out. A reduction by 35% of the present coffee area in Ea Tul along with irrigation efficiency improvement could keep the groundwater resources in balance and guarantees a minimum river discharge, even during severe dry seasons.

AB  - Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is an emerging sustainable technique that has already generated successful results and is expected to solve many water resource problems, especially in semi-arid and arid zones. It is of great interest for karst aquifers that currently supply 20-25% of the world's potable water, particularly in Mediterranean countries. However, the high heterogeneity in karst aquifers is too complex to be able to locate and describe them simply via field observations. Hence, as compared to projects in porous media, MAR is still marginal in karst aquifers. Accordingly, the present work presents a conceptual methodology for Aquifer Rechargeability Assessment in Karst - referred to as ARAK. The methodology was developed noting that artificial recharge in karst aquifers is considered an improbable challenge to solve since karst conduits may drain off recharge water without any significant storage, or recharge water may not be able to infiltrate. The aim of the ARAK method is to determine the ability of a given karst aquifer to be artificially recharged and managed, and the best sites for implementing artificial recharge from the surface. ARAK is based on multi-criteria indexation analysis modeled on karst vulnerability assessment methods. ARAK depends on four independent criteria, i.e. Epikarst, Rock, Infiltration and Karst. After dividing the karst domain into grids, these criteria are indexed using geological and topographic maps refined by field observations. ARAK applies a linear formula that computes the intrinsic rechargeability index based on the indexed map for every criterion, coupled with its attributed weighting rate. This index indicates the aptitude for recharging a given karst aquifer, as determined by studying its probability first on a regional scale for the whole karst aquifer, and then by characterizing the most favorable sites. Subsequently, for the selected sites, a technical and economic feasibility factor is applied, weighted by the difficulties that could occur when trying to undertake a recharge operation at a selected site from the surface. Each site is finally rated by its rechargeability index - the product of two factors, the intrinsic rechargeability and the feasibility index. ARAK was applied to the region of Damour, Lebanon, on the Mediterranean coast where uncontrolled exploitation of public and private wells led to its partial salinization by seawater. A MAR system in Damour region represents an interesting solution to cope with salinization and the insufficiency of the resource. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We employ a climate-driven hydrological water balance and sediment transport model (HydroTrend) to simulate future climate-driven sediment loads flowing into the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) mega-delta. The model was parameterised using high-quality topographic data and forced with daily temperature and precipitation data obtained from downscaled Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations for the period 1971-2100. Three perturbed RCM model runs were selected to quantify the potential range of future climate conditions associated with the SRES A1B scenario. Fluvial sediment delivery rates to the GBM delta associated with these climate data sets are projected to increase under the influence of anthropogenic climate change, albeit with the magnitude of the increase varying across the two catchments. Of the two study basins, the Brahmaputra's fluvial sediment load is predicted to be more sensitive to future climate change. Specifically, by the middle part of the 21st century, our model results suggest that sediment loads increase (relative to the 1981-2000 baseline period) over a range of between 16% and 18% (depending on climate model run) for the Ganges, but by between 25% and 28% for the Brahmaputra. The simulated increase in sediment flux emanating from the two catchments further increases towards the end of the 21st century, reaching between 34% and 37% for the Ganges and between 52% and 60% for the Brahmaputra by the 2090s. The variability in these changes across the three climate change simulations is small compared to the changes, suggesting they represent a significant increase. The new data obtained in this study offer the first estimate of whether and how anthropogenic climate change may affect the delivery of fluvial sediment to the GBM delta, informing assessments of the future sustainability and resilience of one of the world's most vulnerable mega-deltas. Specifically, such significant increases in future sediment loads could increase the resilience of the delta to sea-level rise by giving greater potential for vertical accretion. However, these increased sediment fluxes may not be realised due to uncertainties in the monsoon related response to climate change or other human-induced changes in the catchment: this is a subject for further research.

AB  - The world's rivers deliver 19 billion tonnes of sediment to the coastal zone annually(1), with a considerable fraction being sequestered in large deltas, home to over 500 million people. Most (more than 70 per cent) large deltas are under threat from a combination of rising sea levels, ground surface subsidence and anthropogenic sediment trapping(2,3), and a sustainable supply of fluvial sediment is therefore critical to prevent deltas being ` drowned' by rising relative sea levels(2-4). Here we combine suspended sediment load data from the Mekong River with hydrological model simulations to isolate the role of tropical cyclones in transmitting suspended sediment to one of the world's great deltas. We demonstrate that spatial variations in the Mekong's suspended sediment load are correlated (r = 0.765, P < 0.1) with observed variations in tropical-cyclone climatology, and that a substantial portion (32 per cent) of the suspended sediment load reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated by rainfall associated with tropical cyclones. Furthermore, we estimate that the suspended load to the delta has declined by 52.6 +/- 10.2 megatonnes over recent years (1981-2005), of which 33.0 +/- 7.1 megatonnes is due to a shift in tropical-cyclone climatology. Consequently, tropical cyclones have a key role in controlling the magnitude of, and variability in, transmission of suspended sediment to the coast. It is likely that anthropogenic sediment trapping in upstream reservoirs is a dominant factor in explaining past(5-7), and anticipating future(8,9), declines in suspended sediment loads reaching the world's major deltas. However, our study shows that changes in tropical-cyclone climatology affect trends in fluvial suspended sediment loads and thus are also key to fully assessing the risk posed to vulnerable coastal systems.

AB  - We evaluate links between climate and simulated river bank erosion for one of the world's largest rivers, the Mekong. We employ a process-based model to reconstruct multidecadal time series of bank erosion at study sites within the Mekong's two main hydrological response zones, defining a new parameter, accumulated excess runoff (AER), pertinent to bank erosion. We employ a hydrological model to isolate how snowmelt, tropical storms and monsoon precipitation each contribute to AER and thus modeled bank erosion. Our results show that melt (23.9% at the upstream study site, declining to 11.1% downstream) and tropical cyclones (17.5% and 26.4% at the upstream and downstream sites, respectively) both force significant fractions of bank erosion on the Mekong. We also show (i) small, but significant, declines in AER and hence assumed bank erosion during the 20th century, and; (ii) that significant correlations exist between AER and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Of these modes of climate variability, we find that IOD events exert a greater control on simulated bank erosion than ENSO events; but the influences of both ENSO and IOD when averaged over several decades are found to be relatively weak. However, importantly, relationships between ENSO, IOD, and AER and hence inferred river bank erosion are not time invariant. Specifically, we show that there is an intense and prolonged epoch of strong coherence between ENSO and AER from the early 1980s to present, such that in recent decades derived Mekong River bank erosion has been more strongly affected by ENSO.

AB  - Optimization-based models for simulation of the drainage systems are formulated and solved with a finite-difference approximated Richard's equation as an embedded constraint. The solution methodology minimizes the sum of absolute violations off the discretized variably saturated porous media flow equations. The optimal design minimizes the sum of the pressure heads to obtain optimal drain locations and discharges for a given lateral spacing. The projected augmented Lagrangian method of nonlinear programming is used to solve the optimization models. The performance of the simulation is verified using the steady-state square embankment drainage problem. Thereafter, the simulation and design models are solved for a hypothetical tile drainage system. The results demonstrate the capability of the models.

AB  - Two mathematical models for Parameter estimation in closed-loop, open-channel flow networks are presented. The parameter estimation models seek to determine the parameter values that would reproduce an observed flow profile in the channel network. The governing equations for gradually varied flow in channel networks are the optimization models' constraints. The projected augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the optimization models. Performance of these two optimization models is evaluated for a given closed-loop network configuration. Results establish the potential of the developed models for use in real-life flow scenarios.

AB  - This paper presents the state-of-the-art on application of optimisation techniques in groundwater quality and quantity management. In order to solve optimisation-based groundwater management models, researchers have used various mathematical programming techniques such as linear programming (LP), nonlinear programming (NLP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), optimal control theory-based mathematical programming, differential dynamic programming (DDP), stochastic programming (SP), combinatorial optimisation (CO), and multiple objective programming for multipurpose management. Studies reported in the literature on the application of these methods are reviewed in this paper.

AB  - Seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers is generally three dimensional (3-D) in nature. In the literature, there is a general lack of reported results on 3-D simulations. This paper presents some typical example simulations of 3-D seawater intrusion process for a specified hypothetical study area. The simulation results presented in this paper are based on the density-dependent miscible flow and transport modelling approach for simulation of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. A nonlinear optimization-based simulation methodology was used in this study. Various steady state simulations are performed for a specified study area. Response evaluations consider the effects of vertical recharge on seawater intrusion, effects of boundary conditions, and effects of spatially varying pumping from the aquifer. The 3-D simulations demonstrate the viability of using a planned strategy of spatially varying withdrawals from the aquifer to manage seawater intrusion. It is demonstrated that series of pumps near the ocean-face boundary induce a hydraulic head distribution that can be effectively used for controlling seawater intrusion.

AB  - The saltwater intrusion in a coastal aquifer is a highly complex and nonlinear process. The management of coastal aquifers requires careful planning of withdrawal strategies for control and remediation of saltwater intrusion. Prediction and control of future saltwater distribution in coastal aquifer may be possible by simulating the processes utilizing mathematical models. A finite element based flow and transport simulation model is implemented for a coastal aquifer in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The model is calibrated for two years of time period between July 2000 and July 2002, both in terms of hydraulic heads and salt concentration. The calibrated model is validated for next two years in terms of head and salt concentration with the available data for July 2002 and July 2004. The limited data availability in this study area may represent a typical real life situation. The calibrated and partially validated simulation model is used to evaluate the effectiveness of planned pumping strategies to locally control the saltwater intrusion in the study area. These limited evaluations show the potential for using a planned pumping strategy and therefore hydraulic control measures to affect the saltwater intrusion process. These simulations are also useful for evolving planned pumping strategies for control of saltwater intrusion in a coastal aquifer.

AB  - Most surface water bodies (i.e., streams, lakes, etc.) are connected to the groundwater system to some degree so that changes to surface water bodies (either diversions or importations) can change flows in aquifer systems, and pumping from an aquifer can reduce discharge to, or induce additional recharge from streams, springs, and lakes. The timescales of these interactions are often very long (decades), making sustainable management of these systems difficult if relying only on observations of system responses. Instead, management scenarios are often analyzed based on numerical modeling. In this paper we propose a framework and metrics that can be used to relate the Theis concepts of capture to sustainable measures of stream-aquifer systems. We introduce four concepts: Sustainable Capture Fractions, Sustainable Capture Thresholds, Capture Efficiency, and Sustainable Groundwater Storage that can be used as the basis for developing metrics for sustainable management of stream-aquifer systems. We demonstrate their utility on a hypothetical stream-aquifer system where pumping captures both streamflow and discharge to phreatophytes at different amounts based on pumping location. In particular, Capture Efficiency (CE) can be easily understood by both scientists and non-scientist alike, and readily identifies vulnerabilities to sustainable stream-aquifer management when its value exceeds 100%.

AB  - Overexploitation of groundwater reserves is a major environmental problem around the world. In many river basins, groundwater and surface water are used conjunctively and joint optimization strategies are required. A hydroeconomic modeling approach is used to find cost-optimal sustainable surface water and groundwater allocation strategies for a river basin, given an arbitrary initial groundwater level in the aquifer. A simplified management problem with conjunctive use of scarce surface water and groundwater under inflow and recharge uncertainty is presented. Because of head-dependent groundwater pumping costs the optimization problem is nonlinear and non-convex, and a genetic algorithm is used to solve the one-step-ahead subproblems with the objective of minimizing the sum of immediate and expected future costs. A real-world application in the water-scarce Ziya River basin in northern China is used to demonstrate the model capabilities. Persistent overdraft from the groundwater aquifers on the North China Plain has caused declining groundwater levels. The model maps the marginal cost of water in different scenarios, and the minimum cost of ending groundwater overdraft in the basin is estimated to be CNY5.58 billion yr(-1). The study shows that it is cost-effective to slowly recover the groundwater aquifer to a level close to the surface, while gradually lowering the groundwater value to the equilibrium at CNY2.15 m(-3). The model can be used to guide decision-makers to economic efficient long-term sustainable management of groundwater and surface water resources.

AB  - In many discussions, work force is mentioned as the most important factor of production. Principally, work force is a factor which can compensate for the physical and material limitations and shortcomings of other factors to a large extent which can help increase the production level. On the other hand, employment is considered as an effective factor in social issues. The goal of the present research is the allocation of water resources so as to maximize the number of jobs created in the industry and agriculture sectors. An objective that has attracted the attention of policy makers involved in water supply and distribution is the maximization of the interests of beneficiaries and consumers in case of certain policies adopted. The present model applies the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in order to determine the optimum amount of water allocated to each water-demanding sector, area under cultivation, agricultural production, employment in the agriculture sector, industrial production and employment in the industry sector. Based on the results obtained from this research, by optimally allocating water resources in the central desert region of Iran, 1096 jobs can be created in the industry and agriculture sectors, which constitutes an improvement of about 13% relative to the previous situation (non optimal water utilization). It is also worth mentioning that by optimizing the employment factor as a social parameter, the other areas such as the economic sector are influenced as well. For example, in this investigation, the resulting economic benefits (incomes) have improved from 73 billion Rials at baseline employment figures to 112 billion Rials in the case of optimized employment condition. Therefore, it is necessary to change the inter-sector and intra-sector water allocation models in this region, because this change not only leads to more jobs in this area, but also causes an improvement in the region's economic conditions.

AB  - In the Nile Valley and Delta the protection of groundwater resources is high priority environmental concern. Many groundwater quality problems are already dispersed and may be widespread and frequent in occurrence. Examples include problems associated with the extensive application of chemical fertilizers in agricultural specially in the new reclaimed areas, leaks in sewers, septic tanks, the aggregate effects of many different points source pollution in urban areas and natural, geologically related water quality problems. A national groundwater quality monitoring has been designed and implemented based on the stepwise procedure. The national groundwater quality monitoring network is used to quantify the quality changes in long run, either caused by pollution activities or by salt water intrusion and to describe the overall current groundwater quality status on a national scale of the main aquifers. The monitoring tools and methodologies developed in this research can be used to assure protection of public health and determine the sustainability of groundwater in various purposes. This national monitoring network plays important roles for decision makers in developing the groundwater resources management plans in different aquifers systems in Egypt.

AB  - The limited availability of renewable fresh water is a major constraint on future agriculture and urban development in Egypt. The main water resource that Egypt has been depending on is the River Nile. Nowadays, the role of groundwater is steadily increasing and will cover 20% of the total water supply in the coming decades especially in the reclaimed areas along the desert fringes of the Nile Delta and Valley. Abstraction from groundwater in Egypt is dynamic in nature as it grows rapidly with the expansion of irrigation activities, industrialization, and urbanization. One of these areas is the Western Nile Delta in which the groundwater is exploited in many localities. To avoid the deterioration of the aquifer system in this area, an efficient integrated and sustainable management plan for groundwater resources is needed. Efficient integrated and sustainable management of water resources relies on a comprehensive database that represents the characteristics of the aquifer system and modeling tools to achieve the impacts of decision alternatives. In this paper, a GIS-based model has been developed for the aquifer system of the Western Nile Delta. The GIS provides the utilization of analytical tools and visualization capabilities for pre-and post-processing information involved in groundwater modeling for the study area. The developed model was calibrated for steady state and transient conditions against the historical groundwater heads observed during the last 20 yr. The calibrated model was used to evaluate groundwater potentiality and to test two alternative management scenarios for conserving the aquifer system in Western Nile Delta. In the first scenario, reducing the surface water inflow while increasing the annual abstraction from groundwater by about 450 million m(3) and improving the irrigation system could increase the net aquifer recharge by about 5.7% and reduce the aquifer potentiality by about 91%. Constructing a new canal as a second management scenario could increase the annual aquifer potentiality by about 23%. The GIS-based model has been proven to be an efficient tool for formulating integrated and sustainable management plan.

AB  - This paper presents a review on the integration of hydrological, ecological and hydrogeological processes into Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) practice. These processes, for example, interact and take part in the process of creation of groundwater-related wetlands, which are an important part of the Earth's biodiversity. Tools for integrating water and ecosystems are presented, with emphasis on the hydrogeological aspects as often they are poorly considered. Recent pioneering projects (IGCP-604, UNESCO-IHP, GENESIS, and Groundwater Governance) developed models for the future integration of ecosystem health with groundwater exploitation. An IWRM approach where groundwater-related wetlands and the groundwater systems upon which they depend are included in conjunctive water management decisions can be an accepted and workable paradigm that will benefit present and future generations.

AB  - Models have been used by man for thousands of years to control his environment in a favorable way to better human living conditions. The use of hydrologic models has been a widely effective tool in order to support decision makers dealing with watersheds related to several economic and social activities, like public water supply, energy generation, and water availability for agriculture, among others. The purpose of this review is to briefly discuss some models on soil and water movement on landscapes (RUSLE, WEPP, GeoWEPP, LASH, DHSVM and AnnAGNPS) to provide information about them to help and serve in a proper manner in order to discuss particular problems related to hydrology and soil erosion processes. Models have been changed and evaluated significantly in recent years, highlighting the use of remote sense, GIS and automatic calibration process, allowing them capable of simulating watersheds under a given land-use and climate change effects. However, hydrology models have almost the same physical structure, which is not enough for simulating problems related to the long-term effects of different land-uses. That has been our challenge for next future: to understand entirely the hydrology cycle, having as reference the critical zone, in which the hydrological processes act together from canopy to the bottom of aquifers.

AB  - The physical interconnection of ground and surface waters is rarely acknowledged in inter-state and international agreements over surface water. This is especially true in the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo basin, where groundwater pumping is at the heart of several disputes and legal cases related to compliance with intergovernmental water agreements. This research considers the Upper and Middle Rio Grande basin to explore how groundwater use and management interact with interstate (i.e. intranational within the US) and international relations (US-Mexico). We consider three distinct geographic regions to address the following questions: how have intergovernmental surface water agreements affected local groundwater management and policies? And, how does groundwater management at local scale influence intergovernmental relations over water? We combine documentary data and interview data collected through extensive fieldwork during 2016 and 2017. The analysis reveals the emergence of both state-driven and community-based groundwater initiatives aimed at reconciling needs and obligations stemming from different geographical and institutional levels. The analysis uncovers strong institutional interplay across water management levels and suggests that compliance with intergovernmental agreements in federal and international contexts both affects and is affected by local groundwater management. Moreover, we observed that while local water managers are sometimes prevented from solving problems locally due to interstate rules, opportunities for innovation in local groundwater governance can also be triggered by compliance obligations at other levels.

AB  - Rainwater harvesting is a well-established practice in many parts of the world. In the right environment it can provide a convenient, inexpensive and sustainable source of potable water. This study explored rainwater collecting system use within rural Trinidadian communities. Data regarding participants' demographic details, water practices, health- and water-related beliefs were collected from six separate regions late in 2009 using a purpose designed questionnaire. The findings, obtained from the 1,523 study participants resident in 292 households were analysed. Almost half (130) of the participating households utilised rainwater as their main supply although some found it necessary to switch to alternative sources during dry periods. The majority of participants (478) who harvested rainwater were very satisfied with the quality of their water and relatively few (212) were concerned that it may pose a risk to their health. Rainwater harvesting systems are well established in Trinidad and are well accepted by those who use them. Further research is needed to establish why more households do not adopt this technology as alternative sources remain inconsistent and inadequate in many respects. These findings will assist individuals and government agencies in making informed decisions when planning and managing water sources on the island.

AB  - Urban centres increasingly have difficulties meeting water needs within their hydrologic basins. To sustain urban water supply, cities and water source regions have increased telecouplings (socio-economic and environmental interactions over distances). To analyse these complex interactions, we apply the new telecoupling framework to the water-stressed megacity of Beijing's imported water supply. We found that Beijing's remote water sources have lower risk than local supply, but connections impact the sending systems. The telecoupling framework provides a standard, systematic and flexible tool for evaluating the sustainability of urban water supply. It also identifies a number of research gaps for future quantification efforts.

AB  - Numerical models are now commonly used to define guidelines for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. Despite significant advances in inverse modeling and uncertainty analysis, most of groundwater management models are still calibrated by manual trial and error and disregard predictive uncertainty. There is a gap between recent advances in inverse modeling and current practices in operational groundwater modeling. The disinterest of water practitioners for this issue can be explained by unawareness, lack of relevant and reliable datasets, difficulties of implementation and prohibitive computation times. The purpose of this study is to convince water practitioners and water managers that uncertainty analysis is not just a smart, optional add-on to a groundwater model, but rather a critical and necessary step. So as to broaden the audience of this paper out of the community of specialists, we use a simple didactic illustration and propose realistic, practical solutions. Based on a synthetic model, we highlight that if we follow common practices (parameter calibration solely against observed groundwater heads), our knowledge of the unknown parameters is not sufficient to constrain the predicted value of interest (the sustainable yield). This is a critical issue since management models are likely to be used for the design of legal frameworks. After this illustration, we argue that calibration algorithms should become a routine process to bring the uncertainty analysis to the forefront. We promote the use of a linear uncertainty analysis as a diagnostic tool for large real world groundwater management models. When uncertainty is high, stakeholders should encourage the collection of multiple data sets to expand the calibration data set and gather prior information on parameter values.

Here, a joint approach combining an aquifer test with application of the water-table fluctuation (WTF) method is presented to estimate these parameters and quantify their uncertainty. The approach requires two wells: an observation well instrumented with a pressure probe for long-term monitoring and a pumping well, located in the vicinity, for the aquifer test. The derivative of observed drawdown levels highlights the necessity to represent delayed drainage from the unsaturated zone when interpreting the aquifer test results. Groundwater recharge is estimated with an event-based WTF method in order to minimize the transient effects of flow dynamics in the unsaturated zone. The uncertainty on groundwater recharge is obtained by the propagation of the uncertainties on specific yield (Bayesian inference) and groundwater recession dynamics (regression analysis) through the WTF equation. A major portion of the uncertainty on groundwater recharge originates from the uncertainty on the specific yield. The approach was applied to a site in Bordeaux (France). Groundwater recharge was estimated to be 335mm with an associated uncertainty of 86.6mm at 2 sigma. By the use of cost-effective instrumentation and parsimonious methods of interpretation, the replication of such a joint approach should be encouraged to provide reliable estimates of specific yield and groundwater recharge over a region of interest. This is necessary to reduce the predictive uncertainty of groundwater management models.

AB  - A comprehensive conventional hydrological and hydrogeological study was conducted in two topographically closed crater takes in the northeastern highlands of Ethiopia. Particular emphasis is given to the estimation of the water balance and assessment of groundwater and surface water interactions. The detailed bathymetric map of the takes has also been established for the first time. The result revealed the importance of both groundwater and surface water components in the water balance of the takes. Field hydrogeological observations and the conventional water balance indicate outflow and inflow of groundwater from both Lakes. The takes leak groundwater through large faults, which also control the occurrence and distribution of springs. The leakage of the takes through faults is independently validated by hydrochemical analysis; indicating lower ionic concentration and freshness of both takes in contrast with closed terminal takes, which are commonly characterized by higher salinity. Limited environmental isotopes together with major ion analysis revealed that shallow fresh groundwater recharged from highland rainfall is one of the main driving forces of the hydrology of the takes and their catchments. There is no indication of deep groundwater with high ionic concentration and residence time that feeds the takes. From erratic take level record and bathymetric survey, it was found that take Hayq has declined in level over the last 60 years. But, recently due to human influences (return flow from irrigation), the Level has shown slight rise at the expense of the leaking take Ardibo located at relatively higher topographic position. These recent anthropogenic influences demand careful assessment of the complex nature of the hydrology and the water balance. In this regard, this study is believed to have laid the foundation for future detailed work that may help for sustainable water management practise. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are many hydrological models, some of which can be used for forested environments. This review aims to compare ten of these models (BILJOU, EPIC, BROOK90, SWAT, RHESSys, MIKE SHE, SHETRAN, WaSiM ETH, DHSVM and Hydrus) in order to provide guidance in the choice of model. The comparison of the models focuses on the following forest fluxes: interception, transpiration and root water uptake, root distribution, the understory effect, tree growth and model validation. The review underlines the fact that each model deals with forest fluxes in a different way. Most of the models deal with interception in a similar way, and root distribution is used in the process of root water uptake. Understory and growth are seldom considered.

AB  - The western United States is a region long defined by water challenges. Climate change adds to those historical challenges, but does not, for the most part, introduce entirely new challenges; rather climate change is likely to stress water supplies and resources already in many cases stretched to, or beyond, natural limits. Projections are for continued and, likely, increased warming trends across the region, with a near certainty of continuing changes in seasonality of snowmelt and streamflows, and a strong potential for attendant increases in evaporative demands. Projections of future precipitation are less conclusive, although likely the northernmost West will see precipitation increases while the southernmost West sees declines. However, most of the region lies in a broad area where some climate models project precipitation increases while others project declines, so that only increases in precipitation uncertainties can be projected with any confidence. Changes in annual and seasonal hydrographs are likely to challenge water managers, users, and attempts to protect or restore environmental flows, even where annual volumes change little. Other impacts from climate change (e.g., floods and water-quality changes) are poorly understood and will likely be location dependent. In this context, four iconic river basins offer glimpses into specific challenges that climate change may bring to the West. The Colorado River is a system in which overuse and growing demands are projected to be even more challenging than climate-change-induced flow reductions. The Rio Grande offers the best example of how climate-change-induced flow declines might sink a major system into permanent drought. The Klamath is currently projected to face the more benign precipitation future, but fisheries and irrigation management may face dire straits due to warming air temperatures, rising irrigation demands, and warming waters in a basin already hobbled by tensions between endangered fisheries and agricultural demands. Finally, California's Bay-Delta system is a remarkably localized and severe weakness at the heart of the region's trillion-dollar economy. It is threatened by the full range of potential climate-change impacts expected across the West, along with major vulnerabilities to increased flooding and rising sea levels.

AB  - [ 1] Micrometeorological measurements of evapotranspiration ( ET) can be difficult to interpret and use for validating model calculations in the presence of land cover heterogeneity. Land surface fluxes, soil moisture (theta), and surface temperatures (T(s)) data were collected by an eddy correlation-based tower located at the Orroli ( Sardinia) experimental field ( covered by woody vegetation, grass, and bare soil) from April 2003 to July 2004. Two Quickbird high-resolution images ( summer 2003 and spring 2004) were acquired for depicting the contrasting land cover components. Aprocedure is presented for estimating ET in heterogeneous ecosystems as the residual term of the energy balance using Ts observations, a two-dimensional footprint model, and the Quickbird images. Two variations on the procedure are successfully implemented: a proposed two-source random model (2SR), which treats the heat sources of each land cover component separately but computes the bulk heat transfer coefficient as spatially homogeneous, and a common two-source tile model. For 2SR, new relationships between the interfacial transfer coefficient and the roughness Reynolds number are estimated for the two bare soil - woody vegetation and grass - woody vegetation composite surfaces. The ET versus theta relationships for each land cover component were also estimated, showing that that the woody vegetation has a strong tolerance to long droughts, transpiring at rates close to potential for even the driest conditions. Instead, the grass is much less tolerant to theta deficits, and the switch from grass to bare soil following the rainy season had a significant impact on ET.

AB  - India is a poster child for groundwater depletion and chronic water stress. Often, water sustainability is measured through an estimate of the difference between the average supply and demand in a region. However, water supply and demand are highly variable in time and space. Hence, measures of scarcity need to reflect temporal imbalances even for a fixed location. We introduce spatially distributed indices of water stress that integrate over time variations in water supply and demand. The indices reflect the maximum cumulative deficit in a regional water balance within year and across years. This can be interpreted as the amount that needs to be drawn from external storage (either aquifers or surface reservoirs or interarea transfers) to meet the current demand pattern given a variable climate and renewable water supply. A simulation over a long period of record (historical or projected) provides the ability to quantify risk. We present an application at a district level in India considering more than a 100 year data set of rainfall as the renewable supply, and the recent water use pattern for each district. Consumption data are available through surveys at the district level, and consequently, we use this rather than river basins as the unit of analysis. The rainfall endogenous to each district is used as a potentially renewable water supply to reflect the supply-demand imbalances directly at the district level, independent of potential transfers due to upstream-induced runoff or canals. The index is useful for indicating whether small or large surface storage will suffice, or whether the extent of groundwater storage or external transfers, or changes in demand are needed to achieve a sustainable solution. Implications of the analysis for India and for other applications are discussed.

AB  - Sustainability and sustainable pumping are two different concepts that are often used interchangeably. The latter term refers to a pumping rate that can be maintained indefinitely without mining an aquifer, whereas the former term is broader and concerns such issues as ecology and water quality, among others, in addition to sustainable pumping. Another important difference between the two concepts is that recharge can be very important to consider when assessing sustainability, but is not necessary to estimate sustainable pumping rates. Confusion over this distinction is made worse by the Water Budget Myth, which comprises the mistaken yet persistent ideas that (1) sustainable pumping rates cannot exceed virgin recharge rates in aquifers, and (2) that virgin recharge rates must therefore be known to estimate sustainable pumping rates. Analysis of the water balance equation shows the special circumstances that must apply for the Water Budget Myth to be true. However, due to the effects recharge is likely to have on water quality, ecology, socioeconomic factors, and, under certain circumstances, its requirement for numerical modeling, it remains important in assessments of sustainability.

AB  - Ophiolites are found all over the world: from the Alps to the Himalayas, in Cuba, Papua-New Guinea, New Caledonia, Newfoundland, etc. They are composed of hard rocks-basalt, dolerite, gabbro and peridotite, which are formed at the mid-oceanic ridges, with specific ridge-related tectonic fracturing and intense hydrothermal alteration. Their geological and thus their hydrogeological properties differ from those of both granite or "classical" gabbro and "classical" basaltic lava. A conceptual hydrogeological model of these hard-rock aquifers was developed based on the convergent results of a multidisciplinary approach at several spatial scales, from rock-sample (centimetre) to catchment (kilometre), on well-preserved ophiolite rocks in Oman. In ophiolite rocks, groundwater circulation takes place mostly in the fissured near-surface horizon (approximate to 50 m thick), and, to a lesser degree, in the tectonic fractures. Hydrograph analysis (Water Resour Res 34:233-240, 1977), interpretation of numerous pumping tests using both classical Theis and dual porosity models [Water Resour Res 32:2733-2745, 1996; Comput Geosci J (in press)], and mercury porosity and hydraulic conductivity lab-measurements support the aquifer parameter estimates. The hydraulic conductivity K of the fissured horizon is estimated at 10(-5) to 10(-6) m/s for gabbro and dolerite, and 10(-7) m/s for peridotite. The storage coefficient S of the peridotite aquifer is estimated at 10(-3) and appears to be controlled mainly by microcracks (20 to 100 mu m wide). Tectonic fractures in the ophiolite have similar hydrodynamic properties regardless of lithology (10(-1) T < 10<(-4) m(2)/s and 10(-1)< S < 10(-3)) though the probability of obtaining productive wells is two to three times greater in gabbro and dolerite than in peridotite. Some of the tectonic fractures produce small hydrothermal, hyperalkaline springs in the peridotite. The water budget and hydrochemistry of the Oman ophiolite are characterized and support the conceptual hydrogeological model. Despite low annual rainfall, a relatively low hydraulic conductivity and a significant storage coefficient explain why most of the streams in peridotite are perennial.

AB  - As established in the European Water Framework Directive, the development of groundwater numerical models is fundamental for adopting water management plans aimed at preserving the water resource and reducing environmental risks. In this paper, authors present a methodology for the estimation of groundwater resource of an alluvial valley, in an urban area characterized by a complex hydrostratigraphic setting and scarcity of hydrogeological data; the study area is the urban and sub-urban area of Rome (Italy). A previous, elaborated hydrostratigraphic model set the base for the development of 3D, steady state, sub-basin scale numerical model, implemented by the finite-difference code MODFLOW 2000(A (R)); the water system components were derived by elaboration of available data. The alluvial aquifer of the Tiber River Valley, which runs in the middle of the City in a NNW-SE direction, has been analyzed in detail, since it is covered by a densely populated area hosting most of Rome's historical heritage, and it is characterized by low quality geotechnical parameters. Results suggest that in areas with high hydrostratigraphic complexity and scarcity of hydrogeological data, a sub-basin scale, and steady-state numerical model can be very helpful to verify the conceptual model and reduce the uncertainty on the water budget components. The proposed steady-state model constitutes the base for future applications of transient state and local scale models, required for sustainable water management.

AB  - Water level changes have been monitored over 25 years in several temporary ponds located at different distances to a pumping area of a tourist resort fringing the Donana National Park (SW Spain). The numerical model MIKE SHE was set up to simulate pond water levels and hydroperiod fluctuations. It was calibrated for nine hydrological years and validated for two periods of eight hydrological years each to assess whether the duration of the pond wet phase (hydroperiod) significantly deviated from an expected pattern driven by rainfall and evapotranspiration. The model output indicated a satisfactory performance for all simulations. This approach provided two main conclusions: a) a long-term increasing trend in water losses on the pond water balance which has not been followed by a corresponding decreasing trend in rainfall, and b) these water losses were highest in the pond located at < 1 km to the pumping area and lowest in the pond located at a further distance (5.6 km) and at a lower altitude. Our results suggest that, in the long run, a small groundwater abstraction rate has exerted a high hydrological pressure on the closest pond to the pumping area. (C)2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Integrated Management of the Water Resources is nowadays a prerequisite for environmental preservation and economic growth. The EU Water Framework Directive provides the guidelines to develop strategies and institutions to protect and restore the water resources in both qualitative and quantitative bases. However, the implementation of the proposed measures incorporates significant difficulties arising from the lack of necessary data, the fragmented approach often followed in water management and the incomprehension of the interactions between hydrologic systems and ecological components. In this particular study, a combination of remote sensing data, hydrologic models, ecological assessment techniques, GIS software and isotopic surveys have been adopted to extensively study the water resources of Trichonis Lake catchment, in Western Greece, in order to develop management alternatives aiming at protecting ecologically significant wetlands and meeting the local irrigation demands. The management alternatives have been developed with the contribution of local authorities by redistributing the monthly water outflows from the lake according to the ecological and anthropogenic demands and comprise five plans that attempt to minimize the environmental impacts from the regional water use while maintaining the economic activities unaffected.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a survey carried out in 2010 aimed at evaluating the type and quality of the groundwater resources of the Bangui region of the Central African Republic. This work is the first step towards the development of groundwater resources in the Central African Republic in order to find alternatives to direct pumping from the Ubangi River and provide the population of the suburbs with a safer drinking water supply from deep boreholes. By combining both geological and hydrogeochemical approaches, it appears that the geology of Bangui is favourable to the development of a secure and sustainable water supply from groundwater provided that the conditions of exploitation would be constrained by the local authorities. The deep Precambrian carbonate aquifers, known as the Bimbo and Fatima formations, are identified as target resources in view of the relatively good quality of their water from the chemical point of view, and the semi-confined structure of the aquifers that prevents the mixing with shallow aquifers that are already strongly affected by domestic and industrial pollution. The main difficulty in terms of exploitation is to appreciate the depth of the resource and the more or less fractured/palaeo-karstified type of the porosity.

AB  - The Hamersley Basin, in the semi-arid Pilbara region of northwest Australia, is currently subject to increasing pressure from altered hydrology associated with mining activities as well as water abstraction for regional development. Sustainable water management across the region must be underpinned by an understanding of the factors that constrain water supply in arid zones. We measured the amount and isotopic signature of individual rainfall events over three consecutive years (2009-2011) to determine the likely processes that control surface water pools in streams and groundwater recharge across the Hamersley Basin. We also measured concentrations of ions (in particular bromide and chloride) to define and quantify sources of major recharge. Stable isotope composition of precipitation across the basin forms a Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) defined by the equation: delta H-2 = 7.03 +/- 0.17 x delta O-18 + 4.78 +/- 1.45. Thus, the slope of the LMWL was similar to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL). However, the intercept of the LMWL was significantly different to the GMWL, which is attributable to the amount or "rainout" effect. The stable isotope composition of rainfall events was highly variable and dependent on event size. However, the delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of fresh groundwater from the alluvium and fractured aquifers were similar and characterised by a very narrow range (alluvium aquifer delta O-18 -8.02 +/- 0.83 parts per thousand, delta H-2 -55.6 +/- 6.0 parts per thousand, n = 65; fractured aquifer delta O-18 -8.22 +/- 0.70%o, delta H-2 56.9 +/- 5.0 parts per thousand, n = 207). Our findings suggest that intense rainfall events of >20 mm with limited evaporation prior to infiltration contribute most to recharge. In contrast, the delta H-2 and delta O-18 values and chemical composition of the relatively saline groundwater in the terminal Fortescue Marsh suggest a combination of evaporation and cyclic drying and wetting of the marsh surface prior to recharge. Saline groundwater samples were more O-18 enriched than fresh groundwater; delta H-2 and delta O-18 values shifted to the right of the LMWL, forming a straight line with a slope of 3.58 +/- 0.20 and an intercept of -25.55 +/- 0.71 (R-2 = 0.95, p < 0.001. n = 18). The stable isotope mass balance for most of the surface water pools in the basin show significant evaporation and are highly enriched compared to underlying groundwater. We conclude that significant seepage from highly evaporated pools to groundwater is very limited. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Long-term average groundwater recharge, which is equivalent to renewable groundwater resources, is the major limiting factor for the sustainable use of groundwater. Compared to surface water resources, groundwater resources are more protected from pollution, and their use is less restricted by seasonal and inter-annual flow variations. To support water management in a globalized world, it is necessary to estimate groundwater recharge at the global scale. Here, we present a best estimate of global-scale long-term average diffuse groundwater recharge (i.e. renewable groundwater resources) that has been calculated by the most recent version of the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model WGHM (spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees, daily time steps). The estimate was obtained using two state-of-the-art global data sets of gridded observed precipitation that we corrected for measurement errors, which also allowed to quantify the uncertainty due to these equally uncertain data sets. The standard WGHM groundwater recharge algorithm was modified for semi-arid and arid regions, based on independent estimates of diffuse groundwater recharge, which lead to an unbiased estimation of groundwater recharge in these regions. WGHM was tuned against observed long-term average river discharge at 1235 gauging stations by adjusting, individually for each basin, the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and total runoff. We estimate that global groundwater recharge was 12 666 km(3)/yr for the climate normal 1961-1990, i.e. 32% of total renewable water resources. In semi-arid and arid regions, mountainous regions, permafrost regions and in the Asian Monsoon region, groundwater recharge accounts for a lower fraction of total runoff, which makes these regions particularly vulnerable to seasonal and inter-annual precipitation variability and water pollution. Average per-capita renewable groundwater resources of countries vary between 8m(3)/(capita yr) for Egypt to more than 1 millionm(3)/(capita yr) for the Falkland Islands, the global average in the year 2000 being 2091 m(3)/(capita yr). Regarding the uncertainty of estimated groundwater resources due to the two precipitation data sets, deviation from the mean is 1.1% for the global value, and less than 1% for 50 out of the 165 countries considered, between 1 and 5% for 62, between 5 and 20% for 43 and between 20 and 80% for 10 countries. Deviations at the grid scale can be much larger, ranging between 0 and 186 mm/yr.

AB  - Global-scale information on natural river flows and anthropogenic river flow alterations is required to identify areas where aqueous ecosystems are expected to be strongly degraded. Such information can support the identification of environmental flow guidelines and a sustainable water management that balances the water demands of humans and ecosystems. This study presents the first global assessment of the anthropogenic alteration of river flow regimes, in particular of flow variability, by water withdrawals and dams/reservoirs. Six ecologically relevant flow indicators were quantified using an improved version of the global water model WaterGAP. WaterGAP simulated, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree, river discharge as affected by human water withdrawals and dams around the year 2000, as well as naturalized discharge without this type of human interference. Compared to naturalized conditions, long-term average global discharge into oceans and internal sinks has decreased by 2.7% due to water withdrawals, and by 0.8% due to dams. Mainly due to irrigation, long-term average river discharge and statistical low flow Q(90) (monthly river discharge that is exceeded in 9 out of 10 months) have decreased by more than 10% on one sixth and one quarter of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland), respectively. Q(90) has increased significantly on only 5% of the land area, downstream of reservoirs. Due to both water withdrawals and reservoirs, seasonal flow amplitude has decreased significantly on one sixth of the land area, while interannual variability has increased on one quarter of the land area mainly due to irrigation. It has decreased on only 8% of the land area, in areas downstream of reservoirs where consumptive water use is low. The impact of reservoirs is likely underestimated by our study as small reservoirs are not taken into account. Areas most affected by anthropogenic river flow alterations are the Western and Central USA, Mexico, the western coast of South America, the Mediterranean rim, Southern Africa, the semi-arid and arid countries of the Near East and Western Asia, Pakistan and India, Northern China and the Australian Murray-Darling Basin, as well as some Arctic rivers. Due to a large number of uncertainties related e.g. to the estimation of water use and reservoir operation rules, the analysis is expected to provide only first estimates of river flow alterations that should be refined in the future.

AB  - Freshwater availability has been recognized as a global issue, and its consistent quantification not only in individual river basins but also at the global scale is required to support the sustainable use of water. The WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model WGHM, which is a submodel of the global water use and availability model WaterGAP 2, computes surface runoff, groundwater recharge and river discharge at a spatial resolution of 0.5degrees. WGHM is based on the best global data sets currently available, and simulates the reduction of river discharge by human water consumption. In order to obtain a reliable estimate of water availability, it is tuned against observed discharge at 724 gauging stations, which represent 50% of the global land area and 70% of the actively discharging area. For 50% of these stations, the tuning of one model parameter was sufficient to achieve that simulated and observed long-term average discharges agree within 1%. For the rest, however, additional corrections had to be applied to the simulated runoff and discharge values. WGHM not only computes the long-term average water resources of a country or a drainage basin but also water availability indicators that take into account the interannual and seasonal variability of runoff and discharge. The reliability of the modeling results is assessed by comparing observed and simulated discharges at the tuning stations and at selected other stations. The comparison shows that WGHM is able to calculate reliable and meaningful indicators of water availability at a high spatial resolution. In particular, the 90% reliable monthly discharge is simulated well. Therefore, WGHM is suited for application in global assessments related to water security, food security and freshwater ecosystems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater depletion (GWD) compromises crop production in major global agricultural areas and has negative ecological consequences. To derive GWD at the grid cell, country, and global levels, we applied a new version of the global hydrological model WaterGAP that simulates not only net groundwater abstractions and groundwater recharge from soils but also groundwater recharge from surface water bodies in dry regions. A large number of independent estimates of GWD as well as total water storage (TWS) trends determined from GRACE satellite data by three analysis centers were compared to model results. GWD and TWS trends are simulated best assuming that farmers in GWD areas irrigate at 70% of optimal water requirement. India, United States, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and China had the highest GWD rates in the first decade of the 21st century. On the Arabian Peninsula, in Libya, Egypt, Mali, Mozambique, and Mongolia, at least 30% of the abstracted groundwater was taken from nonrenewable groundwater during this time period. The rate of global GWD has likely more than doubled since the period 1960-2000. Estimated GWD of 113 km(3)/yr during 2000-2009, corresponding to a sea level rise of 0.31 mm/yr, is much smaller than most previous estimates. About 15% of the globally abstracted groundwater was taken from nonrenewable groundwater during this period. To monitor recent temporal dynamics of GWD and related water abstractions, GRACE data are best evaluated with a hydrological model that, like WaterGAP, simulates the impact of abstractions on water storage, but the low spatial resolution of GRACE remains a challenge.

AB  - In coastal areas, groundwater and aquifer systems are easily prone to pollution and contamination. Moreover, sea level rises also threaten the viability of many coastal zones and small islands. In the Shiroishi lowland plain, southwestern Kyushu Island of Japan, some environmental problems such as land subsidence and salinity intrusion due to over pumping of groundwater have long been recognized as water problems and become causes for public concern. In this study, an integrated surface and groundwater model was established and applied to the Shiroishi site to simulate groundwater flow hydraulics and predict the salinity intrusion process in the alluvial lowland plain. The simulated results show that groundwater levels in the aquifer greatly vary in response to varying climatic and pumping conditions. It is also found that sea water intrusion would be expected along the coast if the current rates of groundwater exploitation continue. Furthermore, sea water intrusion with a relative rise in sea water level due to aquifer compression and global climatic change was also considered. As a result, sea water intrusion appears to extend much farther in land from the coast compared to a reference case. The study also suggests a possible alternative to mitigate the inverse effects by pumping groundwater.

AB  - Conserving groundwater resource requires the construction of a dam to increase the amount of water resources while also preventing seawater intrusion. In this paper, we simulate groundwater flow regime in a combination with a subsurface dam on an island designed to ensure a proper utilization of groundwater resources. The results of this study indicate that the construction of a subsurface dam has a possibility by means of which the availability of water resources can be increased and prevent seawater intrusion. The subsurface dam constructed in Phuket of Thailand would increase 2.5 m of groundwater heads and significantly increase 57.5% of groundwater yield without causing seawater intrusion.

AB  - Identification of hydrogeologic controls on groundwater flowpaths, recharge, and salinization is often critical to the management of limited arid groundwater resources. One approach to identifying these mechanisms is a combined analysis of hydrogeologic and hydrochemical data to develop a comprehensive conceptual model of a groundwater basin. To demonstrate this technique, water samples were collected from 33 discrete vertical zone test holes in the Hueco Bolson aquifer, located within the Trans-Pecos Texas region and the primary water resource for El Paso, Texas, USA and Juarez, Mexico. These samples were analyzed for a suite of geochemical tracers and the data evaluated in light of basin hydrogeology. On the basis of delta H-2 and delta O-18 data, two regional recharge sources were recognized, one originating from western mountain-fronts and one from through-flow of the adjacent Tularosa aquifer. Chloride concentrations were strongly correlated with lithologic formations and both Cl/Br and Cl-36 ratios suggested the primary chloride source is halite dissolution within a specific lithologic unit. In contrast, sulfur isotopes indicated that most sulfate originates from Tularosa basin Permian gypsum sources. These results yielded a more comprehensive conceptual model of the basin, which suggested that chloride salinization of wells is the result of upconing of waters from the Fort Hancock formation.

AB  - The driest area of Europe is located in the south-east of Spain. In this region, water plays an essential role for the development and maintenance of the major economical engines for society, tourism and agriculture. In the coastal areas, water scarcity increases the risk of saltwater intrusion connected also to the overexploitation of aquifers. The adequate management of coastal aquifers requires to integrate climatic and hydrogeological information, but it is common to find incomplete datasets and uncertainties about the sources and sinks of water. The Torrevieja coastal aquifer gathers all these challenges with limited information available and essential questions about the aquifer functioning. The water budget has an imbalance between inputs from precipitation-irrigation return and outputs connected to water supply pumping for population and agriculture. Initial estimates indicate an annual deficit of 4.36 Mm(3) that would produce short-term changes in the hydrodynamic system. However, the aquifer has been continuously exploited for the last 30 years which indicates the necessity of reviewing the hydrogeological characteristics of the region. A set of new conceptual models has been tested with numerical models to present alternative possibilities about the hydrogeological functioning combined with the analysis of hydrochemical data. The evaluation of the conceptual models revealed that up to 75% of the groundwater being extracted could proceed from a lower aquifer that has not been monitored. The improved water budget indicated a much lower annual deficit in the Torrevieja aquifer (0.2-0.8 Mm(3)) occasionally positive in years with high precipitation but introduces new questions about the recharge and origin of groundwater in the lower aquifer. In semi-arid areas, water is crucial facing climatic change and desertification processes; in this work, it is presented how the use of numerical models combined with hydrochemical information is a useful approach to provide new perspectives and improve water management.

AB  - Water resources in the lower Mississippi River alluvial valley play a critical role in agricultural productivity due to the widespread use of irrigation during the growing season. However, the unknown specifics of surface atmosphere feedbacks in the region, along with diminishing groundwater availability and the non-sustainable trend in irrigation draws from the alluvial aquifer, makes it difficult for water resource managers to make sound decisions for future water sustainability. As a result, it is crucial to identify spatial and temporal associations between local rainfall patterns and groundwater levels to determine the influence of precipitation on regional aquifer recharge. Specifically, it is critical to define the recharge zones of the aquifer so that rainfall distribution can be used to assess potential groundwater recovery. This project addresses the issue of defining areas of recharge in the lower Mississippi River alluvial aquifer (LMRAA) through an assessment of historical precipitation variability using high-resolution radar-derived precipitation estimates. A rotated principal component analysis (RPCA) of both groundwater and precipitation data from October through April is used to define locations where aquifer levels show the greatest variability, with a stepwise regression approach used to define areas where rainfall and groundwater levels show the strongest association. Results show that the greatest recharge through direct rainfall is along the Tallahatchie River basin in the northeastern Mississippi Delta, with recharge along the periphery of the LMRAA likely a result of direct water flux from surface hydrologic features.

AB  - In Kharga Oasis (Western Desert, Egypt),,the most extensively developed oasis since 1960, groundwater is extracted from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer, one of the largest groundwater systems in Sahara Desert. To assess the sustainability of the present and future groundwater extraction for the large-scale development projects in southwestern Egypt, a regional-scale groundwater flow model with a telescoping mesh was accomplished. Based on the hydrogeological data of more than six hundred wells, the results of the steady-state simulation indicate that recent groundwater formation in the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer of Egypt is impossible. A refined grid and a groundwater flow simulation for the coming hundred years suggest that there is no real danger of groundwater depletion. However, the problem of the increasing depth to the water-table due to the drawdown in the potentiometric surfaces will become more serious in the future.

AB  - Groundwater is an important resource for multiple uses in South Africa. Hence, setting limits to its sustainable abstraction while assuring basic human needs is required. Due to prevalent data scarcity related to groundwater replenishment, which is the traditional basis for estimating groundwater availability, the present article presents a novel method for determining allocatable groundwater in quaternary (fourth order) catchments through information on streamflow. Using established methodologies for assessing baseflow, recession flow, and instream ecological flow requirement, the methodology develops a combined stepwise methodology to determine annual available groundwater storage volume using linear reservoir theory, essentially linking low flows proportionally to upstream groundwater storages. The approach was trialled for twenty-one perennial and relatively undisturbed catchments with long-term and reliable streamflow records. Using, the Desktop Reserve Model, instream flow requirements necessary to meet the present ecological state of the streams were determined, and baseflows in excess of these flows were converted into a conservative estimates of allocatable groundwater storages on an annual basis. Results show that groundwater development potential exists in fourteen of the catchments, with upper limits to allocatable groundwater volumes (including present uses) ranging from 0.02 to 3.54 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1) (0.10-11.83 mm a(-1)) per catchment. With a secured availability of these volume 75% of the years, variability between years is assumed to be manageable. A significant (R-2 = 0.88) correlation between baseflow index and the drainage time scale for the catchments underscores the physical basis of the methodology and also enables the reduction of the procedure by one step, omitting recession flow analysis. The method serves as an important complementary tool for the assessment of the groundwater part of the Reserve and the Groundwater Resource Directed Measures in South Africa and could be adapted and applied elsewhere.

AB  - Simulation of groundwater level (GWL) fluctuations is an important task in management of groundwater resources. In this study, the effect of wavelet analysis on the training of the artificial neural network (ANN), multi linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR) approaches was investigated, and the ANN, MLR and SVR along with the wavelet-ANN (WNN), wavelet-MLR (WLR) and wavelet-SVR (WSVR) models were compared in simulating one-month-ahead of GWL. The only variable used to develop the models was the monthly GWL data recorded over a period of 11 years from two wells in the Qom plain, Iran. The results showed that decomposing GWL time series into several sub-time series, extremely improved the training of the models. For both wells 1 and 2, the Meyer and Db5 wavelets produced better results compared to the other wavelets; which indicated wavelet types had similar behavior in similar case studies. The optimal number of delays was 6 months, which seems to be due to natural phenomena. The best WNN model, using Meyer mother wavelet with two decomposition levels, simulated one-month-ahead with RMSE values being equal to 0.069 in and 0.154 m for wells 1 and 2, respectively. The RMSE values for the WLR model were 0.058 m and 0.111 m, and for WSVR model were 0.136 in and 0.060 in for wells 1 and 2, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stakeholder participation is a foundation of good water governance. Good groundwater governance typically involves the co-production of knowledge about the groundwater system. Models provide a vehicle for producing this knowledge, as well as a boundary object around which scientists and stakeholders can convene the co-production process. Through co-production, stakeholders and scientific experts can engage in exchanges that create system knowledge not otherwise achievable. The process involves one-way transfer of information, active two-way conversations, and integration of multiple kinds of knowledge into shared understanding. In the Upper Santa Cruz River basin in Arizona, USA, the University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center (WRRC) convened a project aimed at providing scientific underpinnings for groundwater planning and management. This project, entitled Groundwater, Climate, and Stakeholder Engagement, serves as a case study employing the first two stages of knowledge co-production using a hydrological model. Through an iterative process that included two-way communication, stakeholders provided critical input to hydrologic modeling analyses. Acting as a bridging organization, the WRRC facilitated a co-production process, involving location-specific and transferability workshops, which resulted in new knowledge and capacity for applying the model to novel problems.

AB  - This paper examines the distribution of economic benefits from ground-water management as a consequence of underlying aquifer characteristics. The portions of an aquifer where water moves rapidly, those with high hydraulic conductivity, as well as those that receive less yearly recharge, face a more costly common-pool problem and therefore receive higher benefits from management. The introduction of management districts in Kansas is used to test the effect of underlying aquifer characteristics on changes in agricultural land value, farm size, and crop choice. A landowner in a county with hydraulic conductivity one standard deviation higher sees a relative land value increase of 5%-8% when management is implemented. Counties with lower recharge also see relative increases in land value. Changes in farm size and percentage of cropland in corn are also consistent with the proposition that the effect of management is unequal and depends on properties of the physical system.

AB  - The Dahab watershed comprises three aquifers; the alluvial Quaternary, the Early Cambrian sandstone, and the fractured Pre-Cambrian basement aquifers. The Dahab watershed is located in the southeastern part of the arid Sinai Peninsula, where low precipitation and groundwater over-exploitation deteriorate the groundwater quality in the alluvial coastal plain aquifer located downstream. Multi-isotopes including delta O-18 and delta H-2, Sr-87/Sr-86, delta Br-81 and delta B-11 coupled with groundwater geochemistry were utilized to assess the recharge source(s), water-rock interaction, and seawater mixing to aid sustainable groundwater management strategies. Br and Cl concentrations, used to measure groundwater salinity, were low in the upstream groundwater, while higher concentrations were observed in the deep drilled wells located downstream, in the main well field. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 isotopes were depleted in the upstream aquifers, but enriched in the shallow coastal aquifer, indicating slight evaporation and seawater intrusion. Higher mean values of Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta Br-81 were observed in the fresh groundwater from high in the watershed (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.707716 and delta Br-81 = + 2.05 parts per thousand), while lower mean values were observed in the saline groundwater located downstream in the main well field (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.706631 and delta Br-81 = + 0.11 parts per thousand). The cumulative mass balance mixing curves and the geochemical NETPATH model confirm the change of groundwater quality from the upper to lower watershed caused by the leaching and evaporation processes, as well as mixing with seawater. The corrected C-14 age dating and stable isotopes show that the Quaternary and Pre-Cambrian basement aquifers contain modern groundwater, while the Early Cambrian aquifer holds paleo-groundwater, which has received considerable recharge from recent precipitation. The mixing ratiosin the Quaternary coastal aquifer range between 5% and 13% seawater to 95% and 87% fresh groundwater, respectively. These results indicate that future groundwater withdrawal must be well managed in order to limit further salinization. Groundwater withdrawal from the Quaternary coastal aquifer must be below the natural average recharge in order to be sustainable.

AB  - Coastal aquifers are the main source for sustainable freshwater in many arid and semi-arid regions around the earth. In such regions, groundwater extraction far exceeds the natural replenishment rates due to additional demands on groundwater resources especially in the last few decades. The characterization of the seawater intrusion in the Baghoush area along the northwestern coast of Egypt assesses the risk of seawater intrusion for the purpose of managing the groundwater resources in coastal areas. The (SI) in the oolitic Pleistocene aquifer is affected by several natural factors, including the drainage patterns, geological structures, distance from the sea and the manipulation of groundwater. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) has been implemented to identify the geometry of the brackish/saline water interface and to map the distribution of brackish water zone floating over the denser saline water. Seven 2-D resistivity imaging profiles were conducted using a Wenner array with different electrode distance spacings. The inverse resistivity models of these profiles indicate that these profiles are composed of three zones: the upper dry zone, the middle brackish water zone, and the lower saline water zone. The thickness of the brackish groundwater zone decreases toward the sea and the resistivity decreases with depth due to increase in water salinity. Water table along these profiles decreases from south to north, which indicates that groundwater flow is from south (inland) to north (sea). Groundwater chemistry and stable isotopes were used to determine the fresh groundwater recharge source(s), to identify mixing of different groundwaters, to evaluate seawater intrusion zone along the coast, and to investigate the upwelling of deep saline groundwater underneath the brackish zone. The recharge of fresh groundwater originates from the mountain watershed located upstream as well as the annual rainfall; however, seawater is the main source of groundwater salinization. The estimated mixing ratios between the fresh groundwater recharge to seawater ranges between 32% and 75% groundwater to 68% and 25% seawater. The outcomes of this study emphasize the importance of closely monitoring groundwater management to limit upwelling of the underlying salt-water into the overlying groundwater along the coast to limit further seawater intrusion.

AB  - The Wadi Watir delta, in the arid Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, contains an alluvial aquifer underlain by impermeable Precambrian basement rock. The scarcity of rainfall during the last decade, combined with high pumping rates, resulted in degradation of water quality in the main supply wells along the mountain front, which has resulted in reduced groundwater pumping. Additionally, seawater intrusion along the coast has increased salinity in some wells. A three-dimensional (3D) groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) was calibrated using groundwater-level changes and pumping rates from 1982 to 2009; the groundwater recharge rate was estimated to be 1.58 x 10(6) m(3)/year. A variable-density flow model (SEAWAT) was used to evaluate seawater intrusion for different pumping rates and well-field locations. Water chemistry and stable isotope data were used to calculate seawater mixing with groundwater along the coast. Geochemical modeling (NETPATH) determined the sources and mixing of different groundwaters from the mountainous recharge areas and within the delta aquifers; results showed that the groundwater salinity is controlled by dissolution of minerals and salts in the aquifers along flow paths and mixing of chemically different waters, including upwelling of saline groundwater and seawater intrusion. Future groundwater pumping must be closely monitored to limit these effects.

AB  - The Quaternary coastal plain aquifer down gradient of the Wadi Watir catchment is the main source of potable groundwater in the arid region of south Sinai, Egypt. The scarcity of rainfall over the last decade, combined with high groundwater pumping rates, have resulted in water-quality degradation in the main well field and in wells along the coast. Understanding the sources of groundwater salinization and amount of average annual recharge is critical for developing sustainable groundwater management strategies for the long-term prevention of groundwater quality deterioration. A combination of geochemistry, conservative ions (Cl and Br), and isotopic tracers (Sr-87/86, delta Br-81, delta Cl-37), in conjunction with groundwater modeling, is an effective method to assess and manage groundwater resources in the Wadi Watir delta aquifers. High groundwater salinity, including high Cl and Br concentrations, is recorded inland in the deep drilled wells located in the main well field and in wells along the coast. The range of Cl/Br ratios for shallow and deep groundwaters in the delta (similar to 50-97) fall between the end member values of the recharge water that comes from the up gradient watershed, and evaporated seawater of marine origin, which is significantly different than the ratio in modern seawater (228). The Sr-87/86 and delta 81Br isotopic values were higher in the recharge water (0.70,723 < Sr-87/86 < 0.70,894, +0.94 < delta Br-81 < +1.28%), and lower in the deep groundwater (0.70,698 < Sr-87/86 < 0.70,705, +0.22% < delta Br-81 < +0.41%). The delta Cl-37 isotopic values were lower in the recharge water (-0.48 < delta Cl-37 < -0.06%) and higher in the deep groundwater (-0.01 < delta Cl-37 < +0.22%). The isotopic values of strontium, chloride, and bromide in groundwater from the Wadi Watir delta aquifers indicate that the main groundwater recharge source comes from the up gradient catchment along the main stream channel entering the delta. The solute-weighted mass balance mixing models show that groundwater in the main well field contains 4-10% deep saline groundwater, and groundwater in some wells along the coast contain 2-6% seawater and 18-29% deep saline groundwater. A three-dimensional, variable-density, flow-and-transport SEAWAT model was developed using groundwater isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86, delta Cl-37 and delta Br-81) and calibrated using historical records of groundwater level and salinity. delta O-18 was used to normalize the evaporative effect on shallow groundwater salinity for model calibration. The model shows how groundwater salinity and hydrologic data can be used in SEAWAT to understand recharge mechanisms, estimate groundwater recharge rates, and simulate the upwelling of deep saline groundwater and seawater intrusion. The model indicates that most of the groundwater recharge occurs near the outlet of the main channel. Average annual recharge to delta alluvial aquifers for 1982 to 2009 is estimated to be 2.16 x 106 m(3)/yr. The main factors that control groundwater salinity are overpumping and recharge availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable development in El Arish area of North Sinai, Egypt, is retarded by serious environmental problems, where the land-use and land cover of the region is changing over present time. The impact of human activities in the study area is accompanied by the destruction and over-exploitation of the environment. This study applies multivariate statistics (factor and cluster analyses) and GIS techniques to identify both anthropogenic and natural processes affecting the groundwater quality in the Quaternary sands aquifer. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts on groundwater resources, the potential pollution sources, and to identify the main anthropogenic inputs of both nutrients and trace metal. Since the depth to the water table is shallow especially in the northern part (< 4 m), and the aquifer was exposed on the ground surface, it has poor buffering capacity and the pollution risk is very high. Groundwater chemistry in this coastal region has complex contaminant sources, where intensive farming activities and untreated wastes put stress on groundwater quality. Several areal distribution maps were constructed for correlating water quality with possible contributing factors such as location, land-use, and aquifer depth. These maps identified both anthropogenic and natural processes affecting groundwater quality of the studied aquifer. Cluster analysis was used to classify water chemistry and determine the hydrochemical groups, Q-mode dendrogram is interpreted and there are three main clusters. Factor analyses identify the potential contamination sources affecting groundwater hydrochemistry such as: nitrate, sulfate, phosphate and potassium fertilizers, pesticides, sewage pond wastes, and salinization due to circulation of dissolved salts in the irrigation water itself.

AB  - A combination of major and trace elements have been used to characterize surface- and groundwater in El Minia district, Egypt. Surface water versus groundwater chemistry data enabled geographical zonation and chemical types to be differentiated. The main target of this research is to investigate the groundwater quality and hydrochemical evaluation. The situation is further complicated by contamination with lithogenic and anthropogenic (agricultural and sewage wastewaters) sources and low plan exploitation techniques. The investigated Pleistocene aquifer is composed of sand and gravel of different sizes, with some clay intercalation. The semi-confined condition was around the River Nile shifted to unconfine outside the floodplain. The groundwater flow generally from south to north and locally diverts towards the western part from the River Nile. Fifty-six, 11, five, and two water samples were collected from the Pleistocene aquifer, River Nile, Ibrahimia canal, and Al Moheet drain, respectively. The collected water samples were analyzed for major and trace elements. The toxic metal concentrations of Al Moheet drain are higher than those in the River Nile and the Ibrahimia canal. Cr, Hg, As, and Cd concentrations in the River Nile and Ibrahimia canal are fluctuated above and below the WHO drinking standards. Se concentration in River Nile and Ibrahimia canal is below WHO drinking and irrigation guidelines. Total dissolved solid content in groundwater is generally low, but it is increased due to the western part of the study area. The geographic position of the River Nile, Ibrahimia canal, and Al Moheet drain impact on the groundwater quality. The PHREEQC confirm the high mixing proportions from the River Nile into the groundwater and decline away from it. In addition to the thicknesses of the Pleistocene, aquifer and aquitard layer enhance the River Nile and agricultural wastewaters intrusion into the aquifer system. The toxic metal concentrations (Pb, Cd, Cr, PO4, Se, Mn, As, Hg, Ni, Al, Fe, and SIO2) in groundwater were increased mainly in the northwestern and southeastern part (far from the River Nile). It is attributed to anthropogenic, high vulnerability rate (unconfined), and partially to lithogenic. In most localities, the groundwater are unsuitable for drinking and irrigation purposes with respect to Se concentration, while they are unsuitable for dinking according Mn, As, and Hg contents. There are some Cd and Pb anomalies concentrations, which cause severe restriction if used in irrigation. The results suggested that significant changes are urgently needed in water use strategy to achieve sustainable development.

AB  - The Paris-Abu Bayan area located along the Darb El Arbaein road is involved in the New Valley Project in the Egyptian Western Desert (EWD) as part of ongoing efforts since the 1960s. In this dryland area, groundwater stored in the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) serves as the only water resource for a number of different uses. A major concern is the significant groundwater withdrawals from 74 pumped wells since the beginning of agricultural activities in 2000. The recent rapid expansion of agricultural activity and the lack of sufficient groundwater recharge as a result of unplanned groundwater development have led to severe stress on the aquifer. Field measurements have shown a rapid decline in groundwater levels, creating a crisis situation for this sole source of water in the area. In this study, mathematical modeling of the groundwater system (single aquifer layer) of the Paris-Abu Bayan reclaimed area was implemented using MODFLOW to devise a new strategy for the sustainable use of groundwater, by applying a number of scenarios in a finite-difference program. The conceptual model and calibration were developed by generating and studying the hydrogeological records, NSA parameters, production wells, and water level measurements for 2005 and 2012. Three management scenarios were applied on the calibrated model to display the present and future stresses on this aquifer over a 30-year period (2012-2042). The results clearly show a high decline in the heads of the NSA, by about 13.8 m, due to the continuous withdrawal of water (first scenario: present conditions, 102,473 m(3)/day). In the second scenario, the water level is expected to decrease significantly, by about 16 m, in most of the reclamation area by increasing the pumping rates by about 25% (over-pumping) to meet the continuous need for more cultivation land in the area. To reduce the large decline in water levels, the third plan tests the aquifer after reducing the water withdrawal by approximately 25%, applying modern irrigation systems, and suggesting two new reclaimed areas in the northeastern and northwestern parts (areas 1 and 2), with 20 new wells, at 500 m(3)/day/well. The results in this case show that groundwater levels are slightly decreased, by about 9.5 m, while many wells (especially the new wells in the northern part) show a slight decrease in groundwater levels (0.8 m). The results comparison shows that the groundwater level in the modeled area is lowered by 0.3 m/year with an increase in the number of wells to 94 and increased cultivation area by about 18% (third scenario), versus 0.45 m/year and 0.60 m/year recorded for the first and second scenarios, respectively. Therefore, based on the results, the third scenario is recommended as a new strategy for improving groundwater resource sustainability in the region.

AB  - Karst aquifers are the main groundwater resource in Lebanon as well as in most Mediterranean countries. Most of them are not exploited in a sustainable way, partly because their characteristics remain unknown. Karst aquifers are so complex that the assessment of their resource and their exploitable storage requires an analysis of their whole functioning, particularly by analysing the spring hydrograph. Among all various methods, the method proposed by Mangin aims to characterize at the same time the recharge conditions and the storage and recession of the saturated zone by analyzing the spring hydrograph. This method defines two parameters, the infiltration delay i, and the regulating power k which are the roots of a classification of karst systems. This classification makes the distinction between karst and porous aquifers considering the value of the regulating power. k is assumed to be tower than 0.5 in karst, and between 0.5 and 1 for all other aquifers, 1 being the upper limit. The study of karst aquifers in Lebanon shows values of k > 0.5, and even 1; former data from the literature show that other karst springs in Middle East have comparable characteristics. In fact, what is not considered by Mangin and others, k is equivalent to a mean residence time in years of water in the saturated zone. So Long residence times are normally observed in poorly karstified aquifers, or containing abandoned, not functioning karstification. The geological framework in which the studied springs are located in fact shows that these aquifers have been subject to a tong, complex evolution, as a consequence of the base level rising. This rising produced the flooding of the successive karst drainage network, which does not really function anymore and provides a large storage capacity to the aquifer. The very interesting properties of these aquifers make them prime targets for fulfilling the increasing needs of water. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. ALL rights reserved.

AB  - Numerical groundwater models were used to assess groundwater sustainability on Jeju Island, South Korea, for various climate and groundwater withdrawal scenarios. Sustainability criteria included groundwater-level elevation, spring flows, and salinity. The latter was studied for the eastern sector of the island where saltwater intrusion is significant. Model results suggest that there is a need to revise the current estimate of sustainable yield of 1.77 x 10(6) m(3)/day. At the maximum extraction of 84 % of the sustainable yield, a 10-year drought scenario would decrease spring flows by 28 %, dry up 27 % of springs, and decrease hydraulic head by an island-wide average of 7 m. Head values are particularly sensitive to changes in recharge in the western parts of the island, due to the relatively low hydraulic conductivity of fractured volcanic aquifers and increased groundwater extraction for irrigation. Increases in salinity are highest under drought conditions around the current 2-m head contour line, with an estimated increase of up to 9 g/L under 100 % sustainable-yield use. The study lists recommendations towards improving the island's management of potable groundwater resources. However, results should be treated with caution given the available data limitations and the simplifying assumptions of the numerical modeling approaches.

AB  - The main target of this research paper was to the hydrogeological assessment of the groundwater resources to irrigate 600 ha of irrigable agricultural lands, distributed along the Dead Sea-Aqaba Highway in Umm, Methla, Wadi Musa, Qa' Saideen and Rahma, southern Jordan. Therefore, a comprehensive groundwater study was commenced by drilling eight new wells which can be used to supply irrigable areas with the existing groundwater that would be enriched by the yield of three proposed recharge dams on Wadi Musa, Wadi Abu-Burqa, and Wadi Rahma. The evaluation of the pumping test data of the drilled was carried out using the standard methods of pumping test interpretation. This was based on the available water table measurements at well locations and knowledge of water flow in the general. The sustainable yield of each well was calculated based on the pumping test parameters. The obtained results indicate that pumping out of Beer Mathkor wells should not exceed 1,100 m(3)/day in the case of continuous pumping and 8,700 m(3)/day in the case of intermittent pumping. Since the water table did not significantly change with small changes in pumping (it took eightfolds of magnitude increase in pumping from approximately 1,100 to 8,700 m(3)/day to show a significant drop in the water table equivalent to about 5.5 MCM per year from the aquifer.

AB  - Elevation differences have been determined through conventional ground surveying techniques for over a century. Since the mid-80s GPS, GLONASS and other satellite systems have modernized the means by which elevation differences are observed. In this article, we assessed the quality of GEIOD12B through long-occupation GNSS static surveys. A set of NGS benchmarks was occupied for at least one hour using dual-frequency GNSS receivers. Collected measurements were processed using a single CORS station at most 24 kilometers from the benchmarks. Geoid undulation values were driven by subtracting measured ellipsoidal heights from the orthometric heights posted on the NGS website. To assess the quality of GEOID12B, we compared our computed vertical shifts at the benchmarks with those estimated from GEOID12B published by NGS. In addition, Kriging model was used to interpolate local maps for the geoid undulations from the benchmark heights. The maps were compared with corresponding parts of GEOID12B. No biases were detected in the results and only shifts due to random errors were found. Discrepancies in the range of ten centimetres were noticed between our geoid undulation and the values available from NGS.

AB  - Groundwater is considered the major portion of the world's freshwater resources. One of the main challenges facing the sustainable development of Egypt is the need for better management of its limited fresh water resources. Groundwater exists in the Nile Valley, Nile Delta, Western Desert Oases, and Sinai Peninsula. Hydrogeological mapping of groundwater resources is one of the main tools for the controlled development of groundwater resources. Remotely sensed surface indicators of groundwater provide useful data where practical classical alternatives are not available. Integrated remote sensing and GIS are widely used in groundwater mapping. Locating potential groundwater targets is becoming more convenient, cost effective than invasive methods and efficient with the advent of a number of satellite imagery. The nature of remote sensing-based groundwater exploration is to delineate all possible features connected with localization of groundwater. Data, driven out of remote sensing, support decisions related to sustainable development and groundwater management.

AB  - Sustainable management and exploitation policies as well as suitable conservation and mitigation strategies are mandatory to preserve cultural heritage and to reduce threats, weathering phenomena, and human actions that may produce significant deterioration and alteration of cultural heritage and its environment. In this context, remote sensing technologies can offer useful data to timely update information and documentation and set up reliable tools for systematic monitoring of cultural properties. In this study, multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data from Corona, Landsat, Spot, Quickbird, and Sentinel-2A have been exploited along with spatial analysis to investigate the area of the Theban temples at west Luxor (Egypt), severely threatened by uncontrolled urban sprawl. The results from our analyses showed that the urban expansion continuously occurred during the whole investigated period causing an increasing in urban areas around (1) 1.316km(2) from 1967 to 1984, (2) 1.705km(2) from 1984 to 2000, (3) 0.978km(2) from 2000 to 2003, (4) 2.314km(2) from 2003 to 2011, and (5) 1.377km(2) from 2011 to 2017. The random urban expansion caused bad sewage networks and high groundwater depth which in turn affected the archaeological areas directly (as evident on a landscape view) and indirectly by causing changes (growing) in the level of ground water depth and increasing and accelerating weathering phenomena. The quantification and mapping of urban sprawl enabled us not only to quantify and spatially characterize urban sprawl but also to create a model to mitigate the impact and provide some operational recommendations to protect the archaeological site. Outcomes from our analysis pointed out that today the tremendous availability of advanced remote sensing data has opened new prospectives unthinkable several years ago.

AB  - Similar to other modelling methodologies, the potential of system dynamics to contribute to system understanding and decision making depends upon the practices applied by the modeller. However lessons about many of these practices are often unreported. This paper contributes to the methodology of system dynamics modelling of socio-ecological systems by 1) examining issues modellers face during the modelling process, and 2) providing guidance on how to effectively design and implement system dynamics modelling. This is achieved through an investigation of five case studies, drawing on lessons from these experiences. This is complemented by a literature review of system dynamics applied within the context of integrated modelling and environmental DSS. The case studies cover a variety of environmental issues and system dynamics modelling methods and tools. Although we used system dynamics as the common lens from which lessons are drawn, many of these insights transcend to other integrated modelling approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of fertilizers in agriculture in Egypt, especially nitrogen, has increased significantly in the last decade, resulting in nonpoint contamination of the groundwater resources. This study investigated the effect of using nitrogen fertilizer on groundwater contamination with nitrate in the central southern part of the Nile Delta. NO3- concentrations in shallow groundwater were assessed based on the applied urea dose (the common nitrogen fertilizer used) in year 2014. A groundwater modeling system (GMS) comprising MODFLOW and MT3D was used to simulate the threedimensional groundwater flow and NO3- transportation processes in El-Menoufia Governorate, located in the central region of the Nile Delta aquifer. Calibration for MODFLOW was conducted to match known head configurations to minimize the water balance differences. Calibration of MT3D was accomplished by fitting the model to the measured NO3- concentrations during the year 2014. The results highlighted areas of groundwater contamination by NO3-, which occurred at shallow depths (40 m) due to the significant loads of nitrogen fertilizer application and the flood irrigation method. While the results suggested one approach was to avoid using contaminated shallow groundwater as a water source, a more sustainable approach would be to implement best management practices to reduce and control the amount of nitrate leaching into the shallow groundwater system in the future.

AB  - Different scenarios of recharge and discharge were assessed for sustainable management of groundwater in Quaternary aquifer east of Nile Delta. MODFLOW was utilized to investigate the effect of land use change and damming construction in the upstream of the Nile River on the current and short-term groundwater management strategies. The interpretive transient simulation was performed between 2004 and 2016 after steady-state calibration in 2004, and transient state from 2004 to 2013 with different irrigation recharges associated with land use change in this period. Sensitivity analysis was performed for hydraulic conductivities, recharge, and conductance parameters. The predictive transient simulation was run till 2023 under three scenarios of increasing pumping rates by 15, 30, and 50% for agriculture expansion and specified head reduction of Port Said Canal by 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m associated with the reduction of Nile water levels after Grand Ethiopian Residence Dam, GERD operation in 2017. Results from the in- and out-flow budgets showed that groundwater aquifer is stable at the current rate of pumping till 2023. Groundwater heads decreased by 0.2 and 0.42 m in the southern section, and a slight increase in the northern part was noticed for the first and second scenarios, respectively. When additional pumping stress is applied (50% increase), groundwater head dropped by 0.66 m, and the storage is no longer able to maintain the aquifer capacity after 2020 (worst-case scenario).

AB  - Water resources have shaped the destinies of societies and affected settlement choice of civilizations for centuries. Demand for them is constantly increasing and this surge has become an important threat for water resources due to those excessive demands and variety of usage types; at the same time, balancing the protection and use of ground and surface waters has become more difficult. The progress in legal and corporate structures for water management has been too slow for a long time. In this study, principles of international conventions on groundwater are compared with the relevant Turkish groundwater legislation, which is in the process of harmonization with European Union (EU) acquis under the scope of Turkey's nomination for EU membership. The purpose of this study is to measure the compliance of Turkish legislation on groundwater with the relevant international principles and conventions, and also to analyze legal loopholes in Turkish legislation in accordance with the international principles and conventions to be determined.

AB  - The influence of submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) on the dynamics of coastal ecosystems is receiving increasing scientific attention, although our knowledge of this issue still remains insufficient. Understanding the ecological response of coastal ecosystems to SGD dynamics is important in order to evaluate and predict changes in coastal communities. The aim of the present study was to characterize the effect of groundwater discharge on subtidal soft-bottom macrofaunal assemblages in the south coast of Portugal (Algarve) at different times of the year and under different discharge regimes. Sediment macrofauna was sampled twice per season in spring and summer 2011 in two locations: one under influence of SGD (Olhos de Agua) and one not under that influence (Arrifes). The results showed that differences in community structure between locations occurred mainly during spring, when the magnitude of groundwater discharge was higher. Several individual taxa were strongly associated with the SGD, particularly during spring: the polychaete families Magelonidae and Oweniidae; the isopod Cyathura carinata; and the bivalves Tellimya ferruginosa and Tellina fabula. Some of these taxa are already considered indicators of SGD, whereas others merit further investigation. The average similarity among samples was consistently larger in the location with SGD and the average similarity between the two locations was generally higher during spring, indicating that SGD promote stability in macrobenthic communities across time and space. SGD were also associated with higher values of Chlorophyll a (Chl a), fine sediments and total abundance of organisms (particularly suspension feeders). This suggests that differences between locations are associated with SGD and mediated by nutrient fluxes and sediment transport, or their interaction.

AB  - Hydrogeological conceptual models are collections of hypotheses describing the understanding of groundwater systems and they are considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in groundwater flow and transport modelling. A common method for characterizing the conceptual uncertainty is the multi-model approach, where alternative plausible conceptual models are developed and evaluated. This review aims to give an overview of how multiple alternative models have been developed, tested and used for predictions in the multi-model approach in international literature and to identify the remaining challenges. The review shows that only a few guidelines for developing the multiple conceptual models exist, and these are rarely followed. The challenge of generating a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive range of plausible models is yet to be solved. Regarding conceptual model testing, the reviewed studies show that a challenge remains in finding data that is both suitable to discriminate between conceptual models and relevant to the model objective. We argue that there is a need for a systematic approach to conceptual model building where all aspects of conceptualization relevant to the study objective are covered. For each conceptual issue identified, alternative models representing hypotheses that are mutually exclusive should be defined. Using a systematic, hypothesis based approach increases the transparency in the modelling workflow and therefore the confidence in the final model predictions, while also anticipating conceptual surprises. While the focus of this review is on hydro geological applications, the concepts and challenges concerning model building and testing are applicable to spatio-temporal dynamical environmental systems models in general.

AB  - The water demand in arid regions is commonly covered by groundwater resources that date back to more humid periods of the Pleistocene and Holocene. Within the investigated arid part of SE Saudi-Arabia information about climate, groundwater levels, and pumping rates are only available for regions where groundwater extractions occur at present-day. For the prediction of the impact of long-term climate changes on groundwater resources an understanding of the hydrogeological and hydrological past and the development of the aquifers is necessary. Therefore, all available information about hydrology and hydrogeology for the past 10,000 years BP were collected and compiled to a conceptual model of the aquifer development on the Arabian Peninsula since the last Ice-Age. The climatic history was displayed by changes in precipitation, temperature and recharge during the mid-S and late Holocene. The hydrogeological development is described by groundwater ages, sea level fluctuations, movement of the coastline, and the development of sabkhas. The most sensitive parameter to describe the development of aquifer system is recharge. Present-day recharge was calculated with the hydrological model system HEC-HMS accounting for current precipitation, temperature, wind, soil types, and geomorphology. With respect to changes in precipitation and temperature over the past 10,000 years the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater recharge was calculated using empirical equations valid for semi-arid and arid settings. Further inflow into the groundwater system results from surface water infiltration in wadi beds, while natural outflow from the groundwater system occurs by discharge to the Gulf, evaporation from sabkhas, and spring discharge. Backward predictions can be verified by sedimentological observations of palaeo-river systems and lakes indicating that groundwater levels reached temporarily the surface under wetter climate conditions and C-14 groundwater ages displaying groundwater residence times.

AB  - A large-scale numerical flow and transport model was developed for the central-eastern arid part of the Arabian Peninsula. The model was applied to a region with freshwater resources dating back to more humid periods of the past, which are faced with overexploitation today. Model inflow was based on infiltration around wadi beds and groundwater recharge. Inflow was balanced by natural outflows, such as evaporation from sabkhas, spring discharge, and discharge to the sea. Two models were developed: (1) a short-term present-day model to estimate effective model parameters, and (2) a long-term model to study the development of the groundwater resources during the Mid- and Late Holocene and the natural response of the groundwater system to changes in climate. Hydraulic model parameters (hydraulic conductivity and specific storage) were assigned with respect to geological structures. Hydraulic parameters were estimated with an inverse PEST model by calibrating against observed depression cones cause by groundwater abstraction. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that estimated model parameters were associated with a high uncertainty at a certain distance from agricultural areas when calibration data were lacking. A long-term model starting 10,000 years BP was calibrated by spring discharge and palaeo-groundwater levels and validated using measured C-14 groundwater ages. The long-model predicted that groundwater levels adapted in response to changes in precipitation. During the Mid-Holocene, which was characterized by an intensification of the monsoon season, groundwater levels increased by 10 m on the mainland within the shallow aquifers and adapted quickly to higher recharge rates. The deeper aquifers were less affected by changes in climate. Along the present-day coastline, the groundwater level rose by about 25 m due to the declined sea level in the Mid-Holocene. During this period, surface run-off was possible as groundwater levels temporarily reached the ground surface. The natural groundwater budget reacted sensitively to changes in climate. Between 10 and 3 ka, groundwater storage occurred. During the Late Holocene, at 3 ka, natural depletion of the groundwater system began, which still prevails today.

AB  - The shallow subsurface in urban areas is increasingly used by shallow geothermal energy systems as a renewable energy resource and as a cheap cooling medium, e.g. for building air conditioning. In combination with further anthropogenic activities, this results in altered thermal regimes in the subsurface and the so-called subsurface urban heat island effect. Successful thermal management of urban groundwater resources requires understanding the relative contributions of the different thermal parameters and boundary conditions that result in the "present thermal state" of individual urban groundwater bodies. To evaluate the "present thermal state" of urban groundwater bodies, good quality data are required to characterize the hydraulic and thermal aquifer parameters. This process also involved adequate monitoring systems which provide consistent subsurface temperature measurements and are the basis for parameterizing numerical heat-transport models. This study is based on previous work already published for two urban groundwater bodies in Basel (CH) and Zaragoza (ES), where comprehensive monitoring networks (hydraulics and temperature) as well as calibrated high-resolution numerical flow- and heat-transport models have been analyzed. The "present thermal state" and how it developed according to the different hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions is compared to a "potential natural state" in order to assess the anthropogenic thermal changes that have already occurred in the urban groundwater bodies we investigated. This comparison allows us to describe the various processes concerning groundwater flow and thermal regimes for the different urban settings. Furthermore, the results facilitate defining goals for specific aquifer regions, including future aquifer use and urbanization, as well as evaluating the thermal use potential for these regions. As one example for a more sustainable thermal use of subsurface water resources, we introduce the thermal management concept of the "relaxation factor", which is a first approach to overcome the present policy of "first come, first served". Remediation measures to regenerate overheated urban aquifers are also introduced. The transferability of the applied methods to other urban areas is discussed. It is shown that an appropriate selection of locations for monitoring hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions make it possible to implement representative interpretations of groundwater flow and thermal regimes as well as to set up high-resolution numerical flow- and heat-transport models. Those models are the basis for the sustainable management of thermal resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents the development of tools for the sustainable thermal management of a shallow unconsolidated urban groundwater body in the city of Basel (Switzerland). The concept of the investigations is based on (1) a characterization of the present thermal state of the urban groundwater body, and (2) the evaluation of potential mitigation measures for the future thermal management of specific regions within the groundwater body. The investigations focus on thermal processes downgradient of thermal groundwater use, effects of heated buildings in the subsurface as well as the thermal influence of river-groundwater interaction. Investigation methods include (1) short-and long-term data analysis, (2) high-resolution multilevel groundwater temperature monitoring, as well as (3) 3-D numerical groundwater flow and heat transport modeling and scenario development. The combination of these methods allows for the quantifying of the thermal influences on the investigated urban groundwater body, including the influences of thermal groundwater use and heated subsurface constructions. Subsequently, first implications for management strategies are discussed, including minimizing further groundwater temperature increase, targeting "potential natural" groundwater temperatures for specific aquifer regions and exploiting the thermal potential.

AB  - In this study, a 3-D groundwater flow model was developed using MODFLOW-USG to investigate the groundwater levels within the Gaza coastal aquifer. Recharge estimation is based on a comprehensive approach including the connection to a surface water model (SWAT) for determining percolation from rainfall as well as detailed approaches regarding further recharge components. An unstructured grid (Voronoi cells) generated by MODFLOW-USG engine was used to reduce run time within complicated aquifer boundary conditions. The results indicate a very good fit between measured and simulated heads. Long-term forecasting (2004-2030) of the groundwater levels was carried out as an essential step to support realistic and sustainable water resources planning and decision making. The increasing built-up area was linked to the potential impacts of urban expansion relating to water supply quantities and groundwater recharge components. The percolation was reduced temporally and spatially in the forecasting period based on the projected built-up area as well as an urban-percolation index. Considering the current management situation, the annual groundwater level correlated negatively with the increasing built-up area; the regression line slope was -0.056 m/km(2) for the average groundwater levels while it became steeper at -0.23 m/km(2) in sensitive locations in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. The groundwater level trend index was developed as a spatial indicator for the appropriate management alternatives that can achieve less negative trend index.

AB  - Groundwater in many arid basins, particularly in developing countries, is the only available water resource that sustains local communities. Yet, information on the basic hydrological parameters and the sustainability of the groundwater exploitation are often lacking. This study investigates the origin of groundwater from the Lower Cambrian carbonate aquifer of the Lakhssas Plateau in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of southwestern Morocco. The study aims to reveal the origin of the groundwater, salinity sources, and the residence time of the water. The study is based on a comprehensive geochemical and isotopic (oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and strontium) investigation of groundwater from different parts of the basin. The hydrochemical and isotopes results indicated three types of groundwater in the Lakhssas Plateau: (1) thermal water in the southern part of the basin with solute composition that reflects dissolution of calcium-sulfate and calcium carbonate minerals; (2) low-temperature groundwater at the southern margin of the basin with low salinity (chloride content up to 100 mg/L) and chemical composition that is expected from equilibrium with limestone-dolomite rocks; and (3) low-temperature groundwater in the northern, western, and eastern margins of the basin with a wide range of salinity (chloride up to 800 mg/L). The different water types had also different stable isotope composition; the thermal water was depleted in O-18 and H-2 (delta O-18 as low as -7.6 parts per thousand) relative to the southern (-5.9 to -5.3 parts per thousand) and northern waters (-5.7 to -3.8 parts per thousand). The differences in delta O-18 and delta H-2 between the southern and northern waters are related to elevation that induced fractionation of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in recharge water originated from coastal moisture. The data suggest that the high salinity in groundwater from the northern, western and eastern margins of the Lakhssas Plateau is related to the presence of schist rocks in these areas. The distinctive low Na/Cl arid Br/Cl ratios, coupled with high silica contents and high Sr-87/Sr-88 ratios (up to 0.713) in the saline groundwater provide additional evidences for the link between salinity and the schist rocks. In contrast, the thermal water had relatively low Sr-87/Sr-88 ratio (0.7089), which is identical to the secular seawater Sr isotope ratio during the Early Cambrian period and presumably reflects interaction with the Early Cambrian carbonate and sulfate aquifer rocks. In the northern and southern groundwater, the Sr-87/Sr-88 ratios were higher and correlated with the Mg/Ca ratios, inferring mixing between the Early Cambrian limestone and other rocks with higher Sr-87/Sr-88, such as the schist rocks. The radiocarbon data showed C-14 activities ranging from 6 pmC in the thermal water to 62 pmC in the southern water. Age-modeling, corrected for dissolution of the carbonate rocks with dead carbon, simulated mean residence time of 10-15 ka BP for the thermal water and a range of 0 to 3 ka BP for the northern and southern waters, depending on the used models. The integration of the data enables us to establish a conceptual model for the origin of groundwater in the Lakhssas Plateau: (1) recharge to the aquifer from relatively heavy-isotope depleted recharge water, presumably during wetter conditions about 10-15 ka BP. The recharge water interacted at high depth with limestone and calcium sulfate minerals and emerged to the surface as thermal water at the southern part of the basin; (2) more recent recharge from coastal moisture originated from the Atlantic Ocean. The stable-isotope composition of groundwater was controlled by the elevation of their recharge areas: recharge at higher elevation, particularly in the southern margin resulted in lower delta O-18 and delta H-2 values; (3) the recharge water interacted with the carbonate aquifer rocks, particularly with calcite and dolomite minerals. In areas of exposure of schist rocks, the water-rock interaction induced salinization of the groundwater. Overall, our data reveal that the limited water resources in this semi-arid zone of Morocco could be in some parts less renewable and also saline. Future exploitation of this basin will have to account the salinity factor and the suggested contribution of water recharged some thousands years ago. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deficit irrigation (DI) is an agricultural practice in which the volume of irrigation water applied during the crop cycle is below the irrigation requirements for maximum production, the aim of which is to increase irrigation water productivity. Most research on this technique has focused on agronomic strategies while the economic and environmental consequences have received little attention. This study aims to shed some light on this matter and presents preliminary results regarding the implications of DI with respect to the sustainable use of water resources. The analysis is based on the DPSIR analytical framework (Driving force/Pressure/State/Impact/Response) and the microeconomics of DI. The case study focuses on intensive olive groves in the Guadalquivir river basin in Southern Spain (where olive cultivation accounts for 50% of the total irrigated area). The analysis shows that the widespread use of DI practices, which is the farmers' response to a decreasing net water supply and falling farm incomes (driving force) in the context of a mature water economy, may help to break the DPSIR chain of causality, provided that there are restrictions on any expansion in irrigated area. They can, thus, play a role in achieving sustainable water use. Conversely, demand and supply (regulator) responses involving raising the price of water would lead to higher pressures on the resource and represent a negative driving force in our DPSIR model.

AB  - The world is increasingly urban but there are few studies of how contaminated water and sediment move through urban basins with their built landscapes and complexly disturbed geology. The central Canadian city of Pickering, Ontario sprawls across a small (27 km(2)) densely urbanized (pop: 53,000) watershed and is underlain by Pleistocene glacial sediments and thick artificial fill deposits. Almost 80% of the area is hardened by impervious cover; road and rail lines cover 40% and include Canada's busiest highway (12-lane Highway 401: 177,000 vehicles per day in 2003). The basin discharges to Lake Ontario through a small (85 ha) shallow (<3.5 m) lagoon (Frenchman's Bay). A 3-D steady state finite element groundwater numerical model (FEFLOW) was applied to 200 cored and geophysically-logged (gamma and resistivity) boreholes and 3400 digital water wells. It identifies the subsurface stratigraphy and hydrostratigraphic function of deposits and the rates of groundwater flow. Year-round monitoring Of groundwater, creek and lagoon water quality shows that transportation infrastructure is the primary source of contaminated water and sediment. Some 7600 tonnes of de-icing salt are applied to watershed roads each year: 52% accumulates in groundwater where it continues to be released as brackish baseflow to creeks in summer. The remainder is rapidly delivered by surface runoff to Frenchman's Bay where chloride contents are more than double the average values in waters across the Great Lakes. Highway 401 is the largest single Source of salt contamination to the lagoon: it receives 26% of all road salt applied to the watershed but covers just 1.3% of its area. Prominent spikes in chloride content (>2000 mg L(-1)) occur during winter thaws in creeks downstream of the highway. Enhanced stream bank erosion as a consequence of flashy storm runoff from road surfaces moves similar to 100 tonnes of contaminated sediment to Frenchman's Bay each year. Instantaneous suspended sediment concentrations in storm runoff are as high as 1600 g m(-3) and loadings of sulphate (SO(4)(-2)) nutrients reach 594 kg h(-1). Metals and E coli in road runoff are all elevated well above Canadian water quality standards. These findings underscore findings from other urban areas regardless of regional climate, that transportation corridors are a major global Source of contaminated water and sediment.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the quasi-elastic deformational behavior that has been induced by groundwater withdrawal of the Tertiary detrital aquifer of Madrid (Spain). The spatial and temporal evolution of ground surface displacement was estimated by processing two datasets of radar satellite images (SAR) using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI). The first SAR dataset was acquired between April 1992 and November 2000 by ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites, and the second one by the ENVISAT satellite between August 2002 and September 2010. The spatial distribution of PSI measurements reveals that the magnitude of the displacement increases gradually towards the center of the well field area, where approximately 80 mm of maximum cumulated displacement is registered. The correlation analysis made between displacement and piezometric time series provides a correlation coefficient greater than 85% for all the wells. The elastic and inelastic components of measured displacements were separated, observing that the elastic component is, on average, more than 4 times the inelastic component for the studied period. Moreover, the hysteresis loops on the stress-strain plots indicate that the response is in the elastic range. These results demonstrate the quasi-elastic behavior of the aquifer. During the aquifer recovery phase ground surface uplift almost recovers from the subsidence experienced during the preceding extraction phase. Taking into account this unique aquifer system, a one dimensional elastic model was calibrated in the period 1997-2000. Subsequently, the model was used to predict the ground surface movements during the period 1992-2010. Modeled displacements were validated with PSI displacement measurements, exhibiting an error of 13% on average, related with the inelastic component of deformation occurring as a long-term trend in low permeability fine-grained units. This result further demonstrates the quasi-elastic deformational behavior of this unique aquifer system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Venetian plain is a densely populated area and one of the most economically competitive regions in Europe. Therefore, a sustainable management of the water resources has to be accomplished to preserve both the social and economic value of this area and the regional environment in accordance with the European water policy directives. This paper presents the analysis of hydrologic and hydrogeological water balances of the high alluvial plain (approximately 790 km(2)) highlighting some important peculiarities that could be crucial for the local water policy. By focusing on the importance of different water budget components, the obtained results indicate in the irrigation the most relevant component of the aquifer recharge. Thus, the irrigation management policy of the Land Reclamation Consortia strongly influences aquifer recharge. Moreover, future scenarios (2071-2100) for the high Venetian plain are performed taking into account the changes of climate and irrigation policy. The inflow of the aquifer suffers a decrease ranging from 18% in the scenario influenced by climate change to 28% in the scenario affected by both the variations. In particular, the irrigation recharge shows the highest reduction due to both an increase in evaporation, owing to an increase in the surface temperature, or the irrigation methods. Therefore, the irrigation management policy adopted by the Land Reclamation Consortia is a fundamental concern. Changes from surface irrigation to spray or drip irrigation could strongly affect the aquifer recharge. The classical technique of surface irrigation is very useful in terms of aquifer recharge in comparison with drip or spray irrigation. However, it also requires a huge volume of water compared with the minimum desirable streamflow of a river and its management policy. Currently in Italy, the transition from conventional irrigation systems to water saving techniques is favored by the Land Reclamation Consortia in response to European and Italian directives. However, the possible reduction of the aquifer recharge could influence the actual social and economic condition of the Venetian plain because the human and industrial water needs are mostly dependent by groundwater exploitation. Therefore, water saving activities should be accompanied by appropriate corrective actions to reduce the environmental and social impact due to the decrease in aquifer recharge.

AB  - Although we have an intuitive understanding of the behavior and functions of groundwater in the Earth's critical zone at the scales of a column (atmosphere-plant-soil-bedrock), along a toposequence (ridge to valley), and across a small catchment (up to third-order streams), this paper attempts to assess the relevance of groundwater to understanding large-scale patterns and processes such as represented in global climate and Earth system models. Through observation syntheses and conceptual models, evidence are presented that groundwater influence is globally prevalent, it forms an environmental gradient not fully captured by the climate, and it can profoundly shape critical zone evolution at continental to global scales. Four examples are used to illustrate these ideas: (1) groundwater as a water source for plants in rainless periods, (2) water table depth as a driver of plant rooting depth, (3) the accessibility of groundwater as an ecological niche separator, and (4) groundwater as the lower boundary of land drainage and a global driver of wetlands. The implications to understanding past and future global environmental change are briefly discussed, as well as critical discipline, scale, and data gaps that must be bridged in order for us to translate what we learn in the field at column, hillslope and catchment scales, to what we must predict at regional, continental, and global scales.

AB  - Wetlands are ecosystems of important functions in the earth's climate system. Through relatively high evapotranspiration, they affect surface water and energy exchange with the atmosphere directly influencing the physical climate. Through CH4, CO2 and N2O fluxes, they regulate the biogeochemical cycles, indirectly influencing the physical climate. However, current models do not explicitly include the water table, present under all large and stable wetlands; model wetlands are identified as flat land with wet soil resulting from precipitation events. That is, the wetlands are only 'wetted' from above but not from below by the high water table. Furthermore, without the knowledge of the water table position, estimates of CH4 and other gases (e.g., CO2 and N2O) are poorly constrained. We present a simple hydrologic framework for simulating wetlands based on water table depth. A synthesis of hydrologic controls on wetlands highlights the key role that groundwater plays. It directly feeds wetlands, supports surface-water fed wetlands by maintaining a saturated substrate, and links land drainage to sea level by impeding drainage in lowlands. Forced by routine climate model output (precipitation-evapotranspiration-surface runoff), land topography, and sea level, we simulate the present-day water table in North America at the 1 km scale. We validate the simulation with water table observations and compare regions of shallow water table to mapped wetlands. Our results show that the framework captures the salient features of wetland distribution and extent at regional and continental scales, a direct result of large-scale groundwater convergence that nourishes the lowlands even in arid climates. The low requirement of forcing and computation make the framework easy to adopt in climate and earth system models for simulating wetland responses to climate and sea level change for the present, paleo reconstructions, and future projections.

AB  - Fluid circulation in the Earth's crust plays an essential role in surface, near surface, and deep crustal processes. Flow pathways are driven by hydraulic gradients but controlled by material permeability, which varies over many orders of magnitude and changes over time. Although millions of measurements of crustal properties have been made, including geophysical imaging and borehole tests, this vast amount of data and information has not been integrated into a comprehensive knowledge system. A community data infrastructure is needed to improve data access, enable large-scale synthetic analyses, and support representations of the subsurface in Earth system models. Here, we describe the motivation, vision, challenges, and an action plan for a community-governed, four-dimensional data system of the Earth's crustal structure, composition, and material properties from the surface down to the brittle-ductile transition. Such a system must not only be sufficiently flexible to support inquiries in many different domains of Earth science, but it must also be focused on characterizing the physical crustal properties of permeability and porosity, which have not yet been synthesized at a large scale. The DigitalCrust is envisioned as an interactive virtual exploration laboratory where models can be calibrated with empirical data and alternative hypotheses can be tested at a range of spatial scales. It must also support a community process for compiling and harmonizing models into regional syntheses of crustal properties. Sustained peer review from multiple disciplines will allow constant refinement in the ability of the system to inform science questions and societal challenges and to function as a dynamic library of our knowledge of Earth's crust.

AB  - In the earth and environmental sciences, many fundamental processes are explained through conceptual illustrationsa powerful medium for scientific communication. The processes depicted are generally highly complex, spatially and temporally variable, subject to high degrees of uncertainty, and non-linearly impacted by anthropogenic actions. Conceptual illustrations necessarily simplify these processes, but also often suffer from a preventable lack of visual clarity, and/or are based on implicit assumptions that are mismatched to key conclusions in published literature. In this Innovative Viewpoint paper, we highlight considerations of conceptual and visual clarity relevant to illustrations in earth and environmental sciences. Using the water cycle as an example, we examine a range of conceptual illustrations of this process to assess what ideas they convey. An exploratory survey of 32 water cycle diagrams shows that they tend to depict generalized, well-defined processes. Anthropogenic influences are included and/or implied in only half the diagrams, and none depict uncertainty in any form. The concept of the water cycle conveyed by these diagrams is therefore not quite the same as the concept of the water cycle as understood by hydrologists. This mismatch may negatively impact decision-making related to water resources management, because the parties involved may unknowingly hold significantly different conceptual models of the processes at work. Other concepts in the earth and environmental sciences may be susceptible to similar issues. Our analysis highlights the importance of carefully assessing the assumptions and simplifying choices inherent in the process of translating a concept into an illustration. We conclude with an example of how these issues can be remedied by presenting a modified water cycle diagram designed to address common misconceptions associated with dryland systems, account for uncertainty in fluxes, and include key anthropogenic effects. A general list of best practices, many of which were used to develop this diagram, is included to help increase awareness among environmental researchers of strategies for increasing the conceptual and visual clarity of illustrations.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been increasingly used in the field of wastewater treatment where the focus has been to identify environmental trade-offs of current technologies. in a novel approach, we use LCA to support early stage research and development of a biochemical system for wastewater resource recovery. The freshwater and nutrient content of wastewater are recognized as potential valuable resources that can be recovered for beneficial reuse. Both recovery and reuse are intended to address existing environmental concerns, for example, water scarcity and use of non-renewable phosphorus. However, the resource recovery may come at the cost of unintended environmental impacts. One promising recovery system, referred to as TRENS, consists of an enhanced biological phosphorus removal and recovery system (EBP2R) connected to a photobioreactor. Based on a simulation of a full-scale nutrient and water recovery system in its potential operating environment, we assess the potential environmental impacts of such a system using the EASETECH model. In the simulation, recovered water and nutrients are used in scenarios of agricultural irrigation-fertilization and aquifer recharge. In these scenarios, TRENS reduces global warming up to 15% and marine eutrophication impacts up to 9% compared to conventional treatment. This is due to the recovery and reuse of nutrient resources, primarily nitrogen. The key environmental concerns obtained through the LCA are linked to increased human toxicity impacts from the chosen end use of wastewater recovery products. The toxicity impacts are from both heavy metals release associated with land application of recovered nutrients and production of AlCl3, which is required for advanced wastewater treatment prior to aquifer recharge. Perturbation analysis of the LCA pinpointed nutrient substitution and heavy metals content of algae biofertilizer as critical areas for further research if the performance of nutrient recovery systems such as TRENS is to be better characterized. Our study provides valuable feedback to the TRENS developers and identifies the importance of system expansion to include impacts outside the immediate nutrient recovery system itself. The study also show for the first time the successful evaluation of urban-to-agricultural water systems in EASETECH. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Approaches to improve the governance of social-ecological systems are difficult to define in situations where governance is weak, that is, involving limited interactions between the actors and weak management of natural resources. This article analyzes an action research process implemented in the Chaouia coastal region of Morocco, where weak governance of the social-ecological system led to a groundwater and agricultural crisis. A dialogue between local actors was set up with the aim of identifying strategies to address the crisis. First separately and then together, farmers' groups and staff members of public organizations analyzed the existing situation, scenarios for the future of the area, and strategies to cope with the crisis. Contrary to the expectations of the participants, farmers and staff members of public organizations had productive discussions. This approach clarified how social learning can be achieved and governance improved in this situation of weak governance.

AB  - In the last 50 years, the study of groundwater governance has given rise to rich and differentiated analytical approaches. This article proposes an exchange between the main heuristic viewpoints, results and theses of three approaches which studied groundwater governance: the study of groundwater governance as collective action initiated by Ostrom, the analysis made by Shah on informal groundwater economies and the works of Prakash, Mukherji and Birkenholtz drawing on political ecology. The aquifers on which each approach originally built its analysis played a key role in the design of analytical frameworks which, in the case of the first two approaches, were later applied to a much larger set of cases. The three approaches share many commonalities in their heuristic methods. However, they differ in the content of governance systems recommended to achieve sustainable groundwater use, and especially in the benefits of involving water users in the implementation of governance. Therefore, they also differ on what should be the focus of academic analyses. It is thus of interest to organize joint readings of cases of groundwater governance and to discuss the contents of research programmes able to provide fruitful analyses of these cases, based on local specificities.

AB  - Antecedent physical factors are used in calculations, which endowed set pair analysis with predictive abilities. Set pair analysis can make predictions based on calculations using antecedent physical factors. In this study, the fitted value based on set pair analysis agreed with the actual value of the average annual discharge grade at Yamadu Station, which showed that the prediction was valid. It's predicted that the average annual discharge at Yamadu Station in 1975 was a dry year, i.e. y < 385 m(3)/s, while the actual average annual discharge at Yamadu Station in 1975 was 301 m(3)/s, which confirmed the prediction that it was a dry year. Three physical factors were not processed using set pair analysis so they could be compared with the calculated results. These factors were used directly to establish a regression equation for the average annual discharge grade and obtained a fitted value of for the average annual discharge grade at Yamadu Station during 1953-1974. It's known that the prediction of the average annual discharge grade for 1966 using a regression equation derived from the data differed from the actual situation, thereby indicating that set pair analysis can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions.

AB  - This paper presents a study of the potential for green infrastructure (GI) to restore the predevelopment hydrologic cycle in a semi-arid urban catchment. Simulations of stormwater runoff from a 0.11-km(2) urban catchment in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA for predeveloped (Natural Hydrology, NH), developed (Baseline, BL), and developed with GI (Green Infrastructure, GI) conditions were executed for a one-year period. The study was repeated for a relatively dry year, wet year, and an average year based on precipitation amounts in the year. Bioretention and green roofs were chosen for the GI plan. Results showed that the water budget of the catchment with the GI plan implemented more closely matches the NH water budget compared to the BL scenario, for all three years (dry, wet, average). The BL and GI scenarios showed more significant modifications to the water budget than what has been found by studies in humid climates. Compared to the BL condition, GI annually reduces surface runoff by 35%, 45%, and 43% and restores evapotranspiration by 18%, 19%, and 25% for the dry, average, wet years, respectively. Based on the introduced water budget restoration coefficient (WBRC), the water budget of the study catchment was restored by the GI plan to 90%, 90%, and 82% of the predevelopment state in the dry, average, and wet years, respectively. By comparing the WBRC estimated for other studies, it is further inferred that the water budget is more significantly affected by development and GI restoration in semi-arid than humid climates, but the differences lessen as the precipitation amount increases.

AB  - Southwestern US irrigated landscapes are facing upheaval due to water scarcity and land use conversion associated with climate change, population growth, and changing economics. In the traditionally irrigated valleys of northern New Mexico, these stresses, as well as instances of community longevity in the face of these stresses, are apparent. Human systems have interacted with hydrologic processes over the last 400 years in river-fed irrigated valleys to create linked systems. In this study, we ask if concurrent data from multiple disciplines could show that human-adapted hydrologic and socioeconomic systems have created conditions for resilience. Various types of resiliencies are evident in the communities. Traditional local knowledge about the hydrosocial cycle of community water management and ability to adopt new water management practices is a key response to disturbances such as low water supply from drought. Livestock producers have retained their irrigated land by adapting: changing from sheep to cattle and securing income from outside their livestock operations. Labor-intensive crops decreased as off-farm employment opportunities became available. Hydrologic resilience of the system can be affected by both human and natural elements. We find, for example, that there are multiple hydrologic benefits of traditional irrigation system water seepage: it recharges the groundwater that recharges rivers, supports threatened biodiversity by maintaining riparian vegetation, and ameliorates impacts of climate change by prolonging streamflow hydrographs. Human decisions to transfer water out of agriculture or change irrigation management, as well as natural changes such as long-term drought or climate change, can result in reduced seepage and the benefits it provides. We have worked with the communities to translate the multidisciplinary dimensions of these systems into a common language of causal loop diagrams, which form the basis for modeling future scenarios to identify thresholds and tipping points of sustainability. Early indications are that these systems, though not immune to upheaval, have astonishing resilience.

AB  - This paper proposes and analyzes three policy instruments which can be used to enhance farmers' compliance with individual water allocations in a decentralized management context. Three regulation strategies are proposed for the case of groundwater allocations for irrigation: the first relies on economic instruments; the second is based on tools designed to promote pro-social behaviors; and the third combines assumptions from the first two approaches. They are evaluated through 16 scenario workshops involving 124 stakeholders and farmers in five French groundwater basins. Stakeholders' perceptions are analyzed, disentangling the ethical, economic, institutional, social and technical perspectives underlying the stakeholders' arguments for or against the proposed instruments for groundwater-use regulation. The analysis reveals a preference for the strategy that combines economic and social incentives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater is one of the most important environmental resources and its use continuously rises globally for industrial, agricultural, and drinking water supply purposes. Because of its importance, more knowledge about the volume of usable groundwater is necessary to satisfy the global demand. Due to the challenges in quantifying the volume of available global groundwater, studies which aim to assess its magnitude are limited in number. They are further restricted in scope and depth of analysis as, in most cases, they do not explain how the estimates of global groundwater resources have been obtained, what methods have been used to generate the figures and what levels of uncertainty exist. This article reviews the estimates of global groundwater resources. It finds that the level of uncertainty attached to existing numbers often exceeds 100 % and strives to establish the reasons for discrepancy. The outcome of this study outlines the need for a new agenda in water research with a more pronounced focus on groundwater. This new research agenda should aim at enhancing the quality and quantity of data provision on local and regional groundwater stocks and flows. This knowledge enhancement can serve as a basis to improve policy-making on groundwater resources globally. Research-informed policies will facilitate more effective groundwater management practices to ensure a more rapid progress of the global water sector towards the goal of sustainability.

AB  - We introduce a groundwater sustainability index offering a novel combination of features. It is holistic in the sense that it incorporates both water quantity and water quality indicators. The former employs the signal-to-noise ratio of long-term trends estimated via robust regression; the latter uses concentration of the primary contaminant of concern. A fuzzy inference system integrates these unlike metrics. The system also explicitly encodes expert knowledge and stakeholder values, and directly acknowledges subjectivity in environmental condition "grading," through the use of linguistic rules and fuzzy sets, respectively. The fuzzy rule base is constructed such that poor environmental conditions captured by one measure are not hidden by good performance in another. A standard Mamdani (max-min) inference engine is used with centroid defuzzification. The outcome is an intuitively accessible index ranging from 0 to 100. The method is demonstrated using examples from the Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer, an important and managerially challenging transboundary (Canada-US) water resource.

AB  - Coupled hydrological-hydrogeological models, emphasising the importance of the stream-aquifer interface, are more and more used in hydrological sciences for pluri-disciplinary studies aiming at investigating environmental issues. Based on an extensive literature review, stream-aquifer interfaces are described at five different scales: local [10 cm-similar to 10 m], intermediate [similar to 10 m-similar to 1 km], watershed [10 km(2)-similar to 1000 km(2)], regional [10 000 km(2)-similar to 1 M km(2)] and continental scales [> 10 M km(2)]. This led us to develop the concept of nested stream-aquifer interfaces, which extends the well-known vision of nested groundwater pathways towards the surface, where the mixing of low frequency processes and high frequency processes coupled with the complexity of geomorphological features and heterogeneities creates hydrological spiralling. This conceptual framework allows the identification of a hierarchical order of the multi-scale control factors of stream-aquifer hydrological exchanges, from the larger scale to the finer scale. The hyporheic corridor, which couples the river to its 3-D hyporheic zone, is then identified as the key component for scaling hydrological processes occurring at the interface. The identification of the hyporheic corridor as the support of the hydrological processes scaling is an important step for the development of regional studies, which is one of the main concerns for water practitioners and resources managers. In a second part, the modelling of the stream-aquifer interface at various scales is investigated with the help of the conductance model. Although the usage of the temperature as a tracer of the flow is a robust method for the assessment of stream-aquifer exchanges at the local scale, there is a crucial need to develop innovative methodologies for assessing stream-aquifer exchanges at the regional scale. After formulating the conductance model at the regional and intermediate scales, we address this challenging issue with the development of an iterative modelling methodology, which ensures the consistency of stream-aquifer exchanges between the intermediate and regional scales. Finally, practical recommendations are provided for the study of the interface using the innovative methodology MIM (Measurements-Interpolation-Modelling), which is graphically developed, scaling in space the three pools of methods needed to fully understand stream-aquifer interfaces at various scales. In the MIM space, stream-aquifer interfaces that can be studied by a given approach are localised. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated with two examples. The first one proposes an upscaling framework, structured around river reaches of similar to 10-100 m, from the local to the watershed scale. The second example highlights the usefulness of space borne data to improve the assessment of stream-aquifer exchanges at the regional and continental scales. We conclude that further developments in modelling and field measurements have to be undertaken at the regional scale to enable a proper modelling of stream-aquifer exchanges from the local to the continental scale.

AB  - Groundwater pumping, even if only seasonal, may significantly impact groundwater-dependent ecosystems through increased streamflow depletion, particularly in semiarid and arid regions. The effects are exacerbated, under some conditions, by climate change. In social sciences, the management of groundwater-dependent ecosystems is generally considered a wicked problem due to the complexity of affected stakeholder groups, disconnected legal frameworks, and a divergence of policies and science at the cross road between groundwater and surface water, and between ecosystems and water quality. A range of often simplified scientific tools plays an important role in addressing such problems. Here we develop a spatiotemporally distributed soil water budget model that we couple with an analytical model for stream depletion from groundwater pumping to rapidly assess seasonal impacts of groundwater pumping on streamflow during critical low flow periods. We demonstrate the applicability of the tool for the Scott Valley in Northern California, where protected salmon depend on summer streamflow fed by cool groundwater. In this example, simulations suggest that increased recharge in the period immediately preceding the critical low streamflow season, and transfer of groundwater pumping away from the stream are potentially promising tools to address ecosystem concerns, albeit raising difficult infrastructure and water trading issues. In contrast, additional winter recharge at the expense of later spring recharge, whether intentional or driven by climate may reduce summer streamflows. Comparison to existing detailed numerical groundwater model results suggests that the coupled soil water mass balancestream depletion function approach provides a viable tool for scenario development among stakeholders, to constructively inform the search for potential solutions, and to direct more detailed, complex site-specific feasibility studies. The tool also identifies important field monitoring efforts needed to improve the understanding and quantification of site-specific groundwater-stream interactions.

In this paper, the hydrogeology of a range-and-basin hydrogeological system is described, based on potentiometric, hydrochemical and isotopic data, in order to fulfill a twofold objective: to characterize the alteration brought about in the hydrogeological system by intensive groundwater withdrawal, where tectonic elements such as fault zones play a significant role in the flow behaviour, and to define groundwater hydrodynamics under current human pressures as a necessary step to achieve appropriate groundwater management. Hydraulic head data indicate the relationships between geological formations in the range areas and the sedimentary infill of the basin. In this set-up, fault zones and a fracture network have a direct effect on the recharge, and allow upward vertical flow from the basement to the sedimentary aquifers. Hydrochemical and isotopic data support this observation. The use of fluoride and nitrate as tracers for the contribution of deep and shallow flow systems provides a detailed portrait of the effects of pumping on the flow path distribution. Isotopic data depict seasonal trends in the water captured by wells. In this connection, we can differentiate between two distinct flow systems: a regional, large-scale, longer residence time system, originating in the surrounding ranges, and a local flow system constituted by infiltration in the lower areas of the basin. The two systems, with specific water qualities, contribute differently to the resources that are withdrawn, and their specific contributions, in the frame of the basin water budget, determine the potential for present sustainable water exploitation.

AB  - Freshwater submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) frequently occurs in areas of karst coastline where karst aquifers are hydraulically connected to the sea. Though up to 25% of the world's coastline is karst, little work has been done to determine the ecological impacts of karst-channelled freshwater SGD. Reported herein are the effects of karst-channelled freshwater SGD on the rock pool sessile assemblage in the locale of Olhos de Agua on the south Portuguese coast. Two quadrat surveys were conducted in eight intertidal rock pools, which ranged in freshwater SGD content from 0 to 57.3%. Salinity and nitrogen (NO3- and NO2-) concentrations were measured in the eight surveyed rock pools, as well as a further three rock pools on the same plateau, three inland groundwater boreholes and the adjacent coastal marine environment. There was a strong negative correlation between salinity (used as a proxy for freshwater SGD) and nitrogen concentration (r(2) = 0.98; p < 0.01), with rock pool nitrogen concentrations ranging from 15.3 mu M at salinity 36 (0% freshwater SGD) to similar to 515 mu M at salinity 4.27 (88% freshwater SGD). The concentration of nitrogen in the inland boreholes was elevated (similar to 258- similar to 450 mu M), though lower than that of the rock pool with the highest freshwater SGD content. Freshwater SGD was associated with altered percentage cover of sessile organisms (p = 0.03), decreased organism cover (n.s.), and decreased species number (n.s). There was a negative correlation between freshwater SGD and the percentage cover of the coralline red algae Ellisolandia elongata (r(2) = 0.811; t = 4.88; df = 8; p < 0.01). The most abundant algae, Ulva spp., was found in all rock pools except the rock pool with the highest fraction of SGD. These results provide evidence for a direct influence of karst-channelled freshwater SGD over the composition of the rock pool sessile assemblage. These results suggest a greater role of salinity than nitrogen additions in conditioning the form of the rock pool sessile assemblage.

AB  - Watersheds located within a mountain to coast physiographic setting have been described as having a highly interconnected surface water and groundwater environment. The quantification of groundwater-surface water interactions at the watershed scale requires upscaling. This study uses MIKE SHE, a coupled numerical model, to explore the seasonally and spatially dynamic nature of these interactions in the Cowichan Watershed on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The calibrated model simulates a transition of the Cowichan River from mostly gaining within the valley, to losing stream near the coast where groundwater extraction is focused. Losing and gaining sections correlate with geological substrate. Recharge across the watershed accounts for 17% of precipitation. Climate change is projected to lessen snowpack accumulation in the high alpine and alter timing of snowmelt, resulting in higher spring and winter river discharge and lower summer flows.

AB  - Farmers in regions experiencing water stress or drought conditions can struggle to balance their crop portfolios. Periods of low precipitation often lead to increased, unsustainable reliance on groundwater-supplied irrigation. As a result, regional water management agencies place limits on the amount of water which can be obtained from groundwater, requiring farmers to reduce acreage for more water-intensive crops or remove them from the portfolio entirely. Real-time decisions must be made by the farmer to ensure viability of their farming operation and reduce the impacts associated with limited water resources. Evolutionary algorithms, coupled with accurate, flexible, realistic simulation tools, are ideal mechanisms to allow farmers to assess scenarios with regard to multiple, competing objectives. In order to effective, however, one must be able to select among a variety of simulation tools and optimization algorithms. Many simulation tools allow no access to the source code, and many optimization algorithms are now packaged as part of a suite of tools available to a user. In this work, we describe a framework for integrating these different software components using only their associated input and output streams. We analyze our strategy by coupling a multi-objective genetic algorithm available in the DAKOTA optimization suite (developed and distributed by Sandia National Laboratory) with the MODFLOW-FMP2 simulation tool (developed and distributed by the United States Geological Survey). MODFLOW-FMP2 has been used extensively to model hydrological and farming processes in agriculture-dciminated regions, allowing us to represent both farming and conservation interests. We evaluate our integration by considering a case study related to planting decisions facing farmers experiencing water stress. We present numerical results for three competing objectives associated with stakeholders in a given region (i.e., profitability, meeting demand targets, and water conservation). The data obtained from the optimization are robust with respect to algorithmic parameter choices, validating the ability of the associated evolutionary algorithm to perform well without expert guidance. This is integral to our approach, as a motivation for this work is providing decision-making tools. In addition, the results from this study demonstrate that output from the chosen evolutionary algorithm provides a suite of feasible planting scenarios, giving farmers and policy makers the ability to compromise solutions based on realistic simulation data.

AB  - The development of appropriate water management strategies requires, in part, a methodology for quantifying and evaluating the impact of water policy decisions on regional stakeholders. In this work, we describe the framework we are developing to enhance the body of resources available to policy makers, farmers, and other community members in their efforts to understand, quantify, and assess the often competing objectives water consumers have with respect to usage. The foundation for the framework is the construction of a simulation-based optimization software tool using two existing software packages. In particular, we couple a robust optimization software suite (DAKOTA) with the USGS MF-OWHM water management simulation tool to provide a flexible software environment that will enable the evaluation of one or multiple (possibly competing) user-defined (or stakeholder) objectives. We introduce the individual software components and outline the communication strategy we defined for the coupled development. We present numerical results for case studies related to crop portfolio management with several defined objectives. The objectives are not optimally satisfied for any single user class, demonstrating the capability of the software tool to aid in the evaluation of a variety of competing interests.

AB  - Geoelectrical and electromagnetic (time and frequency domains) hydrogeophysical methods were applied and jointly interpreted together with auxiliary information such as regional piezometric maps, borehole lithological logs and offshore data. The objective was to retrieve the structure and geometry of the Albufeira-Ribeira de Quarteira coastal aquifer system (Algarve, Portugal) and to upgrade the current hydrogeological conceptual model. The results allowed for the detection of the freshwater-saltwater interface along the coastline and identification of the water-bearing layers and aquitards and their hydraulic relationships. An explanation for the location of the inter- and subtidal fresh groundwater discharge is also presented and a new modeling unit is proposed for groundwater flow modeling. Limitations of the used hydrogeophysical methods are indicated and recommendations are made for follow-up studies.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to identify which of the world's cereal producing regions are likely to become vulnerable to climate change over the 21st century by identifying those regions that will be (1) exposed to climatic stress and (2) have a limited capacity to adapt. First, we use a global hydrological model to identify regions likely to be exposed to drought, defined here as a location where the available soil moisture is projected to decline by the 2050s and 2080s relative to the mean soil moisture observed between 1990 and 2005. Second, we use agricultural, meteorological and socio-economic data to develop models of adaptive capacity and run these models to show where adaptive capacity is likely to decline by the 2050s and 2080s relative to the baseline period of 1990-2005. Third, we contrast the hydrological and adaptive capacity model outputs to identify "vulnerability hotspots" for wheat and maize. Here, a vulnerability hotspot is defined as a region that the models project as likely to experience both a decline in adaptive capacity and in available soil moisture. Results from the hydrological model project significant drying in many parts of the world overt the 21st century. Results from the adaptive capacity models show that regions with the lowest overall adaptive capacity for wheat include much of western Russia, northern India, southeastern South America, and southeastern Africa. In terms of maize, regions with the lowest adaptive capacity include the northeastern USA, southeastern South America, southeastern Africa, and central/northern India. When taken together, this study identifies five wheat and three maize growing regions likely to be both exposed to worse droughts and a reduced capacity to adapt. For wheat, these are: southeastern USA, southeastern South America, the northeastern Mediterranean, and parts of central Asia. For maize, our analysis suggests that vulnerability hotspots are: southeastern South America, parts of southern Africa, and the northeastern Mediterranean. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A quantitative understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions is vital for sustainable management of water quantity and quality. The noble gas radon-222 (Rn) is becoming increasingly used as a sensitive tracer to quantify groundwater discharge to wetlands, lakes, and rivers: a development driven by technical and methodological advances in Rn measurement. However, quantitative interpretation of these data is not trivial, and the methods used to date are based on the simplest solutions to the mass balance equation (e.g., first-order finite difference and inversion). Here we present a new implicit numerical model (FINIFLUX) based on finite elements for quantifying groundwater discharge to streams and rivers using Rn surveys at the reach scale (1-50 km). The model is coupled to a state-of-the-art parameter optimization code Parallel-PEST to iteratively solve the mass balance equation for groundwater discharge and hyporheic exchange. The major benefit of this model is that it is programed to be very simple to use, reduces non-uniqueness, and provides numerically stable estimates of groundwater fluxes and hyporheic residence times from field data. FINIFLUX was tested against an analytical solution and then implemented on two German rivers of differing magnitude, the Salzach (similar to 112 m(3) s(-1)) and the Rote Main (similar to 4 m(3) s(-1)). We show that using previous inversion techniques numerical instability can lead to physically impossible negative values, whereas the new model provides stable positive values for all scenarios. We hope that by making FINIFLUX freely available to the community that Rn might find wider application in quantifying groundwater discharge to streams and rivers and thus assist in a combined management of surface and groundwater systems.

AB  - More than 40% of irrigation water currently used in Tunisia is provided by groundwater aquifers, most of which are in a critical state of depletion due to its overexploitation during the last three decades. This paper provides a critical assessment of groundwater management in Tunisia based on interviews with key officials from central and regional administrations, in addition to farmers' questionnaires regarding attitudes and perceptions about different groundwater management instruments. Even though there is a consistent official groundwater management strategy in Tunisia, its enforcement is still problematic. Many regulatory and incentive instruments were adopted to manage groundwater but their effect was limited, partly due to the weak implementation capacities of the regional and local water administrations. Moreover, most farmers are not aware about the critical situation of this common pool resource and self-regulation initiatives are almost absent. From this assessment, we mainly conclude that the remaining activities for enhancing groundwater governance in Tunisia needs to rely on two main axes. The first is related to the improvement of administrative performances, particularly those for horizontal coordination of groundwater. The second is about investing in enhancing social capital supporting institutional changes; which is particularly necessary for the promotion of self-regulation initiatives.

AB  - In the Alto Beni region of Bolivia, as in other locations of the developing world, gravity-fed water supply systems provide a significant portion of domestic water needs. However, sustainability of these sources depends on whether discharge can be sustained to accommodate future water needs. There is a perception that agricultural expansion in the region is resulting in reduced spring discharge. To investigate this claim, we incorporate low-cost field methods for hydrologic data collection and evaluate two satellite-derived precipitation data products (CMORPH and TRMM-3B42) for input to a hydrological model used to predict recharge rates in eleven watersheds under scenarios of climate change and agricultural expansion. The stressors on the local water supply examined in this study are changes in land use and climate, along with increases in population and consumption, and improvements in water and sanitation coverage. Although predicted changes in runoff range from -69% to +137%, depending on the climate and land use scenario, recharge is predicted to decrease under all scenarios (by 28% to nearly 100%) between the periods of 1970-1999 and 2070-2099. The predicted impacts from climate change are considerably larger than those from agricultural expansion, calling into question local perceptions that spring flow has declined because of changes in land use from agricultural growth. The ratio of water use to availability under most scenarios of climate change and water and sanitation service expansion suggests that use of groundwater is sustainable in the region when considering the entire recharge to the watersheds. However, the small recharge areas of the springs may result in insufficient recharge to support planned water and sanitation expansion unless new water supplies are developed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper demonstrated the benefits of statistical methods when investigating the climatic and non-climatic drivers responsible for variations in groundwater recharge with a series of up to 43 years of annual recharge for 426 bores in South-East South Australia. We identified the factors influencing groundwater recharge based on 71 climatic metrics and 17 non-climatic metrics (including groundwater abstraction). The results showed: (1) Rainfall during April to October was the most important variable influencing recharge temporal variation, with its decline identified as the most significant factor related to recharge reduction; (2) In contrast, a negative correlation between rainfall during December to February (DJF) and annual groundwater recharge was found. This suggests that a seasonal shift in rainfall (such as decreasing rainfall during April to October and an increase during DJF) can result in a decline in recharge even when the annual rainfall remains unchanged; (3) The length of wet spells (consecutive rain days) and increasing potential evapotranspiration (PET) were additional significant predictors for recharge temporal variation. It demonstrated that a simple empirical relationship (such as recharge as a fixed percentage of rainfall) is not a reliable estimation of renewable groundwater resources under changing climatic conditions; (4) There is a statistically significant correlation between mean groundwater depth and recharge, which implies that if groundwater level fall due to rainfall declines then a positive feedback loop can lead to further recharge declines; (5) Spatially the most statistically significant factors influencing groundwater recharge were soil types and land attributes. The findings of this study can identify which stressors should be included when investigating the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge.

AB  - The shortage of water resources and the increasing competition among water users have highlighted the importance of the water allocation problem. Water availability is crucial for water resource allocation and changes frequently, leading to the necessity to predict available water. This paper develops a framework aimed to plan regional water allocations under different representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios using an interval parameter conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) two-stage stochastic programming model. This framework combines prediction and optimization to reflect climate change, the uncertainty of water system and the coordination between water resources allocation and risk. The feasibility and practicality of the framework are demonstrated by its application in a real-world case study in the Lower Songhua River Basin in northeast China. Comparison between the results of the developed model and actual conditions show that 11.61 x 10(8) m(3) volume of water supply can be saved after optimization, indicating that the developed model tends to allocate water in a more efficient way. The ratio of surface water to groundwater is reduced from 2:1 to 1.62:1. The proposed model has practical relevance for saving water and alleviating groundwater overexploitation. The approach is applicable to most areas with severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation, and decision makers can determine the appropriate options for water resources allocation based on risk preferences and actual conditions.

AB  - The Rincon Valley in arid, south-central New Mexico, is especially impacted by reduced surface water supply because the contribution of groundwater is limited by aquifer constraints. Consecutive surface water allotment shortages in the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID) have reduced recharge. The effects are compounded by farmers continuing to extract groundwater to meet crop requirements. Conjunctive use assumes aquifer resilience (i.e., ability to absorb pumping stress), but not necessarily in drought. This study further develops the water table fluctuation method by analyzing data from the EBID's groundwater monitoring program to reveal conjunctive use controls over the spatial and interannual variability of net storage changes from 2009 to 2016 in the Valley and introduces the term groundwater-surface water ratio of application (GSRA), that has potential for characterizing system resilience in conjunctive use settings. Regression modeling shows that variation in the annual EBID surface water allotment correlates strongly with year-end water table elevations, even more strongly than total annual groundwater extractions for irrigation, suggesting that variable surface water allotments are a primary driver of this system. Dewatering of the aquifer as of 2011 significantly altered the system hydrology such that from 2011 to 2016, net change in storage correlates strongly with the annual surface water allotment, corresponding to large river losses for the same period, but resulting in net gains in storage from 2014 to 2016. Rapid storage loss and rebound in this constrained aquifer system allowed quantification of aquifer resilience, enabling the development of a GSRA as a potential planning metric.

AB  - Irrigation along the Nile River has resulted in dramatic changes in the biophysical environment of Upper Egypt. In this study we used a combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data and Landsat imagery to identify areas that changed from 2001 to 2008 as a result of irrigation and water-level fluctuations in the Nile River and nearby waterbodies. We used two different methods of time series analysis principal components analysis (PCA) and harmonic decomposition - applied to the MODIS 250 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index images to derive simple three-class land-cover maps and then assessed their accuracy using a set of reference polygons derived from 30 m Landsat 5 and 7 imagery. We analysed our MODIS 250 m maps against a new MODIS global land-cover product (MOD12Q1 collection 5) to assess whether regionally specific mapping approaches are superior to a standard global product. Results showed that the accuracy of the PCA-based product was greater than the accuracy of either the harmonic decomposition or MOD12Q1 products for the years 2001, 2003 and 2008. However, the accuracy of the PCA product was only slightly better than the MOD12Q1 for 2001 and 2003. Overall, the results suggest that our PCA-based approach produces a high level of user and producer accuracies, although the MOD12Q1 product also showed consistently high accuracy. Overlay of 2001-2008 PCA-based maps showed a net increase of 12,129 ha of irrigated vegetation, with the largest increase found from 2006 to 2008 around the districts of Edfu and Kom Ombo. This result was unexpected in light of ambitious government plans to develop 336,000 ha of irrigated agriculture around the Toshka Lakes.

AB  - Understanding groundwater dynamics at the regional scale (> 100km) is essential to the development of sustainable water management regulations. Groundwater flow models are increasingly used to support these strategies. However, in order to be reliable, these models need to be calibrated and validated. The objective of this work is to evaluate the benefits and the limitations of using isotope-derived groundwater travel times and major ion chemistry to validate a regional-scale groundwater flow model in the humid continental climate of southern Quebec (Canada). A three-dimensional regional-scale steady-state groundwater model was created using MODFLOW for the fractured bedrock aquifer of the Centre-du-Quebec region (Quebec, Canada), using data acquired during recent aquifer characterization projects. The model covers an area of 7452 km(2), from the unconfined Appalachian Mountains to the confined St. Lawrence Platform. Groundwater travel times were simulated for 211 wells using particle tracking. The groundwater flow model was calibrated using 11,775 regionally distributed heads and 15 baseflow values. The model was validated using 23 H-3/He-3 residence time (3 to 60 years), 17 C-14 residence time (226 to 22,600 years), and the major ion compositions from 211 wells. Results indicate that the model is able to satisfactorily simulate H-3/He-3 isotopic residence time, while C-14 isotopic residence times are generally underestimated. These results suggest substantial mixing between groundwater recharged during the last deglaciation and recently recharged water. Regional groundwater flow is limited or absent, and most of the recharge discharges to the river network as baseflow. The analysis of travel times indicates a statistically distinct mean travel time for the different groundwater types. Median travel time is 68 years for recently recharged groundwater (Ca-HCO3), 274years for semi-confined groundwater (Na-HCO3), and 738 years for confined groundwater (Na-Cl). This confirms that groundwater chemistry is a broad indicator of groundwater travel time.

AB  - Aquifers are being threatened by overuse, and scenario predictions are convenient to design appropriate planning programs to water management. Numerical modeling is a helpful tool in these analyses, but it is hard to manage with limited data available, which is frequent in developing countries. The aim of the paper is to show that there are other simple and reliable options. The primary objective of this research is to propose and validate a simplified-to-available-data approach, useful for aquifer modeling, followed by scenarios' simulation, based on realistic future events. The Mexican overexploited aquifer Cuautitlan-Pachuca case study assess the responses of the water level under different outflows and infiltration scenarios from 2007 (base year) to 2031. Modflow software allowed the model calibration with 2007 data, and further spatial and temporal evolution of the piezometric level. The aquifer is the main water supplier for economic activities, and population in the northern region of Mexico City and outflows are continuously increasing, despite its severe overexploitation and even stronger negative impacts in the decline water levels are predicted in this study. A previous study reported -194.97 hm(3)/year deficit in 2010, and this paper predicts the strongest effect due to over-pumping caused by the population growth that would intensify the deficiency up to -236.29 hm(3)/year. The results have revealed to decision makers the urgency to prevent the aquifer's irreversible impairment, with a proper operation and management planning. This paper provides a contribution for simplifying conceptual models allowing to predict aquifers' outcome scenarios with limited data.

AB  - The extraction of groundwater can generate land subsidence by causing the compaction of susceptible aquifer systems, typically unconsolidated alluvial or basin-fill aquifer systems comprising aquifers and aquitards. Various ground-based and remotely sensed methods are used to measure and map subsidence. Many areas of subsidence caused by groundwater pumping have been identified and monitored, and corrective measures to slow or halt subsidence have been devised. Two principal means are used to mitigate subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal-reduction of groundwater withdrawal, and artificial recharge. Analysis and simulation of aquifer-system compaction follow from the basic relations between head, stress, compressibility, and groundwater flow and are addressed primarily using two approaches-one based on conventional groundwater flow theory and one based on linear poroelasticity theory. Research and development to improve the assessment and analysis of aquifer-system compaction, the accompanying subsidence and potential ground ruptures are needed in the topic areas of the hydromechanical behavior of aquitards, the role of horizontal deformation, the application of differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry, and the regional-scale simulation of coupled groundwater flow and aquifer-system deformation to support resource management and hazard mitigation measures.

AB  - We study geochemical processes along the variably-saturated zone during managed aquifer recharge (MAR) with reverse-osmosis desalinated seawater (DSW). The DSW, post-treated at the desalination plant by calcite dissolution (remineralization) to meet the Israeli water quality standards, is recharged into the Israeli Coastal Aquifer through an infiltration pond. Water quality monitoring during two MAR events using suction cups and wells inside the pond indicates that cation exchange is the dominant subsurface reaction, driven by the high Ca2+ concentration in the post-treated DSW. Stable isotope analysis shows that the shallow groundwater composition is similar to the recharged DSW, except for enrichment of Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+, and HCO3. A calibrated variably-saturated reactive transport model is used to predict the geochemical evolution during 50 years of MAR for two water quality scenarios: (i) post-treated DSW (current practice) and (ii) soft DSW (lacking the remineralization post-treatment process). The latter scenario was aimed to test soil-aquifer-treatment (SAT) as an alternative post-treatment technique. Both scenarios provide an enrichment of similar to 2.5 mg L-1 in Mg2+ due to cation exchange, compared to practically zero Mg2+ currently found in the Israeli DSW. Simulations of the alternative SAT scenario provide Ca2+ and HCO3 remineralization due to calcite dissolution at levels that meet the Israeli standard for DSW. The simulated calcite content reduction in the sediments below the infiltration pond after 50 years of MAR was low (<1%). Our findings suggest that remineralization using SAT for DSW is a potentially sustainable practice at MAR sites overlying calcareous sandy aquifers.

AB  - Groundwater trade is widely advocated for reallocating scarce groundwater resources between competing users, and managing over-allocated and declining aquifers. However, groundwater markets are still in their infancy, and the potential benefits and opportunities need investigation, particularly where there is a need to reduce the extraction from declining aquifers. This article evaluates economic impacts of reducing groundwater extraction for irrigation use in peri-urban Perth, Australia, where irrigation, a lake-based ecosystem, and public water supply are highly dependent on a declining groundwater resource. We present an assessment of market-based water trading approaches to reduce groundwater extraction with an economic model representing diversity in returns to groundwater use across a population of irrigators. The results indicate that potential economic costs of a proportional reduction in available groundwater for irrigation are 18-21% less if groundwater trade is possible. We also evaluate a water buyback from irrigation to provide public water supply as an alternative to new infrastructure. We find that buying back up to around 50% of current irrigation allocations could create new public water supply only at the cost of $0.32-0.39 million per GL, which is less than one fifth of the costs of new desalinisation or recycled water supply options ($2-3 million per GL). We conclude that, with rapid development of computer and internet based trading platforms that allows fast, efficient and low cost multiple party trading, it is increasingly feasible to realise the economic potentials of market-based trade approaches for managing overexploited aquifers.

AB  - Seawater desalination is a promising approach to satisfying water demand in coastal countries suffering from water scarcity. To clarify its potential future global scale, we perform a detailed investigation of the economic feasibility of desalination development for different countries using a feasibility index (F-i) that reflects a comparison between the price of water and the cost of production. We consider both past and future time periods. For historical validation, F-i is first evaluated for nine major desalination countries; its variation is in good agreement with the actual historical development of desalination in these countries on both spatial and temporal scales. We then simulate the period of 2015-2050 for a Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2) and two climate scenarios. Our projected results suggest that desalination will become more feasible for countries undergoing continued development by 2050. The corresponding total global desalination population will increase by 3.2-fold in 2050 compared to the present (from 551.6 x 10(6) in 2015 to 1768 x 10(6)). The major spread of seawater desalination to more countries and its availability to larger populations is mainly attributed to the diminishing production costs and increasing water prices in these countries under the given socioeconomic/climate scenarios.

AB  - Salt transport in soil profile and shallow groundwater changes are significant seasonal response to flood irrigation in arid area. Understanding soil salt and groundwater level change is useful to determine irrigation schedule and agricultural development. In this study, based on observation data at six fixed sites from 2007 to 2010, soil salt and groundwater depths change were investigated in irrigation fields and uncultivated lands of upper, middle and lower reaches in the arid irrigation district of Hetao irrigation district. The results indicated that the fluctuation of soil salinity in each layer in irrigation fields was more frequent, while the soil salinity in uncultivated lands presented a surface accumulation phenomenon. The groundwater level had similar trends in 4 years and the groundwater changed gradually deeper from upstream to downstream. Meanwhile, relationships between soil surface salinity and groundwater depth were various for irrigation field and uncultivated land. Furthermore, the groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration were calculated with water table fluctuation method. In all the crop growth periods, the influence of groundwater recharge on evapotranspiration was significant. For the irrigation fields, the mean contributions of groundwater to evapotranspiration of 4 years in upper, middle and lower reaches were 25.57, 11.96 and 15.23 %, respectively, while the values were 53.92, 21.61 and 36.84 % at the uncultivated land, respectively. The results can contribute to determine the water resources management plan for sustainable development of the irrigation district with shallow groundwater.

AB  - The distribution and amount of groundwater, a crucial source of Earth's drinking and irrigation water, is changing due to climate-change effects. Therefore, it is important to understand groundwater behavior in extreme scenarios, e.g. drought. Shallow groundwater (SGW) level fluctuation under natural conditions displays periodic behavior, i.e. seasonal variation. Thus, the study aims to investigate (1) the periodic behavior of the SGW level time series of an agriculturally important and drought-sensitive region in Central-Eastern Europe - the Carpathian Basin, in the north-eastern part of the Great Hungarian Plain, and (2) its relationship to the European atmospheric pressure action centers. Data from 216 SGW wells were studied using wavelet spectrum analysis and wavelet coherence analyses for 1961-2010. Locally, a clear relationship exists between the absence of annual periodic behavior in the SGW level and the periodicity of droughts, as indicated by the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index and the Aridity Index. During the non-periodic intervals, significant drops in groundwater levels (average 0.5 m) were recorded in 89% of the wells. This result links the meteorological variables to the periodic behavior of SGW, and consequently, drought. On a regional scale, Mediterranean cyclones from the Gulf of Genoa (northwest Italy) were found to be a driving factor in the 8-yr periodic behavior of the SGW wells. The research documents an important link between SGW levels and local/regional climate variables or indices, thereby facilitating the necessary adaptation strategies on national and/or regional scales, as these must take into account the predictions of drought-related climatic conditions.

This work analyzed the repercussions that alternative irrigation management can cause on water use and on the quality of irrigation return flows. The case of Bardenas Canal Irrigation District no. V (ID-V) was studied, by analyzing the change of salinity and nitrate concentration in the drainage network through monthly samplings, before (2000) and after (2007) ID-V implanted alternative flood irrigation management. The results showed that the electric conductivity (25 C) and nitrate concentration in the drainage ditches increased in 2007 (0.99 dS/m and 62 mg/l) with respect to 2000 (0.86 dS/m and 57 mg/l). Nevertheless, the decrease in irrigation drainage in 2007 (88% lower in 2007 when compared to that of 2000) was a result of the decrease in water requirement (594 mm in 2007 against 752 mm in 2000) and of the increase in irrigation efficiency (93% in 2007 and 67% in 2000), causing the Riguel River to present a lower flow (13% inferior when compared with 2000), lower salinity (1.08 dS/m in 2007 and 1.18 dS/m in 2000), and lower nitrate concentration (29 mg/l in 2007 and 33 mg/l in 2000) when exiting ID-V in 2007. In summary, simple alternatives in irrigation management achieved an increment of 26% in water use, decreasing by 20% and 24% the salt and nitrate masses exported, respectively, ameliorating the quality of the system receiving the irrigation return flows (Riguel River).

AB  - We present a new technique for identifying and quantifying the discharge of long residence time, regional groundwater to rivers using naturally occurring tracers measured within the river. Terrigenic He-4 and Rn-222, synoptically sampled along a 100 km reach in the Fitzroy River in northern Western Australia, are used to identify areas of groundwater inflow to the river and to distinguish shallow, local and deep, regional groundwater. Models of tracer transport in the river can be numerically optimized to calculate total groundwater discharge and to separate regional and local discharge fractions. Discharge of regional groundwater composes close to 15% of the total groundwater discharge along the entire reach, varying spatially along the reach from 0% to 100% of total groundwater discharge. This method should be applicable in river systems where groundwater with elevated terrigenic helium could be discharging to the river. The ability to separate locally from regionally derived groundwater discharge has significant implications for calculating catchment water budgets, for predicting catchment response to changes in precipitation, and for sustainable management of the catchment.

AB  - Population pressure, urbanization, and industrial developments, among other factors, have resulted in severe degradation of environmental resources such as wetlands. Thus, a groundwater model (MODFLOW) was integrated with a particle tracking MODPATH model to simulate the hydrodynamic flow head field and to analyze the vulnerability of the Salburua ecosystem and propose control measures to protect the riparian area. The simulations show that pathways of particle tracking originating at potential contaminant sources will tend to migrate downwards towards the sensitive ecosystem, which suggests that the quality of the hydrological ecosystem is likely to deteriorate in the future. Variation in exit points of particles indicates that the time-related capture areas are affected by changes of the hydraulic gradients. Two control measures of potential sources of pollutants in the vicinity of the Salbarua ecosystem were analyzed. The study results suggest that the travel time-related capture zone with a funnel-and-gate system is much smaller than without the control alternative, which indicates that the gate configuration has an effect on capture zone size and shape and on the residence time with a better attenuation performance. It is also shown that a leakage-proof barrier is less effective for point-source containment, assuming that hydraulic control performance and cost-efficiency are the criteria for pollution control effectiveness. Instead, a program of monitoring wells would effectively characterize water quality in the aquifer and provide a decision support system. This approach may be used in helping water managers to develop more physically based and quantitative protection strategies.

AB  - Agricultural water management (AWM) is the adaptation strategy for increasing agricultural production through enhancing water resources availability while maintaining ecosystem services. This study characterizes groundwater hydrology in the Kothapally agricultural watershed, in hard rock Deccan plateau area in India and assesses the impact of AWM interventions on groundwater recharge using a calibrated and validated hydrological model, SWAT, in combination with observed water table data in 62 geo-referenced open wells. Kothapally receives, on average, 750 mm rainfall (nearly 90% of annual rainfall) during the monsoon season (June to October). Water balance showed that 72% of total rainfall was converted as evapotranspiration (ET), 16% was stored in aquifer, and 8% exported as runoff from the watershed boundary with AWM interventions. Nearly 60% of the runoff harvested by AWM interventions recharged shallow aquifers and rest of the 40% increased ET. Water harvesting structures (WHS) contributed 2.5 m additional head in open wells, whereas hydraulic head under natural condition was 3.5 m, resulting in total 6 m rise in water table during the monsoon. At the field scale, WHSs recharged open wells at a 200 to 400 m spatial scale.

AB  - Water markets are a prime example of decentralised resource allocation, yet their success often depends on strong coordination institutions, particularly as water is redistributed across sectors and political borders. The territorial division of authority in federal countries creates potential intergovernmental coordination challenges in river basins shared by multiple jurisdictions. This paper compares water markets and associated institutional reforms in Australia, Spain and the Western USA-three countries with long-standing experience with water markets but different approaches to distributing authority and intergovernmental coordination. We conduct an institutional mapping of national and sub-national roles in market-based water allocation reforms across the three countries and employ process tracing techniques to examine coordination challenges and institutional responses associated with water markets. We find that (1) policy goals addressed by water markets vary across-and within-the three countries, reflecting differences in the level of decentralisation, but (2) all three countries have required capable coordination institutions to address the distributional conflicts associated with water markets. Coordination institutions can take multiple forms and include both formal and informal venues for planning, financing and conflict management matched to local conditions.

AB  - The Geba basin is one of the most water-stressed areas of Ethiopia, with only a short rainy period from mid-June to mid-September. Because rainfall in this region has been consistently erratic in the last decades, both in time and space, rain-fed agriculture has become problematic. Hence, in order to supplement rain-fed agriculture by irrigation, a detailed understanding of local and regional surface water and groundwater resources is important. The main objective of this study is to assess the available water resources in the Geba basin using a spatially distributed water balance model (WetSpass). Relevant input data for the model is prepared in the form of digital maps using remote sensing images, GIS tools, FAO and NASA databases, field reconnaissance and processing of meteorological and hydrological observations. The model produces digital maps of long-term average, seasonal and annual surface runoff, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Results of the model show that 76% of the precipitation in the basin is lost through evapotranspiration, 18% becomes surface runoff and only 6% recharges the groundwater system. Model predictions are verified against river flow observations and are shown to be reliable. Additional maps are derived of accumulated surface runoff, safe yield for groundwater abstraction and water deficit for crop growth. Comparison of existing reservoirs with the accumulated runoff map shows that many reservoirs have failed because their design capacity is much higher than the actual inflow. Comparison of the safe yield map with the crop water deficit map shows that in most areas groundwater can be safely abstracted to supplement the water deficit for crop growth during the wet summer season. However, in the dry winter season the crop water deficit is too high to be supplemented by groundwater abstraction in a sustainable way. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding groundwater abstraction effects is vital for holistic impact assessments in areas depending on groundwater resources. The objective of our study was to modify the state-of-the-art AWaRe (available water remaining), freshwater impact assessment specifically for use in LCAs in areas dependent on groundwater resources. The new method, called "AGWaRe" (available groundwater remaining), reflects groundwater availability, based on a fraction of available groundwater remaining locally relative to a reference. Furthermore, our method increases spatial resolution beyond 1770 km(2) grid cells and adjusts demarcations in order to improve the representation of the heterogeneity of groundwater catchments. The applicability of AGWaRe was demonstrated on three groundwater systems producing 5 million m(3) water for the city of Copenhagen, namely Advanced Treatment of Groundwater, Simple Treatment of Groundwater and Infiltration of Reclaimed water. Results were normalised to compare with other effects of supplying water to an average Danish person. The normalised impacts for drinking water for one person ranged between 0.1 and 39 PE (person equivalent) for the three systems, which indicates that effects on groundwater resources differ substantially between systems. A comparative LCA of these groundwater systems shows that other impact categories range between 0 and 1 PE/person. Advanced Treatment of Groundwater generally has the lowest effect, for example < 50% of the other groundwater systems in Global Warming Potential. The AGWaRe results indicate that freshwater impacts from Simple Treatment of Groundwater are up to 100 times greater than for Infiltration of Reclaimed water. Furthermore, AGWaRe exposes differences between the groundwater systems that AWaRe cannot evaluate, because one AWaRe cell covers two of the systems in question. These improvements are crucial for groundwater managers looking to include sustainability considerations in their analysis and decision-making.

AB  - Groundwater is a resilient water source and its importance is even greater in periods of drought. Areas such as the Mediterranean where adverse climate change effects are expected are bell-weather locations for groundwater depletion and are of considerable interest. The present study evaluates renewable groundwater stress (RGS) as the ratio of groundwater use to groundwater availability, quantifying use as the trend in gravity recovery and climate experiment-derived (GRACE) subsurface anomalies (Delta GW(trend)) and renewable groundwater availability as mean annual recharge. Estimates for mean annual recharge for the various regions in Greece have been derived using numerical models. Our results highlight two RGS regimes in Greece (variable stress and unstressed) of the four characteristic stress regimes, that is, overstressed, variable stress, human-dominated stress, and unstressed, defined as a function of the sign of use and the sign of groundwater availability (positive or negative). Variable stress areas are found in Central Greece (Thessaly region), where intensive agriculture results in negative Delta GW(trend) values combined with positive mean annual recharge rates. RGS values range from -0.05 to 0, indicating a low impact area. Within this region, adverse effects of groundwater overexploitation are already evident based on the negative GRACE anomalies; however, recharge is still positive, mitigating the effects of over-pumping. The rest of Greek aquifers fall within the unstressed category, with RGS values from 0.02 to 0.05, indicating that the rate of use is less than the natural recharge rate.

AB  - This study presents a capillary-pressure saturation (P(C)-S) constitutive model that incorporates the capillary phenomena necessary for simulating the spatial distribution of nonwetting fluid migrating in a saturated porous medium. To develop a model validation data set, a sequence of dense, nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) pools were emplaced, under alternating drainage and imbibition conditions, in a one-dimensional, 1 m tall, saturated sand pack. A light transmission/image analysis system successfully distinguished between connected-phase and residual nonwetting fluid in the apparatus, thereby permitting the accurate measurement of DNAPL pool heights. These heights are found to depend on the nonzero capillary pressure across the fluid-fluid interface at the top of the pool. The terminal pressure is demonstrated to be the minimum sustainable capillary pressure in connected-phase nonwetting fluid experiencing imbibition, below which residual is formed. Additional bench-scale experiments demonstrate that a nonwetting phase pool will penetrate an underlying capillary barrier when the entry pressure is exceeded and that the resulting infiltration will terminate when the capillary pressure at the barrier reduces to the terminal pressure. At the macroscopic scale the terminal pressure corresponds to the extinction saturation (i.e., zero nonwetting phase flow) at the inflection point on the imbibition P(C)-S curve. A ratio of terminal to entry pressure of approximately 0.6 is found to apply at both bench and macroscopic scales and to be independent of porous media and fluid properties. The developed P(C)-S constitutive model, which extends the Brooks-Corey function to incorporate the terminal pressure, successfully predicted the behavior observed in the laboratory experiments. Constitutive models that do not incorporate both an entry and a terminal pressure, such as those based upon the standard van Genuchten function, are demonstrated to be unable to predict the observed equilibrium DNAPL pool heights in homogeneous media or above capillary barriers.

AB  - Quantity and quality distribution of surface water and groundwater are changing under the impacts of both climate variability and human activities. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the abovementioned impacts on the water resources in the Saveh plain, central Iran. To achieve this aim, spatial and temporal changes of the surface and groundwater quality and quantity have been analyzed, using hydrometric and meteorological data. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was used to identify trends and change points in the annual rainfall and runoff for the period of 1946 to 2011. In order to analyze the impacts of the Saveh Dam on runoff, the dam operation year, 1994, was considered as a change point. Mann-Kendall test results show that rainfall time series was divided into two parts, namely, 1966-1989 and 1990-2007, and averages of annual rainfall in five stations increase from 10 to 21 %. Also, runoff time series was divided into two parts, namely, 1946-1995 and 1996-2007 and averages of annual runoff in four stations decrease from 8 to 83 %. Results show that rainfall changes in Shahabasi, Razin, Jalayer, Emamabad, and Ahmadabad stations increased from 9 to 33% before and after 1994. Nevertheless, runoff decreased from 24 to 81 %. The results indicate that the greatest lack of runoff between stations is at Shahabasi station and one important reason for the severe lack is operation of the Saveh Dam in 1994. Highest groundwater level decline, about 168.67 cm, occurred in 1994 that is the operation year of the Saveh Dam. Trend analysis of surface water quality show that electrical conductivity increased 957.34 mu mho/cm before and after 1994. Also, the Wilcox water quality classification method has been reduced from C3-S1 to C4-S2. Average groundwater electrical conductivity (EC) during 1999-2003 and 2004-2009 increased to 89.6 mu mho/cm. Also, the groundwater quality indices for agricultural usages are classified in four classes including, C4-S2 16, C4-S1 46, C3-S1 30, and C2-S1 8 % of the total aquifer area. In conclusion, in order to have a sustainable development, the effects of water projects on environment and water resources need to be predicted very carefully.

AB  - The embedding optimization modeling approach is adapted to aid sustainable groundwater quantity and quality management of complex nonlinear multilayer aquifers. Implicit block-centered finite difference approximations of the quasi three-dimensional unsteady flow equation and Galerkin finite element approximations of the two-dimensional advection-dispersion transport equation are embedded directly as constraints in the model. Also used are nonlinear constraints describing river-aquifer interflow, evapotranspiration, and vertical flow reduction due to unconfinement. These circumvent use of large numbers of integer variables. The use of both linear and nonlinear formulations in a cyclical manner reduces execution time and improves confidence in solution optimality. The methodology is demonstrated for Salt Lake valley where groundwater quantity and quality management are needed, the proportion of pumping cells and cells needing head constraint is large, and many flows are described by discrete nonlinear or piecewise linear functions.

AB  - Sustainable development of the earth's limited water and land resources is of paramount importance because of rising world population and existing conflicting demands for these resources. Enormous capital investment has been made in developing these resources, but now there is irrefutable evidence that such developments have led to major resource degradation. This includes problems of salinisation and damages to ecosystems. The countries predominantly affected by human induced salinisation are located in arid and semi-arid regions of the world and include Australia, China, Egypt, India, Pakistan, USSR, and USA. This paper describes the processes of salinisation, its impacts and the use of quantitative methods in salinity investigation and management. Australia is used as a case study of typical salinity problems and as a demonstration of the fruitful application of quantitative methods. The paper concludes that quantitative methods such as surface water and groundwater models are powerful design, management and predictive tools in salinity investigation. However, application of some models, such as those for unsaturated flow and transport and groundwater solute transport, are not widespread due to uncertainties in describing the complexity of the processes and the lack of hydrodispersive data.

AB  - The Porto Torres (NW Sardinia) coastal aquifer is hosted in the carbonate rocks of the Miocene succession, which fills a NNW oriented half-graben. This aquifer is an important contributor to the fresh water supply of the local area. It is increasingly being degraded by salinization processes, mainly associated with intense groundwater over-exploitation. A combined hydrochemical and hydrogeological study has been carried out to identify the origin of the salinity in the groundwater. The behavior of the major ions showed that the changes in the chemical composition of the groundwater have been mainly controlled by the encroachment of seawater, accompanied by cation exchange reactions. Since seawater intrusion is a dynamic process, an Hydrochemical Facies Evolution Diagram, HFE-D (Gimenez Forcada, 2010) approach was taken to establish whether the aquifer was in the seawater intrusion or in the freshening phase. The assessment model developed provides regional authorities with a basic tools for sustainable water management in the framework of multi-disciplinary research activities aiming to combat and/or mitigate desertification and land degradation processes.

AB  - The present work deals with the groundwater aquifer of the Lower Cretaceous sandstone and its sustainable development in Sinai. The studied aquifer system is the most promising groundwater system in Sinai due to its wide extension, hug storage, and good quality. The objective of this paper aims to elucidate the hydrogeological characteristics of the Lower Cretaceous aquifer. The aquifer system occurs under confined conditions. The top surface of the Lower Cretaceous dips steeply towards the southwest direction with step faults. The average sand percent of the penetrated aquifer attains 54%. The main direction of groundwater flow is generally from southwest and locally is concentric to the center of study area related to the influence of the graben block. The aquifer has a hydraulic gradient generally reaches 0.0011 m/m and attains 0.0028 in central portion of study area. The aquifer parameters (effective porosity, transmissivity, and hydraulic conductivity) increase towards the northeast direction with increasing of the sand percentage. Durov diagram plot revealed that the groundwater has been a final stage evolution represented by a NaCl water type. The groundwater salinity increases towards the central of study area coinciding with groundwater flow. The groundwater salinity of the Lower Cretaceous aquifer is brackish water and varies from 2,510 to 5,256 ppm and unsuitable for drinking and domestic purposes.

AB  - Ecological thresholds that lead to alternative community states can be exceeded through gradual perturbation or as a result of sudden disturbance. Many Great Plains streams have experienced dramatic changes in their hydrologic regime resulting from water and landuse changes that began as early as 1880. These changes, combined with the presence of many invasive species, have substantially altered the fish communities in this area. We quantified temporal changes in fish communities in 3 large river basins in relation to putative anthropogenic stressors, including increased sediment supply derived from row-crop agriculture (beginning in 1880), habitat fragmentation caused by reservoir construction (beginning in the 1950s), and reduced discharge caused by groundwater withdrawal (beginning in the 1960s). We hypothesized that these abiotic regime shifts, coupled with species invasions, would shift the system from a fish community dominated by lotic (flowing water) species to one dominated by lentic (still water) species. Further, we predicted that the timing and intensity of community change would vary across basins that experienced different types and levels of stressors. Restructuring of fish communities across the 3 river basins was driven primarily by similar increases in lentic species, with only a few declines in several large-river species. Current fish communities in these basins share <50% of the species recorded in historic collections, and these differences were driven by species extirpations and invasions. The greatest levels of community divergence over time occurred in western Kansas basins that experienced the most intense groundwater withdrawals and fragmentation by reservoirs. An alarming result from this analysis was the recent (after 1991) expansion of several invasive species in the Arkansas and lower Kansas River basins and the decline or extirpation of several native species where flow regimes are less heavily altered. Accelerating changes in the biota and habitat identified by our retrospective analysis highlight potential complications for restoring the habitat and native fish communities to a previous state.

AB  - Pressure on limited water resources and the environment requires better understanding of how landscape change impacts river flow. Rainfall-runoff models have traditionally focused on estimating total river flows with less emphasis on modelling the groundwater component or the consequences of different land-use change scenarios. In this paper, we present the GWlag model, a water-generation model that predicts river flows with explicit accounting of the impacts of catchment land-use change and surface groundwater interactions. The paper firstly describes the theory that underpins the model and its calibration then presents a case study application in the Tarcutta Creek catchment of the Murray Darling Basin, Australia. The case study aims at: (i) demonstrating the ability of the model to predict daily river flows; (ii) modelling the impacts of hypothetical plantation forestry expansions on river flows; and (iii) showing the impacts of reduced recharge on the low-flow regime using three indices, namely, Q(90)/Q(50) (where Q(n) refers to nth percentile flow), slope of low-flow part of flow duration curve, and % of zero-flow days. Results showed that predicted flows agreed favourably to those observed at the gauge especially during low-flow conditions. The hypothetical plantation expansion from 32% to 87% of the catchment area has resulted in reductions of 48% and 32%, in Q(50) and Q(20), respectively. The low-flow indices demonstrated the great sensitivity of low flow to reductions in recharge with the trend of the low-flow response changing to non-linear for recharge reductions beyond 10%. GWlag daily river flow predictions compared favourably to those obtained from four other rainfall-runoff models in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (E). However, GWlag produced the highest E-value for log-transformed flows thus highlighting the model's superior predictive capability during low-flow conditions.

AB  - In northern Victoria, farmers are the biggest users of groundwater and therefore the main stakeholders in plans that seek to sustainably manage the resource. Interviews with 30 irrigation farmers in two study areas, analysed using qualitative social research methods, showed that the overwhelming majority of groundwater users agreed with the need for groundwater management and thought that the current plans had achieved sustainable resource use. The farmers also expressed a strong need for clear technical explanations for management decisions, in particular easily understood water level data. The social licence to implement the management plans arose through effective consultation with the community during plan development. Several additional factors combined to gain acceptance for the plans: good data on groundwater usage and aquifer levels is available; irrigation farmers had been exposed to usage restrictions since the late 1990s; an 'adaptive' management approach is in use which allowed refinements to be readily incorporated and fortuitously, plan development coincided with the 1998-2009 drought, when declines in groundwater levels reinforced the usefulness of the plans. The imposition of a nation-wide water use reduction plan in 2012 had relatively little impact in Victoria because of the early implementation of effective groundwater management plans. However, economic difficulties that reduce groundwater users' capacity to pay groundwater management charges mean that the future of the plans in Victoria is not assured. Nevertheless, the high level of trust that exists between Victorian irrigation farmers and the management agencies suggests that the continued use of a consultative approach will continue to produce workable outcomes. Lessons from the Victorian experience may be difficult to apply in other areas of groundwater use in Australia and overseas, where there may be a quite different history of development and culture of groundwater management.

AB  - This study investigated the use of three-dimensional (3D) geological methods to provide better groundwater resource estimates for the Spring Hill area in central Victoria, Australia. Geological data were gathered in 3D geological software, which was utilised to derive fundamental dimensional parameters of the groundwater system in the study area. Mining industry software and hydrogeological methods were combined to give volumetric determinations of the basalt aquifer that were used to improve estimates of the groundwater resource. The methods reduce uncertainty about the physical attributes of the aquifer systems and greatly improve conceptual understanding of their behaviour. A simple numerical water-balance model was developed to refine the estimates of aquifer volume and fluxes to approximate observed water-level behaviour in the area. This enabled a much better comparison of groundwater resource use to the natural inputs and outputs for the area. A key conclusion was that the main issues for sustainable development and use in the study area are more to do with the physical aspects of the aquifer system, rather than simply the volume of water pumped. Visualisations of the area's hydrogeology also provide improved hydrogeological understanding and communication for groundwater users and administrators.

AB  - In Victoria, Australia, most groundwater resources are now fully allocated and opportunities for new groundwater development can only occur through trading of license entitlements. Groundwater usage has rarely exceeded 50% of the available licensed volume, even in the 2008/9 drought year, and 50 to 70% of individual license holders use less than 5% of their allocation each year. However, little groundwater trading is occurring at present. Interviews were conducted with groundwater license holders and water brokers to investigate why the Victorian groundwater trade market is underdeveloped. Responses show there is a complex mix of social, economic, institutional and technical reasons. Barriers to trade are influenced by the circumstances of each groundwater user, administrative process and resource management rules. Water brokers deal with few trades at low margins and noted unrealistic selling prices and administrative difficulties. Irrigators who have successfully traded identify that there are few participants in trading, technical appraisals are expensive and administrative requirements and fees are burdensome, especially when compared to surface water trading. Opportunities to facilitate trade include groundwater management plan refinement and improved information provision. Simplifying transaction processes and costs, demonstrating good resource stewardship and preventing third party impacts from trade could address some concerns raised by market participants. There are, however, numerous individual circumstances that inhibit groundwater trading, so it is unlikely that policy and process changes alone could increase usage rates without greater demand for groundwater or more favourable farming economic circumstances.

AB  - The occurrence of pesticides in groundwater of the Chateauguay River watershed was investigated. The Chateauguay River is an important tributary of the St. Lawrence River. In this exploratory project, conducted between August and October 2005, water samples were collected from 57 rural domestic wells. Among them, 15 were located near apple orchards, 22 near vegetables production centres, and 20 near corn or soybean fields. In the Chateauguay River watershed, each type of crop is related to a specific hydrogeologic setting. Apple orchards are grown in sandy and gravelly soils in areas of moderate topography. Vegetables are grown in organic-rich soils, whereas corn and soybean are grown mainly in the clay-rich soils of the St. Lawrence plain. Low concentrations of pesticides were detected in 13 of the 57 wells sampled (23%); seven in clay soils near corn and soybean crops, and six in organic soils near vegetables crops. Surprisingly, no pesticides were detected in the wells situated in the most vulnerable zones near apple orchards. Detected pesticides include the herbicides atrazine, metolachlor, linuron, diuron, and metribuzin; the insecticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon; and the fungicide chlorothalonil. Concentrations for all pesticides detected in the wells are below drinking water guidelines.

AB  - Hyperarid, arid, and semi-arid lands represent over a third of the Earth's land surface, and are home to over 38 % of the increasing world population. Freshwater is a limiting resource on these lands, and withdrawal of groundwater substantially exceeds recharge. Withdrawals of groundwater for expanding agricultural and domestic use severely limit water availability for groundwater dependent ecosystems. We examine here, with emphasis on quantitative data, case histories of groundwater withdrawals at widely differing scales, on three continents, that range from the impact of a few wells, to the outcomes of total appropriation of flow in a major river system. The case histories provide a glimpse of the immense challenge of replacing groundwater resources once they are severely depleted, and put into sharp focus the question whether the magnitude of the current and future human, economic, and environmental consequences and costs of present practices of groundwater exploitation are adequately recognized.

AB  - Hydrogeology is now taught in a broad spectrum of departments and institutions to students with diverse backgrounds. Successful instruction in hydrogeology thus requires a variety of pedagogical approaches depending on desired learning outcomes and the background of students. We review the pedagogical literature in hydrogeology to highlight recent advances and analyze a 2005 survey among 68 hydrogeology instructors. The literature and survey results suggest there are only similar to 15 topics that are considered crucial by most hydrogeologists and > 100 other topics that are considered crucial by some hydrogeologists. The crucial topics focus on properties of aquifers and fundamentals of groundwater flow, and should likely be part of all undergraduate hydrogeology courses. Other topics can supplement and support these crucial topics, depending on desired learning outcomes. Classroom settings continue to provide a venue for emphasizing fundamental knowledge. However, recent pedagogical advances are biased towards field and laboratory instruction with a goal of bolstering experiential learning. Field methods build on the fundamentals taught in the classroom and emphasize the collection of data, data uncertainty, and the development of vocational skills. Laboratory and computer-based exercises similarly build on theory, and offer an opportunity for data analysis and integration. The literature suggests curricula at all levels should ideally balance field, laboratory, and classroom pedagogy into an iterative and integrative whole. An integrated, iterative and balanced approach leads to greater student motivation and advancement of theoretical and vocational knowledge.

AB  - The sustainability of crucial earth resources, such as groundwater, is a critical issue. We consider groundwater sustainability a value-driven process of intra-and intergenerational equity that balances the environment, society, and economy. Synthesizing hydrogeological science and current sustainability concepts, we emphasize three sustainability approaches: setting multigenerational sustainability goals, backcasting, and managing adaptively. As most aquifer problems are long-term problems, we propose that multigenerational goals (50 to 100 years) for water quantity and quality that acknowledge the connections between groundwater, surface water, and ecosystems be set for many aquifers. The goals should be set by a watershed-or aquifer-based community in an inclusive and participatory manner. Policies for shorter time horizons should be developed by backcasting, and measures implemented through adaptive management to achieve the long-term goals. Two case histories illustrate the importance and complexity of a multigenerational perspective and adaptive management. These approaches could transform aquifer depletion and contamination to more sustainable groundwater use, providing groundwater for current and future generations while protecting ecological integrity and resilience.

AB  - Groundwater is a life-sustaining resource that supplies water to billions of people, plays a central part in irrigated agriculture and influences the health of many ecosystems(1,2). Most assessments of global water resources have focused on surface water(3-6), but unsustainable depletion of groundwater has recently been documented on both regional(7,8) and global scales(9-11). It remains unclear how the rate of global groundwater depletion compares to the rate of natural renewal and the supply needed to support ecosystems. Here we define the groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater-dependent ecosystem services) and show that humans are overexploiting groundwater in many large aquifers that are critical to agriculture, especially in Asia and North America. We estimate that the size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3.5 times the actual area of aquifers and that about 1.7 billion people live in areas where groundwater resources and/or groundwater-dependent ecosystems are under threat. That said, 80 per cent of aquifers have a groundwater footprint that is less than their area, meaning that the net global value is driven by a few heavily overexploited aquifers. The groundwater footprint is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the use, renewal and ecosystem requirements of groundwater at an aquifer scale. It can be combined with the water footprint and virtual water calculations(12-14), and be used to assess the potential for increasing agricultural yields with renewable groundwaterref(15). The method could be modified to evaluate other resources with renewal rates that are slow and spatially heterogeneous, such as fisheries, forestry or soil.

AB  - Agricultural production in India has become increasingly reliant on groundwater and this has resulted in depletion of groundwater resources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) for groundwater recharge is seen as one of the solutions to solve the groundwater problem. This is reflected in an increase in watershed development programs, in which RWH is an important structural component. Understanding the net effect of these development programs is crucial to ensure that net effect on groundwater is positive both locally and within a watershed. Hence, this review focuses on the hydrological impacts of RWH for recharge at the local (individual structure) and watershed scale in rural areas. Surprisingly little field evidence of the stated positive impacts at the local scale is available, and there are several potential negative impacts at the watershed scale. The watershed scale is underrepresented in the field studies and is mainly approached through modelling. Modelling is seen as a possible tool to extend limited field data and scenario studies can be used to examine potential impacts. However, many past modelling studies examining RWH have either had limited focus or have been based on insufficient data. Development of new modelling tools is needed in combination with increased field data collection. Increased use of remote sensing and advanced statistical techniques are suggested as possible new opportunities. In addition, some evaluation criteria are proposed to assess the local and watershed scale hydrological, and other, impacts of RWH as part of watershed development. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Songaksan tuffring, Jeju Island, Korea, which erupted ca. 3.7 ka BP in a coastal setting, provides an unusual opportunity to study the processes of phreatomagmatic eruption and the formation of a diatreme because of the exceptionally well-preserved ejecta beds and well-known subsurface geology. The tuff sequence can be divided into four units (A to D), which have distinctly different accidental componentry (quartz-rich vs. quartz-poor), grain surface features (abraded and ash-coated vs. unabraded and uncoated), and chemical compositions of juvenile particles. The basal tephra bed of unit A, which probably erupted after the removal of the relatively hard shallow-level (<120 m deep) substrate by initial cratering, comprises only unabraded and uncoated grains and contains abundant relatively deep- derived (>120 m deep) accidental grains, suggesting that the early erupted tephra had not yet experienced recycling and pre-eruption mixing in the diatreme. On the other hand, the overlying tephra beds of units A, B, and D contain an abundance of abraded and ash-coated juvenile/accidental grains, suggesting that the tephra comprised significant proportions of "recycled" or "premixed" materials from previous eruptions or subsurface explosions, which participated in the explosion-driven mixing in the diatreme before eventual ejection from the diatreme. Unit C is unusual in that it comprises extremely rare accidental grains and ash-coated juvenile/accidental grains. We interpret that the supply of solid materials, either accidental or juvenile, to the diatreme was greatly reduced because of temporary stabilization of the diatreme and the reduction in magma flux to the diatreme. The diatreme is therefore envisaged to have been filled with a water-saturated slurry, in which particle abrasion and adhesion were inhibited. We also infer that the diatreme fill was temporarily removed by a powerful explosion before eruption of unit C on the basis of the near absence of the tephra grains from earlier eruptions throughout the tephra beds of unit C. The ratio of tachylite to sideromelane grains generally increases up-section of the tuff sequence with two abrupt drops across the tuff unit boundaries. These variations are coincident with the changes in the chemical composition of juvenile particles, suggesting an overall decrease in magma flux punctuated by brief increases in magma flux associated with the arrival of new magma batches. The textural and compositional variations of the Songaksan tuff ring suggest that there can be significant variability in diatreme processes even during a purely phreatomagmatic eruption of a tuff ring, including removal and renewal of the diatreme fill, and that there is still much room for further investigation of the diatreme processes from the ejecta beds in order to make the current diatreme model more robust.

AB  - Near-natural stormwater infiltration can cause rising groundwater tables in urban areas. In order to assess these effects, the area-differentiated groundwater recharge in a real investigation area in Germany and their effects on the groundwater table are modelled using three different computer programs. The first program determines the natural area-differentiated groundwater recharge for the whole study area without considering the infiltration facilities. The second program is used to localise infiltration processes and it calculates the groundwater recharge below the infiltration facilities. The groundwater recharge rates calculated with these two programs are incorporated in the numerical groundwater model. It is used to simulate the groundwater surface level development. By varying the size of additional development areas, the degree of sealing, the infiltration rate and the precipitation different simulation scenarios were conducted. It was found that both the precipitation and the infiltration rate are the most influencing factors concerning the groundwater surface. Further, problems have to be expected especially in areas with low hydraulic conductivities. To ensure sustainable depths to groundwater table calculating the water budget can be recommended, as to name just one of the recommendations presented in this paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The cities of Rivera and Santana do Livramento are located on the outcropping area of the sandstone Guarani Aquifer on the Brazil-Uruguay border, where the aquifer is being increasingly exploited. Therefore, recharge estimates are needed to address sustainability. First, a conceptual model of the area was developed. A multilayer, heterogeneous and anisotropic groundwater-flow model was built to validate the conceptual model and to estimate recharge. A field campaign was conducted to collect water samples and monitor water levels used for model calibration. Field data revealed that there exists vertical gradients between confining basalts and underlying sandstones, suggesting basalts could indirectly recharge sandstone in fractured areas. Simulated downward flow between them was a small amount within the global water budget. Calibrated recharge rates over basalts and over outcropping sandstones were 1.3 and 8.1% of mean annual precipitation, respectively. A big portion of sandstone recharge would be drained by streams. The application of a water balance yielded a recharge of 8.5% of average annual precipitation. The numerical model and the water balance yielded similar recharge values consistent with determinations from previous authors in the area and other regions of the aquifer, providing an upper bound for recharge in this transboundary aquifer.

AB  - An investigation was conducted to assess the hydrogeochemical processes of an alluvial channel aquifer located in a typical Karoo Basin of Southern Africa. The investigation was aimed at identifying and describing the groundwater chemistry evolution and its contribution to the overall groundwater quality. X-ray fluorescent spectrometry (XRF) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analyses were performed on geological samples to identify and quantify the major element oxides and minerals. The study utilises the conventional Piper diagram, bivariate plots and PHREEQC hydrogeochemical model to analyse groundwater chemistry data obtained during the wet (February and May) and dry seasons (August and December) of 2011. The XRF and XRD results show that the channel deposits are dominated by SiO2 element oxides and quartz minerals, thus elevated concentrations of silicon (Si4+) were found in the groundwater. Dolomite and calcite minerals were also detected in the unconsolidated aquifer sediments. The detailed study of the alluvial aquifer system has shown that dissolution of dolomite and calcite minerals and ion exchange are the dominant hydrogeochemical processes influencing the groundwater quality. The groundwater evolves from Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3 (-) recharge water that goes through ion exchange with Na+ in the clay-silt sediment to give a Na+-HCO3 (-) water type. The groundwater is supersaturated with respect to quartz, dolomite and calcite minerals. The study shows the potential usefulness of simple bivariate plots as a complimentary tool to the conventional methods for analyzing groundwater hydrogeochemical processes.

AB  - Sustainable water management requires an understanding of the effects of flow regulation on riparian ecomorphological processes. We investigated the transient response of Salix viminalis by examining the effect of water-level regimes on its above-ground and below-ground biomass. Four sets of Salix cuttings, three juveniles (in the first growing season) and one mature (1 year old), were planted and initially grown under the same water-level regime for 1 month. We imposed three different water-level regime treatments representing natural variability, a seasonal trend with no peaks, and minimal flow (characteristic of hydropower) consisting of a constant water level and natural flood peaks. We measured sap flux, stem water potential, photosynthesis, growth parameters, and final root architecture. The mature cuttings were not affected by water table dynamics, but the juveniles displayed causal relationships between the changing water regime, plant growth, and root distribution during a 2 month transient period. For example, a 50% drop in mean sap flux corresponded with a -1.5 Mpa decrease in leaf water potential during the first day after the water regime was changed. In agreement with published field observations, the cuttings concentrated their roots close to the mean water table of the corresponding treatment, allowing survival under altered conditions and resilience to successive stress events. Juvenile development was strongly impacted by the minimum flow regime, leading to more than 60% reduction of both above-ground and below-ground biomass, with respect to the other treatments. Hence, we suggest avoiding minimum flow regimes where Salix restoration is prioritized.

AB  - We present a comparative analysis of projected impacts of climate change on river runoff from two types of distributed hydrological model, a global hydrological model (GHM) and catchment-scale hydrological models (CHM). Analyses are conducted for six catchments that are global in coverage and feature strong contrasts in spatial scale as well as climatic and developmental conditions. These include the Liard (Canada), Mekong (SE Asia), Okavango (SW Africa), Rio Grande (Brazil), Xiangxi (China) and Harper's Brook (UK). A single GHM (Mac-PDM. 09) is applied to all catchments whilst different CHMs are applied for each catchment. The CHMs include SLURP v. 12.2 (Liard), SLURP v. 12.7 (Mekong), Pitman (Okavango), MGB-IPH (Rio Grande), AV-SWAT-X 2005 (Xiangxi) and Cat-PDM (Harper's Brook). The CHMs typically simulate water resource impacts based on a more explicit representation of catchment water resources than that available from the GHM and the CHMs include river routing, whereas the GHM does not. Simulations of mean annual runoff, mean monthly runoff and high (Q5) and low (Q95) monthly runoff under baseline (1961-1990) and climate change scenarios are presented. We compare the simulated runoff response of each hydrological model to (1) prescribed increases in global-mean air temperature of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 degrees C relative to baseline from the UKMO HadCM3 Global Climate Model (GCM) to explore response to different amounts of climate forcing, and (2) a prescribed increase in global-mean air temperature of 2.0 degrees C relative to baseline for seven GCMs to explore response to climate model structural uncertainty. We find that the differences in projected changes of mean annual runoff between the two types of hydrological model can be substantial for a given GCM (e.g. an absolute GHM-CHM difference in mean annual runoff percentage change for UKMO HadCM3 2 degrees C warming of up to 25%), and they are generally larger for indicators of high and low monthly runoff. However, they are relatively small in comparison to the range of projections across the seven GCMs. Hence, for the six catchments and seven GCMs we considered, climate model structural uncertainty is greater than the uncertainty associated with the type of hydrological model applied. Moreover, shifts in the seasonal cycle of runoff with climate change are represented similarly by both hydrological models, although for some catchments the monthly timing of high and low flows differs. This implies that for studies that seek to quantify and assess the role of climate model uncertainty on catchment-scale runoff, it may be equally as feasible to apply a GHM (Mac-PDM. 09 here) as it is to apply a CHM, especially when climate modelling uncertainty across the range of available GCMs is as large as it currently is. Whilst the GHM is able to represent the broad climate change signal that is represented by the CHMs, we find however, that for some catchments there are differences between GHMs and CHMs in mean annual runoff due to differences in potential evapotranspiration estimation methods, in the representation of the seasonality of runoff, and in the magnitude of changes in extreme (Q5, Q95) monthly runoff, all of which have implications for future water management issues.

AB  - The present study has analyzed the variability in depth to water level below ground level (bgl) vis-a-vis groundwater development and rainfall from 1987 to 2007 in agriculture dominated Kaithal district of Haryana state in India. Spatial distribution of groundwater depth was mapped and classified into different zones using ILWIS 3.6 GIS tools. Change detection maps were prepared for 1987-1997 and 1997-2007. Groundwater depletion rates during successive decades were compared and critical areas with substantial fall in groundwater levels were identified. Further, block wise trends of change in groundwater levels were also analyzed. The water table in fresh belt areas of the district (Gulha, Pundri and Kaithal blocks) was observed to decline by a magnitude ranging from 10 m to 23 m. In Kalayat and Rajaund blocks, the levels were found fluctuating in a relatively narrow range of 4-9 m. During 1997-2007, the depletion has been faster compared to the preceding decade. Excessive groundwater depletion in major part of the district may be attributed to indiscriminate abstraction for irrigation and decrease in rainfall experienced since 1998. Changes in cropping pattern and irrigation methods are needed in the study area for sustainable management of the resource.

AB  - Water resources sustainability hinges on interrelated physical, chemical, biological, and human processes, all of which may affect the quantity and quality of available water supplies. California's decades-long transition process from intensive and often unmanaged groundwater development toward more effective, sustainable integrated water resources management has resulted in important lessons. The process offers insights to other countries that seek to achieve sustainability. Long-term systematic groundwater and surface water monitoring programs and ongoing assessment of regional groundwater systems are an integral part of management. On local to global scales, the need for fundamental data, regional resources assessments, and increased support for scientific and technological advances is becoming increasingly apparent. The scientific community must enhance society's understanding of the essential links between basic data needs and the advancement and application of scientific approaches for effective water management. Correspondingly, scientific and political communities must coordinate common interests in endeavors toward sustainable management. Public outreach is a necessary complement to achieve sustainability goals and garner support for the programs needed to develop water policies based on sound science, manage water resources, and meet future water demands while avoiding unacceptable impacts.

AB  - This study analyses the statistical and dynamic properties of time series of mean annual groundwater levels for the years 1961-2000, with the purpose of preparing reference statistics for the study period. Data came from 62 measurement stations of the groundwater observation network of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management-the National Research Institute IMGW-PIB-located across the Wielkopolska Lowland (western Poland). Station-grouping criteria were as follows: the availability of a 40-year measurement series, spatial location, as well as separation of the aquifer from the surface. For estimating the time series structure of groundwater levels, the following stationarity tests were conducted: the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test, with positive results in 44% of the stations, the majority comprising a group that represents confined aquifers. Their non-stationarity was attributed to the presence of a long-term stochastic trend. In the majority of cases the groundwater-level frequency distributions were within the group of platykurtic distributions, right asymmetrical. In the period studied, 62% of the series showed a downward tendency of groundwater levels, including 45% for which the trend was statistically significant; a rising trend was only statistically significant in half of the series. The masking effect of anthropogenic factors was indicated as a fundamental element interfering with the statistical properties of the groundwater observation series in the period 1961-2000 in the Wielkopolska Lowland. This information can be of use for the management and protection of water resources and in prognostic studies on modifying aquiferous systems with recorded water deficits.

AB  - Spatial complexity in metacommunities can be separated into 3 main components: size (i.e., number of habitat patches), spatial arrangement of habitat patches (network topology), and diversity of habitat patch types. Much attention has been paid to lattice-type networks, such as patch-based metapopulations, but interest in understanding ecological networks of alternative geometries is building. Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) include some increasingly threatened ecological systems, such as caves and streams. The restrictive architecture of dendritic ecological networks might have overriding implications for species persistence. I used a modeling approach to investigate how number and spatial arrangement of habitat patches influence metapopulation extinction risk in 2 DENs of different size and topology. Metapopulation persistence was higher in larger networks, but this relationship was mediated by network topology and the dispersal pathways used to navigate the network. Larger networks, especially those with greater topological complexity, generally had lower extinction risk than smaller and less-complex networks, but dispersal bias and magnitude affected the shape of this relationship. Applying these general results to real systems will require empirical data on the movement behavior of organisms and will improve our understanding of the implications of network complexity on population and community patterns and processes.

AB  - 1. Stream ecosystems exhibit a highly consistent dendritic geometry in which linear habitat units intersect to create a hierarchical network of connected branches. 2. Ecological and life history traits of species living in streams, such as the potential for overland movement, may interact with this architecture to shape patterns of occupancy and response to disturbance. Specifically, large-scale habitat alteration that fragments stream networks and reduces connectivity may reduce the probability a stream is occupied by sensitive species, such as stream salamanders. 3. We collected habitat occupancy data on four species of stream salamanders in first-order (i.e. headwater) streams in undeveloped and urbanised regions of the eastern U.S.A. We then used an information-theoretic approach to test alternative models of salamander occupancy based on a priori predictions of the effects of network configuration, region and salamander life history. 4. Across all four species, we found that streams connected to other first-order streams had higher occupancy than those flowing directly into larger streams and rivers. For three of the four species, occupancy was lower in the urbanised region than in the undeveloped region. 5. These results demonstrate that the spatial configuration of stream networks within protected areas affects the occurrences of stream salamander species. We strongly encourage preservation of network connections between first-order streams in conservation planning and management decisions that may affect stream species.

AB  - Stream ecosystems are particularly sensitive to urbanization, and tolerance of water-quality parameters is likely important to population persistence of stream salamanders. Forecasted climate and landscape changes may lead to significant changes in stream flow, chemical composition, and temperatures in coming decades. Protected areas where landscape alterations are minimized will therefore become increasingly important for salamander populations. We surveyed 29 streams at three national parks in the highly urbanized greater metropolitan area of Washington, DC. We investigated relationships among water-quality variables and occupancy of three species of stream salamanders (Desmognathus fuscus, Eurycea bislineata, and Pseudotriton ruber). With the use of a set of site-occupancy models, and accounting for imperfect detection, we found that stream-water temperature limits salamander occupancy. There was substantial uncertainty about the effects of the other water-quality variables, although both specific conductance (SC) and pH were included in competitive models. Our estimates of occupancy suggest that temperature, SC, and pH have some importance in structuring stream salamander distribution.

AB  - Tourism accounts for 15% of Greece's gross domestic product. In the wake of a struggling economy many of Greece's coastal villages have turned to tourism to supplement local economies. Preliminary analysis of structural and cultural materials recovered from an excavation on Mitrou, a small islet near the coastal village Tragana located 140 kin north of Athens has established the site's contribution to a fuller understanding of settlement practices in Central Greece from the end of the Bronze Age through the Early Iron Age. The site's historic importance combined with its scenic coastal setting has considerable potential to be developed into an important tourist site. The physical geography of the region is the product of the complex interaction of coastal, alluvial, fluvial, and seismic processes. This investigation integrates the archaeological material with a geographical analysis employing a variety of geographical techniques (soil and sediment analysis, past climatic data, environmental surveys, and geospatial modeling) to reconstruct the geomorphological history of the site and to evaluate the area as a potential tourist site.

AB  - The Swakop River is a major ephemeral river (drainage basin area about 30,000 km(2)) crossing the western Namib Desert. Its hydrology and limited water resources depend on storms and floods. Therefore, the hydrology and flow regime in the Swakop River basin determines the availability of water for human use. In this study we present a millennia-long record of extreme floods, using paleoflood hydrological methods and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages. The record includes 44 large floods ranging in date from the late Pleistocene to the present. The oldest six to eight floods are dated from the late Pleistocene to the mid-Holocene (between 14,900 +/- 1700 and 5100 +/- 620 years ago), with calculated peak discharges of 550-1280 m(3) s(-1). Eighteen floods, eleven of which were between 1000 and 1600 m(3) s(-1), occurred between 740 +/- 90 and 190 +/- 10 years ago. Additional 17 later floods occurred between about AD 1850 and 1963, with peak discharges between 100 and 1000 m(3) s(-1). The historical record which partly parallels the latter period recorded 17 large floods during the period 1893-1963. Flood frequency analysis (FFA) of the combined systematically gaged record (1963-2003) and the paleoflood record since AD 1270 (740 +/- 90 years, the most complete record), was applied using the maximum likelihood method. A two-component extreme value distribution (TCEV) estimates the 1% annual exceedance probability magnitude, using only the systematic gaged record at 520 m(3) s(-1). The combined paleoflood, historical, and gage records resulted in a much larger magnitudes for the 1% annual exceedance probability flood magnitude of 1320-1350 m(3) s(-1). The 0.1% annual exceedance probability magnitude is estimated at 770 m(3) s(-1) and 2100-2150 m(3) s(-1), respectively. The hydroclimatic interpretation of this paleoflood record is complex, due to the discontinuity of the record. During the late Holocene, our flood data show three intervals differing in their flood regime: (1) 1280 +/- 80 to 740 +/- 90 years BP, with one extraordinary flood (>200 m(3) s(-1)) about every 180 years; (2) 740 +/- 90 to 200 +/- 45 C-14 years BP, with one large flood per 80 years; and (3) 200 +/- 45 C-14 years BP to AD1963, with one large flood per 7 years. Interval 2 represents large floods, probably related to the transition from a drier climate to the colder and probably wetter climate of the Little Ice Age (LIA). The third period relates to the end of the LIA and to a wetter period of the 19th and early 20th centuries in which more rainfall in the Kalahari and Namib Deserts and many historical floods were documented. The presence of three distinct calcretes rich in calcified rhizoliths at one of the sites, two of which were dated by OSL to 13.2 +/- 1.9 ka and 8.8 +/- 1.0 ka, indicates, at least locally, higher moisture availability than in the current semiarid climate; the presence of denser vegetation can be associated with increased groundwater seepage and wetter climatic conditions.

AB  - In response to increasing use of the subsurface, there is a need to modernise policies on sustainable use of the subsurface. This holds in particular for the densely populated Netherlands. We aimed to analyse current practice of subsurface management and the associated pressure points and to establish a conceptual overview of the technical issues related to sustainable management of the subsurface. Case studies on the exploitation of subsurface resources (including spatial use of the subsurface) were analysed, examining social relevance, environmental impact, pressure points and management solutions. The case studies ranged from constructing underground garages to geothermal exploitation. The following issues were identified for the technological/scientific aspects: site investigation, suitability, risk assessment, monitoring and measures in the event of failure. Additionally, the following general issues were identified for the administrative aspects: spatial planning, option assessment, precaution, transparency, responsibility and liability. These issues were explored on their technological implications within the framework of sustainable management of the subsurface. This resulted into the following key aspects: (1) sustainability assessment, (2) dealing with uncertainty and (3) policy instruments and governance. For all three aspects, different options were identified which might have a legal, economic or ethical background. The technological implications of these backgrounds have been identified. A set of recommendations for sustainable management of the subsurface resources (id. space) was established: (1) management should be driven by scarcity, (2) always implement closed loop monitoring when the subsurface activities are high-risk, (3) when dealing with unknown features and heterogeneity, apply the precautionary principle, (4) responsibility and liability for damage must be set out in legislation and (5) sustainability should be incorporated in all relevant legislation and not only in environmental legislation. Other aspects to be considered are the reversibility of the impacts from subsurface activities and the abandonment of installations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estimates of groundwater volumes available in semiarid regions that rely on water balance calculations require the determination of both surface to groundwater lag times and volumes from irrigation or rainfall initiated recharge. Subsurface geologic material hydraulic properties (e. g. hydraulic conductivities, water retention functions) necessary for unsaturated flow modelling are rarely available as are the instrumented field tests that might determine such lag times. Here we develop a simple two-parameter (specific yield, S-y, and pore-size distribution index, lambda), one-dimensional unsaturated flow model from simplifications of the Richards equation (using the Brooks-Corey relationships) to determine lag times from agricultural deep drainage associated with the irrigation of alfalfa hay and various row crops in the Antelope Valley of California, USA. Model-predicted lag times to depths of 85m bgs (below ground surface) were similar to that measured in a 2-year ponded recharge field trial, slightly overestimating that measured by approximately 15% (0.51 vs 0.44 years). Lag time estimates were most sensitive to estimated deep percolation rates and roughly equally sensitive to the model hydraulic parameters. Generally, as subsurface material textures coarsen towards larger S-y and lambda values for all S-y > 10%, lag times progressively increase; however, at S-y < 10%, lag times decrease substantially suggesting that particular combinations of S-y and lambda values that may be associated with similarly textured materials can result in the prediction of different lag times for S-y approximately 10%. Overall, lag times of 1-3 years to a depth of 69 m bgs were estimated from deep drainage of agricultural irrigation across a variety of irrigation schedules and subsurface materials.

AB  - Water resources are important to land-use planning, especially in regions where converting native oak woodlands or savannas to wine grape vineyards may affect the amount of water available for restoring salmon runs. Research has shown that woodland conversion to grasslands (for possible rangeland grazing) leads to greater and more sustained stream flow and groundwater recharge; however, little information is available about woodland conversion to vineyards. To inform resource managers and planners, we developed a water balance model for soil and applied it to vineyards, native oak woodlands and annual grasslands to evaluate their relative use of groundwater. We applied the model to Sonoma County, using climate data from 1999 to 2011, and determined that oak tree canopy coverage of 40% to 60% results in annual groundwater extraction equivalent to that of an established irrigated vineyard. However, vineyard groundwater use far exceeded that of oak woodlands in late summer to early fall, which could further stress already affected groundwater resources. We also evaluated the prediction sensitivity of the model to key parameters associated with rain levels, soil water-holding capacity and irrigation management.

AB  - The largest Kuiseb River floods initiate at the basin's semi-arid headwater. Downstream, along the hyperarid Namib Desert, these floodwaters are feeding shallow alluvial aquifers, the only available water for human activity and for the natural ecology. Here, we characterize the largest floods and their changing frequency and magnitudes using palaeohydrological methods. Along 120km of the rivers canyon 35 palaeoflood deposit sites were identified. At five of these sites we conducted stratigraphic and geochronological analyses and flood discharge estimations. The upper bound of the largest flood over the late Holocene is approximate to 1475 m3 s1. Over the last 1300 years more than ten floods have exceeded 1250 m3 s1. An additional 33 floods exceeded 400 m3 s1. The last millennium was characterized by one large flood every 3040 years during the periods 12501335, 13551565 and 1715 AD to the present. A slight increase in flood frequency (not magnitude) occurred during 15651715 AD (one large flood in approximate to 20 years) and during two short episodes, 11851205 and 13351355 AD (seven and four floods in 20 years, respectively). These episodes of increased flood frequency are associated with other proxy records of higher water availability in the Namib. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Polymerase II (Pol II) transcriptional termination depends on two independent genetic elements: poly(A) signals and downstream terminator sequences. The latter may either promote cotranscriptional RNA cleavage or pause elongating Pol II. We demonstrate that the previously characterized MAZ(4) pause element promotes Pol II termination downstream of a poly(A) signal, dependent on both the proximity of the pause site and poly(A) signal and the strength of the poly(A) signal. The 5'-> 3' exonuclease Xrn2 facilitates this pause-dependent termination by degrading the 3' product of poly(A) site cleavage. The human beta-actin gene also possesses poly(A) site proximal pause sequences, which like MAZ(4) are G rich and promote transcriptional termination. Xrn2 depletion causes an increase in both steady-state RNA and Pol II levels downstream of the beta-actin poly(A) site. Taken together, we provide new insights into the mechanism of pause site-mediated termination and establish a general role for the 5'-> 3' exonuclease Xrn2 in Pol II termination.

AB  - Water insecurity is a growing concern globally, especially for developing countries, where a range of factors including urbanization are putting pressure on water provisioning systems. The role of groundwater and aquifers in buffering the effects of climate variability is increasingly acknowledged, but it can only be fully realized with a more robust understanding of groundwater as a resource, and how use of it and dependency on it differ. Accra and its hinterland exemplify an African city with chronic water shortages, where groundwater resources offer opportunities to improve resilience against recurring droughts and general water insecurity. Based on a mixed-methods study of a peri-urban township, it was found that for end users, particularly poor urban households, resilience is an every-day matter of ensuring access from different sources, for different purposes, while attention to drinking water safety is falling behind. Planners and decision makers should take their cue from how households have developed coping mechanisms by diversifying, and move away from the focus on large infrastructure and centralized water supply solutions. Conjunctive use, managed aquifer recharge, and suitable treatment measures are vital to make groundwater a strategic resource on the urban agenda.

AB  - Climate change may impact water resources management conditions in difficult-to-predict ways. A key challenge for water managers is how to incorporate highly uncertain information about potential climate change from global models into local- and regional-scale water management models and tools to support local planning. This paper presents a new method for developing large ensembles of local daily weather that reflect a wide range of plausible future climate change scenarios while preserving many statistical properties of local historical weather patterns. This method is demonstrated by evaluating the possible impact of climate change on the Inland Empire Utilities Agency service area in southern California. The analysis shows that climate change could impact the region, increasing outdoor water demand by up to 10% by 2040, decreasing local water supply by up to 40% by 2040, and decreasing sustainable groundwater yields by up to 15% by 2040. The range of plausible climate projections suggests the need for the region to augment its long-range water management plans to reduce its vulnerability to climate change.

AB  - Groundwater in shallow weathered and fractured crystalline rock aquifers is often the only perennial water resource, especially in semi-arid region such as Southern India. Understanding groundwater flows in such a context is of prime importance for sustainable aquifer management. Here, we describe a detailed study of fracture properties and relate the hydraulic connectivity of fractures to groundwater flows at local and watershed scales. Investigations were carried out at a dedicated Experimental Hydro-geological Park in Andhra Pradesh (Southern India) where a large network of observation boreholes has been set up. Twenty-height boreholes have been drilled in a small area of about 18,000 m(2) in which borehole loggings and hydraulic tests were carried out to locate the main flowing fractured zones and investigate fractures connectivity. Several hydraulic tests (nineteen slug tests and three pumping tests) performed under two water level conditions revealed contrasting behavior. Under high water level conditions, the interface including the bottom of the saprolite and the first flowing fractured zone in the upper part of the granite controls groundwater flows at the watershed-scale. Under low water level conditions, the aquifer is characterized by lateral compartmentalization due to a decrease in the number of flowing fractures with depth. Depending on the water level conditions, the aquifer shifts from a watershed flow system to independent local flow systems. A conceptual groundwater flow model, which includes depth-dependent fracture connectivity, is proposed to illustrate this contrasting hydrological behavior. Implications for watershed hydrology, groundwater chemistry and aquifer vulnerability are also discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - When comparing environmental management alternatives, there is a need to assess the effect of uncertainty in the underlying model(s) and future conditions on robustness of recommendations. At times, it may be difficult or undesirable to specify the uncertainty in inputs and parameters a priori. An alternative approach instead generates crossover points, describing scenarios where the preferred alternative will change (i.e. alternatives are of equal value), and prompts the analyst to assess their plausibility a posteriori. This paper extends previous work by introducing principles, design and implementation of a new method to analyse crossover points. It reduces the complexity of dealing with many variables by identifying single crossover points of greatest concern, and progressively building understanding through three stages of analysis. We present three implementations using R, Excel and a web interface. They use two examples involving cost-benefit analysis of managed aquifer recharge and the water footprint impact of changing diets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Droughts may be caused by both natural and anthropogenic factors and delimitation of them is crucial for identification of exposed areas. This study concentrated on the application of the threshold level method combined with GIS modelling applied to hydrogeological drought characterization. The first step was to define groundwater drought periods and analysis of drought intensity and duration based on long-term monitoring data from points evenly spaced within the study area. Then the distribution of hydrogeological drought intensity was identified combining a geostatistical kriging method with the type of geographical region. Utilizing GIS modelling with integration of several parameters the final map was created showing vulnerability and exposure of the area to hydrogeological drought. Studies indicate that the area most exposed to drought is located in the north eastern part of Lower Silesia being influenced by water abstraction and mining activity as well as drought.

AB  - The assessment of the impact of long-term climate variability on water supply systems depends not only on possible variations of the resources availability, but also on the variation of the demand. In this framework, a robust estimation of direct (climate induced) and indirect (anthropogenically induced) effects of climate change ismandatory to design mitigation measures, especially in those regions of the planet where the ground water equilibrium is strongly perturbed by exploitations for irrigation purposes. The main goal of this contribution is to propose a comprehensive model that integrates distributed crop water requirements with surface and ground water mass balance, able to consider management rules of the water supply system. The proposed overall model, implemented, calibrated and validated for the case study of the Fortore water supply system (Apulia region, South Italy), permits to simulate the conjunctive use of the water from a surface artificial reservoir and from groundwater. The relative contributions of groundwater recharges and withdrawals to the aquifer stress have been evaluated under different climate perturbations, with emphasis on irrigation practices. Results point out that irrigated agriculture primarily affects groundwater discharge, indicating that ecosystem services connected to river base flow are particularly exposed to climate variation in irrigated areas. Moreover, findings show that the recharge both to surface and to groundwater is mainly affected by drier climate conditions, while hotter conditions have a major impact on the water demand. The non-linearity arising from combined drier and hotter conditions may exacerbate the aquifer stress by exposing it to massive sea-water intrusion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) is a region of utmost importance to Vietnam's national food security. However, the availability of required freshwater resources (from both surface and groundwater sources) is currently under great threats due to dry season salinity intrusion, surface water pollution, and over-exploitation of groundwater. Global climate change, sea level rise, and upstream and in situ development activities may worsen the situation. Assuming that adaptive management could be a promising strategy to address the increasingly complex and unpredictable water-related problems in the VMD, we design and apply a framework to identify the extent to which the governance regime in this region exhibits conditions that are likely to promote adaptive freshwater management. Using both primary and secondary data, our analysis reveals that the prospects for adaptive water management in the study area are limited since several conditions were not present. We observe among others limitations in vertical and horizontal integration and public participation, restraints in knowledge and information sharing, inadequate policy development and implementation, and insufficient diversification of financial resources. Following our findings, we conclude the paper with recommendations both for national, regional and local policy interventions and for future research. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The repetition of droughts in France has led to a growing demand for irrigation water and consequently to an increase in requests for the construction of small farm dams. Although such dams are small, their accumulation in a basin affects river flows, because the water collected in these small farm dams is used for irrigation and thus does not contribute to river flow. In order to gain more insight into their impact on the annual and monthly discharges, especially during dry years, a small farm dam model was built and connected to a hydrometeorological model. Several scenarios with different volume capacities, filling catchment sizes and filling periods were tested for such dams. The results were analysed in a small basin in western France, where the pressure for building such dams is high, and then extended to the entire country. It was found that, due to the hydrometeorological conditions (mainly low precipitation compared to other regions in France), the development of small farm dams in north-western France would result in greater decreases in river flows and less efficient filling of small farm dams than in other regions. Therefore, such dams might not be as efficient as expected in supplying water to farmers when needed. Moreover, the ability to fill small farm dams is projected to decrease in a context of climate change, despite the uncertainty on the evolution of precipitation, thus worsening the situation.

AB  - The study area extends along northwestern Sinai coastal plain, which is considered an integral part of the Mediterranean Sea. It depends mainly on the groundwater resource for different type of human activities such as agricultural and drinking. Many programs and policies should be implemented in this area to concurrently improve the sustainability of groundwater use and manage the risks of its degradation. Leakage from some factories in Bir El-Abd might be a contamination source that would threaten groundwater. In this paper, an attempt was made using an integrated approach of the hydrogeological setting and the conjugation of the hydrogeochemical data with the stable isotope hydrology for representation of the conceptual model of the study area. Those tools give more insights on the characterization of the groundwater system with all relevant boundaries and main recharge sources of the aquifer; which is considered to be the key components of a groundwater modeling. A particular focus is placed on modeling a hypothetical accident for contaminant transport in the groundwater system, using both lead and chromium as a typical contaminant component. Further predication of the concentration of those elements has been estimated, and the safety distances of their plume have been determined. This study would be helpful in dealing with water management issues related to contaminant hydrogeology. As well, it introduces some finding for reducing the environmental risk form the industrial development at the study area.

AB  - Groundwater table fluctuations (WTF), chloride mass balance (CMB), apparent groundwater chlorofluorocarbon (CFC-12) ages and tritium (H-3) mean residence times were used to assess recharge rates on Jeju Island (Korea), where groundwater is the main source of potable water. Given the limitations of various techniques and the respective data, the methods yield median values of 687 mm/yr (WTF), 429 mm/yr (CMB), 423 mm/yr (CFC-12) and 394 mm/yr (H-3), which are lower than the multi-annual (1993-2002) average value calculated using the soil water budget (SWB) method (911 mm/yr). These underestimates are mainly due to most groundwater samples used for the analyses being located in the more arid low-land areas of the island. All methods yield highest recharge rates in the southern and eastern districts of Jeju implying a strong control of rainfall on the spatial recharge distribution. The spatial variability of recharge at the catchment scale is caused by spatially and temporally variable rainfall and evapotranspiration as well as the wide range in effective porosity and specific yield values of the aquifer lithologies. The WTF method yields reliable results in the coastal regions where low hydraulic gradients prevail. The CMB technique underestimates the recharge values of the SWB in all geographic districts probably as a result of anthropogenic Cl additions to groundwater and unaccounted for atmospheric Cl dry deposition. Median recharge estimates from the CFC-12 and H-3 data show the lowest spatial correlation with those from the SWB mainly as a result of vertical anisotropies and uncertainties in the determination of effective aquifer thicknesses particularly in the perched, high level areas. The here applied methods are useful for local calibration and validation of SWB estimates in lower parabasal regions where thin unsaturated zones prevail; however, due to their inability to predict recharge in the more remote upslope areas from which, as of yet, no groundwater data could be obtained, they cannot be applied to predict average recharge values representative for the whole island.

AB  - This note presents a numerical model and investigation of one-dimensional large strain consolidation-induced land subsidence due to groundwater pumping. The model, called CLS1, employs the CS2 methodology and is applicable for settlement of a compressible soil layer due to a reduction in boundary pore pressure under constant overburden stress. Verification checks show excellent agreement with analytical solutions for local degree of consolidation through time. Several numeric examples are presented to highlight capabilities of the new model and emphasize the effect of soil constitutive relationships, soil self-weight, and variable groundwater pumping on consolidation-induced land subsidence. The examples indicate that failure to account for these aspects can yield significant errors in predictions of settlement through time.

AB  - In many countries, farmers are turning to groundwater to make up for surface water scarcity and to deal with increasing water demand. even inside large-scale irrigation schemes. In many situations, this leads to the mining of groundwater resources, which in turn threatens the sustainability of the farms that depend on this resource. The purpose of this study was to find ways to provide the necessary information to stakeholders to enable them to construct rules for sustainable groundwater management. The dynamics of water resources and water use practices were analysed and management indicators were designed for two irrigation schemes in North Africa: Tadla (Morocco) and Mitidja West (Algeria). The results showed, firstly, that available groundwater has decreased; secondly, that farming systems depend to an increasing extent on groundwater resources, and thirdly, that individual and collective access to groundwater depends on informal arrangements. We developed and tested a platform for dialogue for water management focused on exploring plausible scenarios of agricultural development in relation to the use of groundwater.

AB  - The impacts of anthropogenic modifications to the landscape on groundwater recharge rates, locations, and mechanisms are reviewed. The two major categories of change examined are conversion of land for agriculture and urbanization, both of which have significant effects on groundwater recharge. Techniques for identifying and quantifying the changes in recharge due to these impacts are discussed. Land-clearing for agriculture and surface water transfer for irrigation have resulted in order of magnitude increases in recharge rates in many semi-arid regions worldwide, causing ongoing land and water salinization and water-logging problems. While increased recharge by irrigation return flow may alleviate shallow groundwater depletion in some settings, this is complicated by the effect of unsaturated zone thickening, which reduces the fraction of potential recharge becoming actual recharge, and may result in new water quality risks such as nitrate contamination. Expansion of urban and peri-urban land and their associated surface and sub-surface infrastructure results in complex water balance changes that re-distribute groundwater recharge locations, modify recharge mechanism(s) and result in variable impacts on recharge rates (e.g., overall net decrease, increase or minimal change) and quality. While changes to groundwater recharge resulting from conversion of land for agriculture are relatively well understood, less is documented about the changes resulting from urbanization, due to a paucity of data from field-based studies. Two case studies from Beijing, China and Melbourne Australia are examined, which highlight these impacts and demonstrate some potential methodological techniques for this topic.

AB  - This paper presents a historical analysis from socio-hydrological perspectives of the coupled humangroundwater system of the Cangzhou region in the North China Plain (NCP). The history of the "pendulum swing" for water allocation between the economic development and aquifer environmental health of the system is divided into five eras (i.e., natural, exploitation, degradation and restoration, drought-triggered deterioration, and returning to equilibrium). The system's evolution was interpreted using the Taiji-Tire model. Over-exploitation was considered as the main cause of aquifer depletion, and the groundwater utilization pattern was affected by the varying groundwater table. The aquifer depletion enhanced community sensitivity toward environmental issues, and upgraded the social productive force for restoration. The evolution of the system was substantially impacted by two droughts. The drought in 1965 induced the system from natural conditions to groundwater exploiting. The drought from 1997 to 2002 resulted in a surge in further groundwater abstraction and dramatic aquifer deterioration, and community sensitivity increased rapidly and induced the social productive force to a tipping point. From then on, the system returns to equilibrium through new policies and water-saving technologies. Along with the establishment of a strict water resource management strategy and the launch of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, further restoration of groundwater environment was implemented. However, a comprehensive and coordinated drought management plan should be devised to avoid irreversible change in the system.

AB  - The concept of virtual water, which is the volume of water consumption required to produce commodities traded to an importing or exporting nation (or any region, company, individual, etc.), is a useful complement to water resource analyses of water availability and use by region. Identifying the source of virtual water, such as precipitation (green water) and irrigation water (blue water), further enhances this concept because each differs in the level of sustainability and opportunity cost. Recent improvements in global hydrological models consisting of both physically based hydrological and anthropogenic activity modules enabled us to simulate the virtual water content of major crops consistent with their global hydrological simulation. Enhancing one of these models, called H08. we were able to assess two major sources of virtual water flow or content simultaneously: green water and blue water. Blue water was further subdivided into three subcategories (i.e., streamflow, medium-size reservoirs, and nonrenewable and nonlocal blue water). We conducted a global hydrological simulation for 15 years from 1985 to 1999 at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees (longitude and latitude). Total precipitation on land was 113,900 km(3) yr(-1), with 72,080 km(3) yr(-1) on average evaporating in the period 1985-1999. Green water evapotranspiration from rainfed and irrigated cropland and blue water evapotranspiration from irrigated cropland was estimated at 7820, 1720, and 1530 km(3) yr(-1), respectively. Next, using global trade data for 2000 and the simulated virtual water content of major crops, the virtual water flow was estimated globally. Our results indicated that the global virtual water export (i.e., the volume of water that an exporting nation consumes to produce the commodities that it trades abroad) of five crops (barley, maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) and three livestock products (beef, pork, and chicken) is 545 km(3) yr(-1). Of the total virtual water exports, 61 km(3) yr(-1) (11%) are blue water (i.e., irrigation water) and 26 km(3) yr(-1) (5%) are nonrenewable and nonlocal blue water. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Humans abstract water from various sources to sustain their livelihood and society. Some global hydrological models (GHMs) include explicit schemes of human water abstraction, but the representation and performance of these schemes remain limited. We substantially enhanced the water abstraction schemes of the H08 GHM. This enabled us to estimate water abstraction from six major water sources, namely, river flow regulated by global reservoirs (i.e., reservoirs regulating the flow of the world's major rivers), aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, seawater desalination, renewable groundwater, and nonrenewable groundwater. In its standard setup, the model covers the whole globe at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, and the calculation interval is 1 day. All the interactions were simulated in a single computer program, and all water fluxes and storage were strictly traceable at any place and time during the simulation period. A global hydrological simulation was conducted to validate the performance of the model for the period of 1979-2013 (land use was fixed for the year 2000). The simulated water fluxes for water abstraction were validated against those reported in earlier publications and showed a reasonable agreement at the global and country level. The simulated monthly river discharge and terrestrial water storage (TWS) for six of the world's most significantly human-affected river basins were compared with gauge observations and the data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. It is found that the simulation including the newly added schemes outperformed the simulation without human activities. The simulated results indicated that, in 2000, of the 3628 +/- 75 km(3) yr(-1) global freshwater requirement, 2839 +/- 50 km(3) yr(-1) was taken from surface water and 789 +/- 30 km(3) yr(-1) from groundwater. Streamflow, aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, and seawater desalination accounted for 1786 +/- 23, 199 +/- 10, 106 +/- 5, and 1.8 +/- 0 km(3) yr(-1) of the surface water, respectively. The remaining 747 +/- 45 km(3) yr(-1) freshwater requirement was unmet, or surface water was not available when and where it was needed in our simulation. Renewable and nonrenewable groundwater accounted for 607 +/- 11 and 182 +/- 26 km(3) yr(-1) of the groundwater total, respectively. Each source differed in its renewability, economic costs for development, and environmental consequences of usage. The model is useful for performing global water resource assessments by considering the aspects of sustainability, economy, and environment.

AB  - Sustainable groundwater development must rely on a good understanding of hydrological processes, especially under effects of anthropogenic activities. This paper develops a piecewise analysis based on grey system model for study effects of anthropogenic activities on hydrological processes. The time series of precipitation and spring discharge were segmented into three time periods depending on whether variations are due to climate variation: the predevelopment stage, the transition stage, and the new equilibrium stage. Then we modeled hydrological process of the predevelopment stage and new equilibrium stage by the grey system model. By comparing the model results, we can quantify the effects of human activities on hydrological processes. We applied the model to Liulin Springs China. The results indicated that the hydraulic response time of the spring discharge to precipitation from the predevelopment stage to the new equilibrium stage, ranges from less than 1 year to up to 4 years. The results revealed that human activities slow the groundwater flow. GM (1,N) models of Liulin Springs discharge showed that the driving coefficients of precipitation to the spring discharge decreased from 0.012272 in the predevelopment stage to 0.007753 in the new equilibrium stage, which means that groundwater recharge ability has reduced about 36.82 %. Human activities in Liulin Springs have drastically changed the groundwater system. Piecewise grey system model is a robust method for hydrological process simulation.

AB  - The karst hydrological processes are the response of karst groundwater system to precipitation. The precipitation penetrates through the vadose zone, the subsequent groundwater pressure wave propagates to a spring outlet, and then, the spring discharge changes. This paper proposes a grey auto-incidence analysis for studying the karst hydrological processes. The method can detect the periodicity of a time series, for example, precipitation and spring discharge. Then the approach is applied to Liulin Springs Basin, China. The results show that the auto-incidence degree of precipitation reaches to the maximum (i.e., 0.816) when time delay equals to 8 years. The auto-incidence degree of spring discharge reaches to the maximum (i.e., 0.865) when time delay equals to 3 years. These results show that the periodicity of precipitation is 8 years, and of spring discharge is 3 years. The difference of periodicity between the precipitation and the spring discharge reveals that the processes of precipitation recharging groundwater and groundwater transport are regulated or controlled by karst aquifer. Because of heterogeneity of karst aquifer, the quick flow and base flow occur during the groundwater propagation, which causes the periodicity of spring discharge is not coincidence with of precipitation.

AB  - Hard-rock acid headwater catchments typically exhibit a rapid streamflow response and concomitant rapid mobilisation of soil-derived solutes, such as aluminium, into the aquatic environment during storm events. The rapid stream responses are paradoxically associated with pre-event water dominating the storm hydrograph, however the sources and mechanisms by which 'old' water enters the stream channel and interacts with the soil horizons are stilt poorly understood. To investigate these processes a detailed and novel field study was established in the riparian zone and lower hillstopes of the Hafren catchment at Plynlimon, mid-Wales. This study showed that shallow bedrock groundwaters; discharge into the stream channel. Pressure wave propagation in response to recharge further upslope caused a rapid displacement of shallow groundwaters up into the soils in the near-stream hiltstope. A lateral fast flow horizon transported water down slope as interflow at the soil-bedrock interface such that the upper soil horizons remained largely unsaturated. Only where there was a discontinuity in the lateral fast flow horizon was water forced up as an ephemeral spring discharge at the soil surface. At this site, the major zone of soil water-groundwater coupling was in a narrow (20-25 m) strip next to the stream channel. The zone of soil water-groundwater interaction next to the stream channel is likely to depend on the nature of the lateral flow pathways and the hiltstope characteristic. This study has shown the importance of the near-stream environment as a locus for soil waters that are bedrock groundwater derived; these groundwaters; dominate processes in the deepest soil horizons from where soil components such as aluminium are sourced. Understanding these physical processes is fundamental for understanding upland catchment functioning and has important implications for solute transport modelling and for the sustainable management of surface water systems and stream ecology in these headwater regions.

AB  - Recent studies identified the Mediterranean as a region particularly vulnerable to climate change. Since a large fraction of the region's water originates from karst aquifers, information about their future water availability is important for sustainable water management. This study presents an ensemble of 50 model chains considering five different realisations of the A1B ECHAM5 and HadCM3 climate projections, two different averaging methods to transfer the climate variables to the system scale and five different hydrological models that represent reasonable conceptualizations of the karst system. The ensemble is applied to Faria spring, a large Eastern Mediterranean karst spring in the West Bank. We show that for the near future (2021-2051) variability resulting from the different climate change projections and five different models is too large to draw conclusions on any significant change. In the remote future (2068-2098), variability decreases and our simulations suggest a decrease of water availability of -15% to -30%. We also assess the impact of recent pumping activities by running our hydrological models with recently measured data. There is a strong indication that the spring, which dried out in 2007, would have still yielded significant amounts of water if groundwater extractions had been limited. This calls for a better management of groundwater abstractions to meet future water needs in this drought-prone Mediterranean region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Karst aquifers provide large parts of the water supply for Mediterranean countries, though climate change is expected to have a significant negative impact on water availability. Recharge is therefore a key variable that has to be known for sustainable groundwater use. In this study, we present a new approach that combines two independent methods for karst recharge estimation. The first method derives spatially distributed information of mean annual recharge patterns through GIS analysis. The second is a process-based karst model that provides spatially lumped but temporally distributed information about recharge. By combining both methods, we add a spatial reference to the lumped simulations of the process-based model. In this way, we are able to provide spatiotemporal information of recharge and subsurface flow dynamics also during varying hydroclimatic conditions. We find that there is a nonlinear relationship between precipitation and recharge rates resulting in strong decreases of recharge following even moderate decreases of precipitation. This is primarily due to almost constant actual evapotranspiration amounts despite varying hydroclimatic conditions. During the driest year in the record, almost the entire precipitation was consumed as actual evapotranspiration and only little diffuse recharge took place at the high altitudes of our study site. During wettest year, recharge constituted a much larger fraction of precipitation and occurred at the entire study site. Our new method and our findings are significant for decision makers in similar regions that want to prepare for possible changes of hydroclimatic conditions in the future.

AB  - The green revolution in the northwest region of Bangladesh over the past three decades has based on groundwater irrigation. For sustainable agricultural accretion, groundwater dynamics play a vital role in this region. In this study, the groundwater level dynamics have been analyzed with a model named " MAKESENS" and with geographical information systems (GIS). The study indicates that, in most of the wells, the water table (WT) depth and the rainfall intensity are declining slowly. The prediction of WT depth during the period of 2020, 2040, and 2060 indicate that, in some cases, the WT depth will approximately double by the year 2060, considering the present declining trend. This result suggests that, for the sustainable management of groundwater, necessary measures should be adopted to avoid or reduce the severe ecological, social, and economic impacts of groundwater mining. Moreover, crop diversification, conservation techniques, increasing irrigation efficiency, rainwater harvesting, etc. can be adopted to avoid groundwater declination and consequently to enhance the sustainable use of groundwater resources in the area.

AB  - We present a method for determining streambed seepage rates using time series thermal data. The new method is based on quantifying changes in phase and amplitude of temperature variations between pairs of subsurface sensors. For a reasonable range of streambed thermal properties and sensor spacings the time series method should allow reliable estimation of seepage rates for a range of at least +/- 10 m d(-1) (+/- 1.2 x 10(-2) m s(-1)), with amplitude variations being most sensitive at low flow rates and phase variations retaining sensitivity out to much higher rates. Compared to forward modeling, the new method requires less observational data and less setup and data handling and is faster, particularly when interpreting many long data sets. The time series method is insensitive to streambed scour and sedimentation, which allows for application under a wide range of flow conditions and allows time series estimation of variable streambed hydraulic conductivity. This new approach should facilitate wider use of thermal methods and improve understanding of the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions.

AB  - Groundwater recharge sets a constraint on aquifer water balance in the context of water management. Historical data on groundwater and other relevant hydrological processes can be used to understand the effects of climatic variability on recharge, but such data sets are rare. The climate of the Canadian prairies is characterized by large inter-annual and inter-decadal variability in precipitation, which provides opportunities to examine the response of groundwater recharge to changes in meteorological conditions. A decadal study was conducted in a small (250 km(2)) prairie watershed in Alberta, Canada. Relative magnitude of annual recharge, indicated by water-level rise, was significantly correlated with a combination of growing-season precipitation and snowmelt runoff, which drives depression-focussed infiltration of meltwater. Annual precipitation was greater than vapour flux at an experimental site in some years and smaller in other years. On average precipitation minus vapour flux was 10 mm y(-1), which was comparable to the magnitude of watershed-scale groundwater recharge estimated from creek baseflow. Average baseflow showed a distinct shift from a low value (4 mm y(-1)) in 1982-1995 to a high value (15 mm y(-1)) in 2003-2013, indicating the sensitivity of groundwater recharge to a decadal-scale variability of meteorological conditions.

AB  - A Abstraction, diversion, and storage of flow alter rivers worldwide. In this context, minimum flow regulations are applied to mitigate adverse impacts and to protect affected river reaches from environmental deterioration. Mostly, however, only selected instream criteria are considered, neglecting the floodplain as an indispensable part of the fluvial ecosystem. Based on essential functions and processes of unimpaired temperate floodplain rivers, we identify fundamental principles to which we must adhere to determine truly ecologically-relevant environmental flows. Literature reveals that the natural flow regime and its seasonal components are primary drivers for functions and processes of abiotic and biotic elements such as morphology, water quality, floodplain, groundwater, riparian vegetation, fish, macroinvertebrates, and amphibians, thus preserving the integrity of floodplain river ecosystems. Based on the relationship between key flow regime elements and associated environmental components within as well as adjacent to the river, we formulate a process-oriented functional floodplain flow (ff-flow) approach which offers a holistic conceptual framework for environmental flow assessment in temperate floodplain river systems. The ff-flow approach underlines the importance of emulating the natural flow regime with its seasonal variability, flow magnitude, frequency, event duration, and rise and fall of the hydrograph. We conclude that the ecological principles presented in the ff-flow approach ensure the protection of floodplain rivers impacted by flow regulation by establishing ecologically relevant environmental flows and guiding flow restoration measures.

AB  - Freshwater resources in the North China Plain (NCP) are near depletion due to the unceasing overexploitation of deep groundwater, by far the most significant source of freshwater in the region. To deal with the deepening freshwater crisis, brackish water (rich but largely unused water in agriculture) is increasingly being used in irrigation in the region. However, inappropriate irrigation with brackish water could lead to soil salinization and cropland degradation. To evaluate such negative impacts, the HYDRUS-1D model was used to simulate soil salt transport and accumulation under 15 years of irrigation with brackish water. The irrigation scenarios included brackish water irrigation during the wintering and jointing stages of winter wheat and then freshwater irrigation just before the sowing of summer maize. Freshwater irrigation was done to leach out soil salts, which is particularly vital in dry years. For the littoral region of the plain, HYDRUS-ID was used to simulate the irrigated cropping system stated above for a total period of 15 years. The results showed that it was feasible to use brackish water twice in one year, provided freshwater irrigation was performed before sowing summer maize. Freshwater irrigation, in conjunction with precipitation, leached out soil salts from the 100 cm root-zone depth. The maximum salt accumulation was in the 160-220 cm soil layer, which ensured that root-zone soil was free of restrictive salinity for crop growth. Precipitation was a critical determinant of the rate and depth leaching of soil salt. Heavy rainfall (> 100 mm) caused significant leaching of soluble salts in the 0-200 cm soil profile. Salt concentration under brackish water irrigation had no significant effect on the variations in the trend of soil salt transport in the soil profile. The variations of soil salinity were mainly affected by hydrological year type, for which the buried depth of soil salt was higher in wet years than in dry years. The study suggested that 15 years of irrigation with brackish water is a reliable and feasible mode of crop production in coastal regions with a thick soil column above the water table. The scheme proposed in this study allowed the use of brackish water in irrigation without undue salinization of the crop soil layer, an intuitive way of resolving the deepening water crisis in the NCP study area and beyond.

AB  - Weather radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is in principle superior to the areal precipitation estimated by using rain gauge data only, and therefore has become increasingly popular in applications such as hydrological modeling. The present study investigates the potential of using multiannual radar QPE data in coupled surface watergroundwater modeling with emphasis given to the groundwater component. Since the radar QPE is partly dependent on the rain gauge observations, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of rain gauge network density on the quality of the estimated rainfall and subsequently the simulated hydrological responses. A headwater catchment located in western Denmark is chosen as the study site. Two hydrological models are built using the MIKE SHE code, where they have identical model structures expect for the rainfall forcing: one model is based on rain gauge interpolated rainfall, while the other is based on radar QPE which is a combination of both radar and rain gauge information. The two hydrological models are inversely calibrated and then validated against field observations. The model results show that the improvement introduced by using radar QPE data is in fact more obvious to groundwater than to surface water at daily scale. Moreover, substantial negative impact on the simulated hydrological responses is observed due to the cut down in operational rain gauge network between 2006 and 2010. The radar QPE based model demonstrates the added value of the extra information from radar when rain gauge density decreases; however it is not able to sustain the level of model performance preceding the reduction in number of rain gauges.

AB  - Understanding groundwater conditions in the upland parts of volcanic island aquifers is critical for sustainable groundwater development in these resource-limited environments. Yet groundwater conditions in such settings are generally difficult to characterize because of sparse well drilling (high cost and/or limited access). Information needed for resource evaluation includes upland depth to water, recharge rate, and aquifer permeability. In this study, noble-gas recharge temperatures and coupled heat/fluid flow modeling are used to indirectly infer these groundwater conditions. Mosteiros Basin on Fogo Island of the Cape Verde archipelago was selected as a representative volcanic island aquifer. Simulation results are calibrated to water-table altitude and temperature data, along with indirect information provided by noble and dissolved gases. Results of numerical modeling are most sensitive to recharge rates and hydraulic conductivity, less sensitive to basal heat flux, and not sensitive to porosity and thermal conductivity. Simulation results show that only a relatively narrow range of combined recharge values (12-25% of precipitation) and hydraulic conductivity (10(-8)-10(-7) m s(-1)) is consistent with observed data. The simulated recharge of 3-6 million cubic meters per year (Mm(3) yr(-1)) is much higher than measured discharge from the basin (0.25 Mm(3) yr(-1)), indicating the occurrence of significant amounts of submarine groundwater discharge. The modeling results suggest a very deep upland water table located 600-1000 m beneath the floor of the central caldera, although the water table becomes more shallow and accessible towards the coast. Perhaps most significant is the dominant role that modest amounts of recharge (mean rates of 70-140 mm yr(-1)) plays in decreasing the geothermal gradient, resulting in relatively cool temperatures in the deep vadose and at the water table. Noble-gas recharge temperatures, constrained by numerical simulation results, range from about 15 to 22 degrees C and indicate a large water-table temperature lapse of about -15 degrees C/km, much steeper than typical adiabatic lapse rates.

AB  - The trend towards construction of comprehensive dynamical numerical groundwater-surface water models to facilitate the examination of the quantitative status of groundwater resources by means of indicators is growing. A typical resource indicator is the assumption that the maximum abstraction should not exceed the groundwater recharge to an aquifer. From an aquatic, ecological point of view, the recommendation is only to exploit a small fraction of the recharge, in order to allow a significant fraction to supply wetlands and river systems. The paper proposes a set of four resource indicators for translating qualitative policy considerations on sustainable groundwater developments into quantitative criteria that can be evaluated by use of comprehensive hydrological models: (1) Indicator 1 is equal to a maximum abstraction of 35% of the pre-abstraction recharge; (2) Indicator 2 assumes a maximum 30% utilisation of current recharge; (3) Indicator 3 is identified as the abstraction at which mean river runoff is reduced by a maximum 10%, compared to pre-abstraction runoff; and (4) Indicator 4 is the abstraction at which baseflow is reduced by a maximum 5%, 10%, 15%, 25% and 50% aggregated for the reaches with the same environmental goal (e.g. a maximum 10% reduction of baseflow for salmonid spawning and nursery waters compared to pre-abstraction baseflow). The methodology for the design of the four ensemble resource indicators is described and the results of applying those indicators are demonstrated for assessment of the regional and national exploitable groundwater resources of Denmark.

AB  - The Mezquital Valley (MV) hosts the largest unmanaged aquifer recharge scheme in the world. The metropolitan area of Mexico City discharges similar to 60 m(3)/s of raw wastewater into the valley, a substantial share of which infiltrates into the regional aquifer. In this work, we aim to develop a comprehensive approach, adapted from oil and gas reservoir modeling frameworks, to assess water supply sources located downgradient from unmanaged aquifer recharge zones. The methodology is demonstrated through its application to the Mezquital Valley region. Geological, geoelectrical, petrophysical and hydraulic information is combined into a 3D subsurface model and used to evaluate downgradient supply sources. Although hydrogeochemical variables are yet to be assessed, outcomes suggest that the newly-found groundwater sources may provide a long-term solution for water supply. Piezometric analyses based on 25-year records suggest that the MV is close to steady-state conditions. Thus, unmanaged recharge seems to have been regulating the groundwater balance for the last decades. The transition from unmanaged to managed recharge is expected to provide benefits to the MV inhabitants. It will also be likely to generate new uncertainties in relation to aquifer dynamics and downgradient systems.

AB  - The southern Mesilla Basin, located within western Texas and southern New Mexico, is one of two major sources of groundwater for the city of El Paso, Texas, and provides similar to 30% of the region's domestic groundwater needs. Groundwater is also used for agriculture in the non-urbanized regions of the basin. The basin is one of the southernmost basins of the Rio Grande rift where extension has overprinted older features, including extensive Eocene trachyandesitic volcanism and Laramide deformation. An increase in groundwater salinity is observed from north to south within the basin. Some previous researchers have suggested that this salinity change is due to runoff and recharge from agricultural activity. We use a combination of gravity and groundwater geochemistry in an integrative study to determine the possible influences of faults and other subsurface structures on groundwater salinity and quality. Gravity studies suggest the presence of other fault systems within the basin that serve as conduits for deeper, warmer, more Si-rich waters in the northern part of our study area, and as recharge zones for Ca-rich surface runoff from the carbonates of the Franklin Mountains in the eastern portion of our study area. The high CI/Br ratios found in 90% of wells suggest that the salinity increase is primarily due to dissolution of evaporites within the basin rather than to deep-basin brines. Agricultural activity and water interaction with igneous and carbonate bedrock also are minor influences. This study highlights the unique resolving power of combining geophysical and geochemical techniques in understanding groundwater chemistry and its relationships with local geological structures. Such an approach can be readily applied to other systems with similar geologic and hydrological settings for groundwater exploration and resource management.

AB  - A semi-distributed hydrological model is developed, calibrated and validated against unregulated river discharge from the Tocantins-Araguaia River Basin, northern Brazil. Climate change impacts are simulated using projections from the 41 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models for the period 2071-2100 under the RCP4.5 scenario. Scenario results are compared to a 1971-2000 base line. Most climate models suggest declines in mean annual discharge although some predict increases. A large proportion suggest that the dry season experiences large declines in discharge, especially during the transition to the rising water period. Most models (>75%) suggest declines in annual minimum flows. This may have major implications for both current and planned hydropower schemes. There is greater uncertainty in projected changes in wet season and annual maximum discharges. Two techniques are investigated to reduce uncertainty in projections, but neither is able to provide more confidence in the simulated changes in discharge. [GRAPHICS]

AB  - Regions with unique habitats often harbor endemic taxa associated with temporally stable habitats. We identified such habitats that sustain endemic fishes in the plains of North America. We also summarized threats to their conservation and identified remnant habitats that still harbor endemic fishes (refuges) based on post-1989 surveys. Major springs, smaller, spring-fed streams, larger rivers, and euryhaline habitats were associated with a total of 49 endemics. Endemism was attributable to climatic refugia associated with each habitat type and dispersal limitation among major river drainages and springs. Forty-one endemic fishes (84%) were declining or extinct. Dewatering, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation were main causes of declines, often present together. Pollution and non-native species were also threats in many cases. Evidence for 53 existing refuges was found. We considered 34 refuges to be "high-quality" because they harbored three or more endemics. Twenty of these (those with available data) maintained consistent streamflow regimes for at least 50 years up to 2009. Case studies suggest high stream length, more natural flow regimes, and fewer direct human impacts are features of high-quality refuges, but extinction thresholds are unquantified and extinction debts of refuges are unknown. Limited information on past extinctions suggests drought, a natural feature of the plains, combines with other threats to eliminate remnant endemic populations. Long-term conservation planning requires identification, protection, and restoration of high-quality refuges to reduce extinction risk, especially during future drought periods. Planning should be integrated with regional water resource planning, given scarcity of water in the region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater resources in coastal plains area are coming under increasing threat due to over extraction and unsustainable agricultural practices. Sustainable water resource management in these areas can potentially be facilitated through the use of a novel concept in groundwater management. This concept involves matching supply and demand for irrigation water by managing excess monsoon season runoff and making it available for managed aquifer recharge (MAR), thereby allowing potentially greater extractions during the dry season. This includes the deliberate lowering of the groundwater table during the dry season, resulting in more storage capacity for MAR. In a case study the excess water was calculated and a field layout including ASR-wells and canals was developed. This groundwater management concept shows an additional potential infiltration of nearly 220 mm/a could be developed but field experiments showed problems which may be related to clogging of the injection wells. Additional enhancement of the natural recharge allows providing enough groundwater to grow a second crop during a year throughout nearly the whole area. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tuberculosis has become one of the deadliest global emergencies due to the widespread existence of multiple drug resistance strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the increase of immuno-compromised populations in large parts of the world. Although the complete genome of M. tuberculosis became available in 1998, opening unprecedented opportunities for target-specific drug development, the progress since then has been slow, mainly due to a lack of a sufficiently strong interest by pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. One of the most promising tools for future drug discovery lies in the elucidation of the molecular structures of potential drug targets from the M. tuberculosis proteome. During the last five years, the structures of about 200 unique targets have already been determined, which comprise about 5% of the entire M. tuberculosis proteome. As an example, we present the approach and some of the key achievements of the X-MTB consortium based in Germany. We summarize and discuss some recent highlights of potential drug targets of M. tuberculosis involved in lipid metabolism, protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and amino acid biosynthesis. The achievements of several structural genomics consortia that focus on targets from the M. tuberculosis proteome are now providing a solid framework to support coordinated international approaches for future structure-based drug discovery programs at the interface between industrial enterprises and academic research. One of the objectives will be to focus on target complexes, in addition to single targets that dominate the present repository of structures from the M. tuberculosis proteome.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture is a main user of groundwater. Achieving a sustainable use of groundwater will often require agricultural land-use changes such as shifting to entirely different kinds of crops and/or technologies. Enhanced understanding of land-use change is hence required for developing policies for a sustainable water future. We use an agent-based model to investigate the history of irrigated agriculture in the Upper Guadiana Basin, Spain, in order to learn about the influence of farmers' characteristics on land-use change and associated groundwater over-use. A shift from vineyards and cereals to horticultural crops would provide a possibility for higher income with less water use. Such a shift cannot be observed historically. The model results suggest that risk aversion and path dependency are insufficient to explain this observation, and the organisational set-up of farms limiting the maximum labour force needs to be considered as additional explanatory factor. Furthermore, it is shown that different types of farms existing in the UGB can be expected to exhibit distinct responses to drivers of land-use change such as agricultural policies. It is concluded that a sound understanding of the social system making use of a resource is required to solve problems of resource over-use. This article demonstrates that agent-based models can be useful tools to enhance such an understanding even in situations of scarce and uncertain data that are often encountered when dealing with resource-use problems.

AB  - This paper addresses issues on adaptive water management under the impact of climate change. Based on a set of comprehensive indicators of water system, a decision making approach of multi-objects is developed and applied to quantify water adaptive management for the demands of water sustainable use, water environmental protection and eco-water requirement under the climate change. For this study in China, two key indicators are proposed, namely (1) the water resources vulnerability (V) that was represented by integrated sensitivity (S) and resilience (C) of climate change impact on water resources, and (2) the sustainability of socio-economy and water environment, marked by DD, that is integrated scaler of socio-economic development (EG) based on the amount of GDP and the water environment and relative eco-system quality (LI). To find a reasonable solution for adaptive water management, a multi-objective decision making model of adaptive water management is further developed and the multi-objective model was transformed into an integrated single optimization model through developing an integrated measure function, called as VDD=DD/V. This approach has been applied to adaptive water resources planning and management for case study of China with new policy, called as the strict management of water resources based on three red line controls, i.e., the control of total water use by the total water resources allocation, the control of lower water use efficiency by the water demand management and the control of the total waste water load by water quality management in the Eastern China Monsoon Region that covers major eight big river basins including Yangtze River, Yellow River, Haihe River and Huaihe River. It is shown that the synthetic representation of water resource vulnerability and socio-economic sustainability by the integrated objective function (VDD) and integrated decision making model are workable and practicable. Adaptive management effect of the criterion compliance rate and water use efficiency are more appreciable through new water policy of the three red line controls, which can reduce 21.3% of the water resources vulnerability (V) and increase 18.4% of the sustainability of socioeconomy and water environment (DD) for the unfavorable scenario of climate change in 2030.

AB  - Environmental isotopes and C-14 dating were applied to estimate ages and recharge sources of deep groundwater (>= 150 m bgl) in south-east Bangladesh. With one exception, deep groundwater is shown to have been recharged more recently than 10 Ka (range 3-9 Ka, mean 7.6 Ka), under climatic conditions indicated by delta O-18 and delta H-2 as similar to the present day. Groundwater age distributions have been used to infer the scale of aquifer hydraulic anisotropy. 2D groundwater flow modelling is able to reproduce the observed vertical profiles of groundwater age, as determined at two locations, when the aquifer is assigned a permeability anisotropy (K-x/K-z) of at least 10(3). Under these conditions, deep groundwater originates as recharge in the hill regions at the eastern boundary of the basin. Recharge rates estimated from the groundwater ages are close to an estimate of the current rate of deep groundwater abstraction. Cautious development and careful monitoring are therefore necessary, as excessive deep groundwater pumping could draw dissolved arsenic from the shallow levels of the Bengal Aquifer System (BAS) and contaminate the deep groundwater resource.

AB  - Projected changes in climate are likely to substantially impact wetland hydrological conditions that will in turn have implications for wetland ecology. Assessing ecohydrological impacts of climate change requires models that can accurately simulate water levels at the fine-scale resolution to which species and communities respond. Hydrological conditions within the Lambourn Observatory at Boxford, Berkshire, UK were simulated using the physically based, distributed model MIKE SHE, calibrated to contemporary surface and groundwater levels. The site is a 10 ha lowland riparian wetland where complex geological conditions and channel management exert strong influences on the hydrological regime. Projected changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, channel discharge and groundwater level were derived from the UK Climate Projections 2009 ensemble of climate models for the 2080s under different scenarios. Hydrological impacts of climate change differ through the wetland over short distances depending on the degree of groundwater/surface-water interaction. Discrete areas of groundwater upwelling are associated with an exaggerated response of water levels to climate change compared to non-upwelling areas. These are coincident with regions where a weathered chalk layer, which otherwise separates two main aquifers, is absent. Simulated water levels were linked to requirements of the MG8 plant community and Desmoulin's whorl snail (Vertigo moulinsiana) for which the site is designated. Impacts on each are shown to differ spatially and in line with hydrological impacts. Differences in water level requirements for this vegetation community and single species highlight the need for separate management strategies in distinct areas of the wetland. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Climate change will impact fluvial ecosystems through changes in the flow regime. Physical habitat is an established measure of a river's ecological status when assessing changes to flow. Yet, it requires extensive datasets, is site specific, and does not account for dynamic processes; shortcomings that the use of hydrological and hydraulic models may alleviate. Here, simulated flows along a 600 m reach of the River Lambourn, Boxford, UK, were extracted from the 1D MIKE 11 hydraulic component of an integrated MIKE SHE model of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology River Lambourn Observatory. In-channel seasonal macrophyte growth and management through cutting alter water levels, represented in the hydraulic model by manipulating channel bed roughness ( Manning's n). Assessment of climate change used outputs from the UK Climate Projections 2009 ensemble of global climate models for the 2080s. River discharge outputs were disaggregated to provide velocity and depth profiles across 41 cross sections along the reach. These were integrated with habitat suitability criteria for brown trout (Salmo trutta) to generate a measure of available physical habitat. The influence of macrophyte growth caused the habitat-discharge relationship to be unusable in evaluating the sensitivity of brown trout to flow changes. Instead, projected time series were used to show an overall reduction in habitat availability, more for adult than juvenile trout. Results highlighted the impact of weed cutting, and its potential role in mitigating both flood risk and the ecological impacts of climate change. The use of a hydraulic model to assess physical habitat availability has worldwide applicability.

AB  - Understanding hydrological processes in wetlands may be complicated by management practices and complex groundwater/surface water interactions. This is especially true for wetlands underlain by permeable geology, such as chalk. In this study, the physically based, distributed model MIKE SHE is used to simulate hydrological processes at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire, UK. This comprises a 10-ha lowland, chalk valley bottom, riparian wetland designated for its conservation value and scientific interest. Channel management and a compound geology exert important, but to date not completely understood, influences upon hydrological conditions. Model calibration and validation were based upon comparisons of observed and simulated groundwater heads and channel stages over an equally split 20-month period. Model results are generally consistent with field observations and include short-term responses to events as well as longer-term seasonal trends. An intrinsic difficulty in representing compressible, anisotropic soils limited otherwise excellent performance in some areas. Hydrological processes in the wetland are dominated by the interaction between groundwater and surface water. Channel stage provides head boundaries for broad water levels across the wetland, whilst areas of groundwater upwelling control discrete head elevations. A relic surface drainage network confines flooding extents and routes seepage to the main channels. In-channel macrophyte growth and its management have an acute effect on water levels and the proportional contribution of groundwater and surface water. The implications of model results for management of conservation species and their associated habitats are discussed. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Hydrological processes in small catchments are not quite understood yet, which is true in particular for catchments in data scarce, semi-arid regions. This is in contrast with the need for a better understanding of water fluxes and the interactions between surface-and groundwater in order to facilitate sustainable water resources management in such environments, where both floods and droughts can result in severe crop loss. In this study, event runoff coefficient analysis and limited tracer data of four small, nested sub-catchments (0.4-25.3 km(2)) in a data scarce, semi-arid region of Tanzania helped to characterize the distinct response of the study catchments and to gain insights into the dominant runoff processes. The estimated event runoff coefficients were very low and did not exceed 0.09. They were found to be significantly related to the 5-day antecedent precipitation totals as well as to base flow, indicating a close relation to changes in soil moisture and thus potential switches in runoff generation processes. The time scales of the "direct flow" reservoirs, used to compute the event runoff coefficients, were up to one order of magnitude reduced for extreme events, compared to "average" events, suggesting the activation of at least a third flow component, besides base-and direct flow, assumed to be infiltration overland flow. Analysis of multiple tracers highlighted the importance of pre-event water to total runoff, even during intense and high yield precipitation events. It further illustrated the distinct nature of the catchments, in particular with respect to the available water storage, which was suggested by different degrees of tracer damping in the individual streams. The use of multiple tracers subsequently allowed estimating uncertainties in hydrograph separations arising from the use of different tracers. The results highlight the presence of considerable uncertainties, emphasizing the need for multiple tracers in order to avoid misleading results. This study shows the value of hydrological data collection over one whole wet season using multi-tracers to improve the understanding of hydrological functioning and thus for water resources management in data scarce, semi-arid environments.

AB  - The sustainable use of groundwater has become increasingly challenging due to extreme hydrological events and anthropogenic activity. In this study, the basin-scale groundwater response to precipitation variation was analyzed using an integrated model that comprises lumped models for land and river recharges and a distributed model for groundwater. The integrated model was applied to the Chih-Ben watershed, Taiwan, using 20 years (1988-2007) of data. The hydrological data were analyzed for trends using statistical tests. Based on decreasing trends in precipitation and groundwater levels and an increasing trend in stream flow, the oblique-cut method was applied to precipitation and excess infiltration to assess land and streambed recharge. Distributed numerical groundwater modeling was used to simulate the basin-scale groundwater responses to precipitation variation and anthropogenic pumping. The model was calibrated using stable-isotope and groundwater-level data. The safe yields were estimated for the Chih-Ben watershed for dry, wet, and normal precipitation scenarios. The safe yield of groundwater was shown to vary with precipitation, which does not guarantee the sustainable use of groundwater resources. Instead, water resources should be assessed at a basin scale, taking into account the whole ecosystem, rather than only considering water for human consumption in the alluvium.

AB  - Riverbank filtration (RBF) for water supplies is used widely throughout the world because it guarantees a sustainable quantity and improves water quality. In this study, the development history and the technical overview of RBF in China are reviewed and summarized. Most RBF systems in China were constructed using vertical wells, horizontal wells, and infiltration galleries in flood plains, alluvial fans, and inter-mountain basins. Typical pollutants such as NH4+, pathogens, metals, and organic materials were removed or diluted by most RBF investigated. There have recently been many investigations of the interaction between groundwater and surface water and biogeochemical processes in RBF. Comprehensive RBF applications should include not only the positive but also negative effects. Based on a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages, the perspectives of China's RBF technology development were proposed. To protect the security of water supply, China's RBF systems should establish a management system, monitoring system and forecasting system of risk. Guidelines of RBF construction and management should also be issued on the basic of relevant fundamental investigations such as climate influence, clogging, and purification mechanism of water-quality improvement.

AB  - North China Plain (NCP) is one of the most important agricultural production regions in China. A severe water shortage, due to intensive irrigation, exists in the plain. In NCP, crop water-use accounts for 70% of total groundwater use in the floodplains and over 87% in the piedmont regions. Surface water in the plain is limited and restricted for urban water supply. Agricultural production therefore heavily relies on groundwater irrigation; the main driver of groundwater depletion in the region. To address the water shortage issue, a flexible and sustainable water management method is proposed. The method integrates crop-growth and groundwater model, and ensures groundwater recovery via agricultural water-saving. The method is successfully tested for the 4763 km(2) Shijiazhuang Irrigation District in the piedmont region of Mount Taihang. The model results show that 29.2% or 135.7 mm reduction in irrigation could stop groundwater drawdown in the plain. An additional 10% reduction in irrigation pumping (i.e., a total of 39.2% or 182.1 mm) would induce groundwater recovery and restoration to the pre-development hydrologic conditions of 1956 in about 74 years. The farmers' current irrigation practices are inefficient and wasteful of the limited water resources. Under appropriate irrigation schemes therefore, grain yield loss as a result of the 39.2% agricultural water-saving is less than 10%. This minimal agronomic loss is economically acceptable, giving the ecological and environmental benefits of groundwater recovery in the study area. However, successful agricultural water-saving requires not only practical feasibility of models, but also sufficient political commitment, promotion of water-saving incentives and efficient water-saving technologies, and enforcement of sustainable water management policies.

AB  - Hazard risk assessment of land subsidence is a complicated issue aiming at identifying areas with potentially high environmental hazard due to land subsidence. The methods of hazard risk assessment of land subsidence were reviewed and a new systematic approach was proposed in this study. Quantitative identification of land subsidence is important to the hazard risk assessment. Field observations using extensometers were used to determine assessment indexes and estimate weights of each index. Spatial modelling was also established in ArcGIS to better visualize the assessment data. These approaches then were applied to the Chengnan region, China as a case study. Three factors, thickness of the second confined aquifer, thickness of the soft clay and the annual recovery rate of groundwater level were incorporated into the hazard risk assessment index system. The weights of each index are 0.33, 0.17 and 0.5 respectively. The zonation map shows that the high, medium and low risk ranked areas for land subsidence account for 9.5 %, 44.7 % and 45.8 % of the total area respectively. The annual recovery rate of groundwater level is the major factor raising land subsidence hazard risk in approximately half of the study area.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to examine a deficit in water for the Hsinchu area, the location of Taiwan's "Silicon Valley." The methods suggested in this paper to diagnose water shortage problems are simple and practical. The results show that Hsinchu is in an area without sufficient water to meet demand for domestic and industrial uses. Until the completion of the Baoshan II Reservoir in 2006, the most feasible options for the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation to offset the water deficiency in Hsinchu City over the next five years are: (a) to obtain water gratuitously from the southern Yungheshan Reservoir; (b) to import additional water at an extra charge from other sources such as the northern Shihmen Reservoir and the agricultural sector; and (c) to conduct a comprehensive water conservation program at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park.

AB  - Understanding groundwater-pumpage sources is essential for assessing impacts on water resources and sustainability. The objective of this study was to quantify pumping impacts and sources in dipping, unconfined/confined aquifers in the Gulf Coast (USA) using the Texas Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer. Potentiometric-surface and streamflow data and groundwater modeling were used to evaluate sources and impacts of pumpage. Estimated groundwater storage is much greater in the confined aquifer (2,200 km(3)) than in the unconfined aquifer (170 km(3)); however, feasibility of abstraction depends on pumpage impacts on the flow system. Simulated pre-development recharge (0.96 km(3)/yr) discharged through evapotranspiration (ET, similar to 37%), baseflow to streams (similar to 57%), and to the confined aquifer (similar to 6%). Transient simulations (1980-1999) show that pumpage changed three out of ten streams from gaining to losing in the semiarid south and reversed regional vertical flow gradients in similar to 40% of the entire aquifer area. Simulations of predictive pumpage to 2050 indicate continued storage depletion (41% from storage, 32% from local discharge, and 25% from regional discharge capture). It takes similar to 100 yrs to recover 40% of storage after pumpage ceases in the south. This study underscores the importance of considering capture mechanism and long-term system response in developing water-management strategies.

AB  - Many groundwater systems consist of multi-scale aquifer units. The exchange processes and rates between these aquifer units are complex. In order to manage such complex systems, a subdivision into different catchments, sub-catchments or groundwater bodies as manageable units is required. The sustainable management of water resources requires a comprehensive view of water-quality and water-quantity aspects not only for water supply issues, but generally also for flood protection and riverine ecosystem functions. Such transformations require an improved understanding of recharge and exchange processes between different aquifer units as well as aquifer-surface water interaction-processes at different spatiotemporal scales. The main objective of this study is to illustrate concepts by defining the geometry and scales of different aquifer units within a sedimentary basin. The Laufen Basin in the Jura Mountains represents a sub-catchment of the River Birs (Switzerland). Its structure is characterized by a pronounced local relief and a series of aquifer units which are typical for many complex groundwater systems in front of mountain chains such as the alpine foreland and the Jura Mountains of Central Europe. A combination of different concepts is required to understand multi-scale flow systems and to describe the various hydrogeological processes. Three concepts are proposed for the Laufen Basin, including: (1) a regional flow-system analysis, based on the concept of hierarchical groundwater flow systems; (2) the river-corridor concept for understanding aquifer-surface water interaction processes; and (3) the calculation of the dynamic vulnerability index and the aquifer base gradient approach for karst flow and fractured flow systems.

AB  - This review assesses the potential of the African continent to contribute to the three main targets of the new science decade of IAHS (Panta Rhei): understanding, estimation and prediction, and science in practice. The continent has an extremely diverse climate and physical environment, and is faced with many problems in the interaction between hydrology and society. While inadequate financial and institutional resources often constrain the pursuit of high-level scientific research, there is substantial hydrological research capacity within Africa. The topics covered over the past decade have partly anticipated some of the research themes adopted as part of the Panta Rhei initiative. African hydrological scientists should therefore be in a better position to make future contributions, largely because their research is already grounded in applications linked to societal needs. Some of the papers reviewed and included in the special issue of Hydrological Sciences Journal introduced in this paper reflect international partnerships, while others reflect emerging partnerships between institutions within Africa.

AB  - Aquifer sustainable yields are often defined as a single value based on long-term averages or annual values of recharge. However, these time scales can be too coarse for the systems to which they are being applied and can lead to over- or underexploitation of groundwater. A numerical model of the Querenca-Silves aquifer in Portugal is used to develop hypothetical scenarios in which abstraction rates for public water supply are adapted at various time-scales and are defined based on a percentage of the recharge which occurred during the previous period. The purpose is to understand the effects and feasibility of varying the temporal scale at which groundwater abstraction is modified in order to maximise sustainable yield and minimise freshwater losses. Results show that, for the Querenca-Silves aquifer, reducing the time scale for which sustainable yield is defined allows for an increase in withdrawal volumes whilst maintaining the sustainability of the system. In fact, not reducing the temporal scale leads to an irretrievable loss of freshwater during recharge periods. Furthermore, predicted seasonal changes in rainfall for Portugal will make taking the temporal scale of the system into account more important, as the concentration of recharge into a shorter period will lead to faster depletion.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to understanding the importance of four factors on the determination of sustainable yields: (i) aquifer properties; (ii) temporal distribution of recharge; (iii) temporal distribution of groundwater pumping; and (iv) spatial distribution of pumping wells. It is important to comprehend how the present-day and future vulnerability of groundwater systems to pumping activities depend on these critical factors and what the risks are of considering sustainable yield as a fixed percentage of mean annual recharge (MAR). A numerical model of the QuerencaSilves aquifer in Portugal is used to develop hypothetical scenarios with which these factors are studied. Results demonstrate the aquifer properties, particularly the storage coefficient, have an important role in determining the resilience of an aquifer and therefore to which degree it is dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of abstraction and recharge, as well as the occurrence of extreme events. Sustainable yields are determined for the developed scenarios based on specific criteria rather than a fraction of MAR. Under simplified current recharge and abstraction conditions, the sustainable yield was determined at approximately 73% of MAR or 76 million?m3. When considering a concentration of rainfall in time, as predicted by climate scenarios for the region, sustainable yield could drop to ca 70% of MAR. However, a more even distribution of pumping volumes throughout the year could increase this value. The location of the pumping wells is seen to affect the distribution of hydraulic heads in the aquifer, albeit without significant changes in sustainable yield.

AB  - Predicted changes in climate will lead to seawater intrusion in the Queren double dagger a-Silves (QS) coastal aquifer (south Portugal) during the coming century if the current water-resource-management strategy is maintained. As for much of the Mediterranean, average rainfall is predicted to decrease along with increasing seasonal and inter-annual variability and there is a need to understand how these changes will affect the sustainable use of groundwater resources. A density-coupled flow and transport model of the QS was used to simulate an ensemble of climate, water-use and adaptation scenarios from 2010 to 2099 taking into account intra- and inter-annual variability in recharge and groundwater use. By considering several climate models, bias correction and recharge calculation methods, a degree of uncertainty was included. Changes in rainfall regimes will have an immediate effect on groundwater discharge; however, the effect on saltwater intrusion is attenuated by the freshwater-saltwater interfaces' comparatively slow rate of movement. Comparing the effects of adaptation measures demonstrates that the extent of intrusion in the QS is controlled by the long-term water budget, as the effectiveness of both demand and supply oriented measures is proportional to the change in water budget, and that to maintain the current position, average groundwater discharge should be in the order of 50 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1).

AB  - The knowledge about groundwater flow conditions within the Southeastern Taoudeni Basin Aquifer shared by Burkina Faso and Mali is relatively limited with very little information on potentiometric heads, recharge processes, residence time and water quality. A better evaluation of groundwater resources in this area is a strategic point for water resources management in the entire Soudano-Sahelian region which endures since the beginning of the twentieth century a continuous decrease in precipitation amount. This paper provides a transboundary synthesis using water (O-18, H-2 and H-3) and carbon isotopes (C-13 and C-14) in conjunction with hydrogeological and hydrochemical data. The objectives are to improve the conceptual model of groundwater recharge and flow within this sandstone reservoir, and to assess the changes in the aquifer due to water abstraction and recent climate changes including an insight into Sahelian aquifers palaeorecharge processes. The local meteoric water line for the Bobo-Dioulasso station is proposed: delta H-2 = 8.0 (+/- 0.5)delta O-18 + 10.2 (+/- 2.1). Two main tendencies can be derived from groundwater chemistry. First, a slight evolution from the Ca-Mg-HCO3 type towards a Na-K-HCO3 type that indicates developed interactions between groundwater and clay minerals related to the residence time of groundwater. A second tendency towards Cl-NO3-SO4-HCO3 water types indicates the anthropogenic influence on groundwater related to the poor sanitary conditions observed around wells. The carbon-14 activity measured on the TDIC varies between 0.3 and 122 pmC, so our record contains samples covering a wide period from Actual to Pleistocene suggesting a continuous recharge of the system through time even if the Sahel region has endured many different climate phases which have influenced the infiltration and recharge processes. All groundwater samples have stable isotope compositions in the range of the present day regional and global meteoric water line which suggests that the sampled groundwater was not significantly affected by evaporation during recharge. Evolved waters are depleted relative to unevolved samples by 1.5-2 parts per thousand in delta O-18 and 10-15 parts per thousand. in delta H-2. The whole dataset support the hypothesis of a largely unified homogeneous aquifer system with a multilayered structure but it also points out the very low renewability of the resource and a strong anthropogenic contamination of the shallowest horizons.

AB  - Indicators of the impact on freshwater resources are becoming increasingly important in the evaluation of urban water systems. To reveal the importance of spatial resolution, we investigated how the choice of catchment scale influenced the freshwater impact assessment. Two different indicators were used in this study: the Withdrawal-To-Availability ratio (WTA) and the Water Stress Index (WSI). Results were calculated for three groundwater based Danish urban water supplies (Esbjerg, Aarhus, and Copenhagen). The assessment was carried out at three spatial levels: (1) the groundwater body level, (2) the river basin level, and (3) the regional level. The assessments showed that Copenhagen's water supply had the highest impact on the freshwater resource per cubic meter of water abstracted, with a WSI of 1.75 at Level 1. The WSI values were 1.64 for Aarhus's and 0.81 for Esbjerg's water supply. Spatial resolution was identified as a major factor determining the outcome of the impact assessment. For the three case studies, WTA and WSI were 27%-583% higher at Level 1 than impacts calculated for the regional scale. The results highlight that freshwater impact assessments based on regional data, rather than sub-river basin data, may dramatically underestimate the actual impact on the water resource. Furthermore, this study discusses the strengths and shortcomings of the applied indicator approaches. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that although WSI has the highest environmental relevance, it also has the highest uncertainty, as it requires estimations of non-measurable environmental water requirements. Hence, the development of a methodology to obtain more site-specific and relevant estimations of environmental water requirements should be prioritized. Finally, the demarcation of the groundwater resource in aquifers remains a challenge for establishing a consistent method for benchmarking freshwater impacts caused by groundwater abstraction.

AB  - Water sustainability in megacities is a growing challenge with far-reaching effects. Addressing sustainability requires an integrated, multidisciplinary approach able to capture interactions among hydrology, population growth, and socioeconomic factors and to reflect changes due to climate variability and land use. We developed a new systems modeling framework to quantify the influence of changes in land use, crop growth, and urbanization on groundwater storage for Beijing, China. This framework was then used to understand and quantify causes of observed decreases in groundwater storage from 1993 to 2006, revealing that the expansion of Beijing's urban areas at the expense of croplands has enhanced recharge while reducing water lost to evapotranspiration, partially ameliorating groundwater declines. The results demonstrate the efficacy of such a systems approach to quantify the impacts of changes in climate and land use on water sustainability for megacities, while providing a quantitative framework to improve mitigation and adaptation strategies that can help address future water challenges.

AB  - The trouble with groundwater is that despite its critical importance to global water supplies, it frequently attracts insufficient management attention relative to more visible surface water sources, irrespective of regional climate, socioeconomic profile, and regulatory environment. To this end, the recently defined sub-discipline of socio-hydrogeology, an extension of socio-hydrology, seeks to translate and exchange knowledge with and between non-expert end-users, in addition to involving non-expert opinion and experience in hydrogeological investigations, thus emphasising a bottom-up methodology. It is widely acknowledged that issues pertaining to groundwater quality, groundwater quantity, climate change, and a poor general awareness and understanding of groundwater occurrence and movement are global in their scope. Moreover, while effective communication and engagement represent the key tenet of socio-hydrogeology, the authors consider that multiple actors should be identified and incorporated using stakeholder network analysis and may include policymakers, media and communications experts, mobile technology developers, and social scientists, to appropriately convey demographically focused bi-directional information, with the hydrogeological community representing the communication keystone. Accordingly, this article aims to highlight past and current work, elucidate key areas of development within socio-hydrogeology, and offer recommendations to ensure global efficacy of this increasingly important and growing field going forward. The authors seek to assist in protecting our global groundwater resource for future generations via an improved framework for understanding the interaction between communities and hydrogeological systems.

AB  - The aim is to define the mechanism of chemical reactions that are responsible for the salinization of the Azraq basin along groundwater flow path, using inverse modeling technique by PHREEQC Interactive 2.8 for Windows. The chemical analysis of representative groundwater samples was used to predict the causes of salinization of groundwater. In addition, the saturation indices analysis was used to characterize the geochemical processes that led to the dissolution of mineral constituents within the groundwater aquifer system. According to the modeling results, it was noted that the groundwater at the recharge area was undersaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, and halite. Thus, the water dissolved these minerals during water rock interaction, and therefore, the concentration of Ca, Mg, Na, and SO4 increased along the groundwater flow path. Furthermore, the groundwater at the discharge area was oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite. This meant that the water would precipitate these minerals along the flow path, while the water was undersaturated with respect to gypsum and halite throughout the simulated path; this showed the dissolution processes that take place during water-rock interaction. Therefore, the salinity of the groundwater increased significantly along the groundwater flow paths.

AB  - Agriculture, rapid urbanization and geochemical processes have direct or indirect effects on the chemical composition of groundwater and aquifer geochemistry. Hydro-chemical investigations, which are significant for assessment of water quality, were carried out to study the sources of dissolved ions in groundwater of Dinajpur district, northern Bangladesh. The groundwater samplish were analyzed for physico-chemical properties like pH, electrical conductance, hardness, alkalinity, total dissolved solids and Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, CO32-, HCO3-, SO42- and Cl- ions, respectively. Based on the analyses, certain parameters like sodium adsorption ratio, soluble sodium percentage, potential salinity, residual sodium carbonate, Kelly's ratio, permeability index and Gibbs ratio were also calculated. The results showed that the groundwater of study area was fresh, slightly acidic (pH 5.3-6.4) and low in TDS (35-275 mg l(-1)). Ground water of the study area was found suitable for irrigation, drinking and domestic purposes, since most of the parameters analyzed were within the WHO recommended values for drinking water. High concentration of NO3- and Cl- was reported in areas with extensive agriculture and rapid urbanization. Ion-exchange, weathering, oxidation and dissolution of minerals were major geochemical processes governing the groundwater evolution in study area. Gibb's diagram showed that all the samples fell in the rock dominance field. Based on evaluation, it is clear that groundwater quality of the study area was suitable for both domestic and irrigation purposes.

AB  - Understanding pathways of recharge to alluvial aquifers is important for maintaining sustainable access to groundwater resources. Water balance modelling is often used to proportion recharge components and guide sustainable groundwater allocations. However, it is not common practice to use hydrochemical evidence to inform and constrain these models. Here we compare geochemical versus water balance model estimates of artesian discharge into an alluvial aquifer, and demonstrate why multi-tracer geochemical analyses should be used as a critical component of water budget assessments. We selected a site in Australia where the Great Artesian Basin (GAB), the largest artesian basin in the world, discharges into the Lower Namoi Alluvium (LNA), an extensively modelled aquifer, to convey the utility of our approach. Water stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and the concentrations of Na+ and HCO3- suggest a continuum of mixing in the alluvial aquifer between the GAB (artesian component) and surface recharge, whilst isotopic tracers (H-3, C-14, and Cl-36) indicate that the alluvial groundwater is a mixture of groundwaters with residence times of <70 years and groundwater that is potentially hundreds of thousands of years old, which is consistent with that of the GAB. In addition, Cl- concentrations provide a means to calculate a percentage estimate of the artesian contribution to the alluvial groundwater. In some locations, an artesian contribution of up to 70% is evident from the geochemical analyses, a finding that contrasts with previous regional-scale water balance modelling estimates that attributed 22% of all inflow for the corresponding zone within the LNA to GAB discharge. Our results show that hydrochemical investigations need to be undertaken as part of developing the conceptual framework of a catchment water balance model, as they can improve our understanding of recharge pathways and better constrain artesian discharge to an alluvial aquifer.

AB  - The interconnections between groundwater and river systems remain poorly understood in many catchments throughout the world. and yet they are fundamental to effectively managing the quantity and quality of water resources. Many of the techniques traditionally employed by hydrogeologists and hydrologists rely on characterising the groundwater flow systems, topography, geology/aquifer systems, climate and/or the rainfall-runoff processes within a river basin. These studies can provide useful process characterisations that are fundamental to developing a physical understanding of hydrological processes within a specified region. However, in many instances the findings are descriptive and the results are difficult to up-scale to the larger sub-catchment/catchment scale at which water is managed and allocated. Moreover, they may have significant time and cost requirements. An alternative approach is to collate a range of hydrometric data, that for many catchments may already available, and to then analyse data patterns and infer processes from the data without being overly concerned about the details of the physical processes driving the system taking a top-down approach. In this paper the river reaches in the semi-arid Namoi River catchment in Australia were characterised according to three levels of information; namely: (1) presence of aquifer-river hydraulic connection; (2) dominant direction of flux; and (3) the potential for groundwater extraction to impact on river flows. The methods used to characterise the river reaches included an analysis of: (1) groundwater and river channel base elevations using a GIS/database; (2) stream hydrograph data; (3) flow duration data: (4) vertical aquifer connectivity at nested piezometer sites; and (5) paired river and groundwater hydrographs. The data patterns seen in the stream gauging station derived data for gaining, losing and variably gaining-losing river reaches were described together with the general processes that operate in these systems. Subsequently, a map was prepared for the Namoi River catchment river reaches indicating aquifer-river connectivity and dominant direction of flux. The potential for groundwater extraction to impact on river flows was also assessed and found to be a significant issue for the connected aquifer-river systems. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Allocations of river and groundwater have been traditionally managed separately in Australia and many other parts of the world even though in many regions groundwater and river systems are hydraulically connected. Groundwater extractions in areas where river systems are hydraulically connected can cause substantial impacts to river flows particularly base flows or low flows, which are considered to be ecologically important. Traditional groundwater modelling approaches tend to be undertaken on time-scales of weeks or months and are not sufficient to demonstrate the impacts of groundwater extractions in many river systems, particularly where flows are ephemeral. The impacts of groundwater extraction on surface water flows is considered using a simple, conceptual, lumped-parameter modelling approach called IHACRES_GW. The Coxs Creek catchment in the Namoi River Basin, New South Wales is used as a case study. Groundwater extractions are having significant impacts on base flows in this area and current policies will not be effective in reducing these impacts. These findings demonstrate the potential of such a modelling approach, when used in conjunction with traditional groundwater models, in setting allocation limits to assess impacts on river flows.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to estimate groundwater recharge using an optimization-based water-table fluctuation method combined with a groundwater balance model in an arid hardrock-alluvium region, located at the Oman-United Arab Emirates border. We introduce an effective hardrock thickness term to identify the percentage of the considered hardrock thickness in which effective groundwater flow takes place. The proposed method is based upon a Thiessen polygon zoning approach. The method includes subpolygons to represent specific geologic units and to enhance the confidence of the estimated groundwater recharge. Two linear and 1 nonlinear submodels were developed to evaluate the model components for the calibration (October 1996 to September 2008) and validation (October 2008 to September 2013) periods. Long-term annual groundwater recharge from rainfall and return flow over the model domain are estimated as 24.62 and 5.71Mm(3), respectively, while the effective groundwater flow circulation is found to occur in the upper 7% of the known hardrock thickness (42m), confirming conclusions of previous field studies. Considering a total difference in groundwater levels between eastern and western points of the study area of the order of 220m and a 12-year monthly calibration period, a weighted root mean squared error in predicted groundwater elevation of 2.75m is considered quite reasonable for the study area characterized by remarkable geological and hydrogeological diversity. The proposed approach provides an efficient and robust method to estimate groundwater recharge in regions with a complex geological setting in which interaction between fractured and porous media cannot be easily assessed.

AB  - Increased irrigation in the Neishaboor watershed, Iran, during the last few decades has caused serious groundwater depletion, making the development of comprehensive mitigation strategies and tools increasingly important. In this study, SWAT and MODFLOW were employed to integratively simulate surface-water and groundwater flows. SWAT and MODFLOW were iteratively executed to compute spatial and temporal distributions of hydrologic components. The combined SWAT-MODFLOW model was calibrated (2000-2010) and validated (2010-2012) based on streamflow, wheat yield, groundwater extraction, and groundwater-level data. This multi-criteria calibration procedure provided greater confidence for the partitioning of water between soil storage, actual evapotranspiration, and aquifer recharge. The SWAT model provided satisfactory predictions of the hydrologic budget for the watershed outlet. It also provided good predictions of irrigated wheat yield and groundwater extraction. The 10-year mean annual recharge rate estimated using the combined model varied greatly, ranging from 0 to 960 mm, with an average of 176 mm. This result showed good agreement with the independently estimated annual recharge rate from an earlier study. The combined model provides a robust tool for the sustainable planning and management of water resources for areas with stressed aquifers where interaction between groundwater and surface water cannot be easily assessed.

AB  - Global agricultural production is heavily sustained by irrigation, but irrigation system efficiencies are often surprisingly low. However, our knowledge of irrigation efficiencies is mostly confined to rough indicative estimates for countries or regions that do not account for spatiotemporal heterogeneity due to climate and other biophysical dependencies. To allow for refined estimates of global agricultural water use, and of water saving and water productivity potentials constrained by biophysical processes and also nontrivial downstream effects, we incorporated a process-based representation of the three major irrigation systems (surface, sprinkler, and drip) into a bio- and agrosphere model, LPJmL. Based on this enhanced model we provide a gridded world map of irrigation efficiencies that are calculated in direct linkage to differences in system types, crop types, climatic and hydrologic conditions, and overall crop management. We find pronounced regional patterns in beneficial irrigation efficiency (a refined irrigation efficiency indicator accounting for crop-productive water consumption only), due to differences in these features, with the lowest values (< 30 %) in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and the highest values (> 60 %) in Europe and North America. We arrive at an estimate of global irrigation water withdrawal of 2469 km(3) (2004-2009 average); irrigation water consumption is calculated to be 1257 km(3), of which 608 km(3) are non-beneficially consumed, i.e., lost through evaporation, interception, and conveyance. Replacing surface systems by sprinkler or drip systems could, on average across the world's river basins, reduce the non-beneficial consumption at river basin level by 54 and 76 %, respectively, while maintaining the current level of crop yields. Accordingly, crop water productivity would increase by 9 and 15 %, respectively, and by much more in specific regions such as in the Indus basin. This study significantly advances the global quantification of irrigation systems while providing a framework for assessing potential future transitions in these systems. In this paper, presented opportunities associated with irrigation improvements are significant and suggest that they should be considered an important means on the way to sustainable food security.

Examples are given of the real-world problems that can be addressed using this system. These include water-resource assessment, reservoir site selection, decontamination of groundwater, estimation of sustainable irrigation abstractions and derivation of required effluent-quality standards. The requirement in both cases is to provide the analytical tools to be used by the agency staff themselves for planning purposes.

AB  - Overexploitation of groundwater is a common problem in the Pingtung Plain area of Taiwan, resulting in substantial drawdown of groundwater levels as well as the occurrence of severe seawater intrusion and land subsidence. Measures need to be taken to preserve these valuable groundwater resources. This study seeks to spatially determine the most suitable locations for the use of surface water on this plain instead of extracting groundwater for drinking, irrigation, and aquaculture purposes based on information obtained by combining groundwater quality analysis and a numerical flow simulation assuming the planning of manmade lakes and reservoirs to the increase of water supply. The multivariate indicator kriging method is first used to estimate occurrence probabilities, and to rank townships as suitable or unsuitable for groundwater utilization according to water quality standards for drinking, irrigation, and aquaculture. A numerical model of groundwater flow (MODFLOW) is adopted to quantify the recovery of groundwater levels in townships after model calibration when groundwater for drinking and agricultural demands has been replaced by surface water. Finally, townships with poor groundwater quality and significant increases in groundwater levels in the Pingtung Plain are prioritized for the groundwater conservation planning based on the combined assessment of groundwater quality and quantity. The results of this study indicate that the integration of groundwater quality analysis and the numerical flow simulation is capable of establishing sound strategies for joint groundwater and surface water use. Six southeastern townships are found to be suitable locations for replacing groundwater with surface water from manmade lakes or reservoirs to meet drinking, irrigation, and aquaculture demands.

AB  - Because of limited surface water in reservoirs during a long term drought, this work aimed to locate clean and safe groundwater mixing with surface water for agricultural use in the Chianan plain, southwestern Taiwan subject to its hydrochemical parameters. Based on a standard of water quality for irrigation, multivariate indicator kriging (MVIK) was used to estimate integration of several hydrochemical parameters of groundwater mixing with surface water and to characterize spatial uncertainty. Different utilization ratios (UR) of groundwater regarded as multiple estimated thresholds significantly improved single-threshold drawbacks in previous studies. Recommended regions were determined under various groundwater utilization conditions according to probabilities estimated by MVIK The analyzed results illustrate that groundwater plays a subordinate role in development of agricultural water resources in this plain. After proper dilution with surface water (UR = 0.5 and 0.25), approximately 48.9% of this plain can supply groundwater for irrigation. The northern, northeastern and eastern aquifers are excellent locations to extract groundwater mixing with equal or triple amounts of surface water. The research results provide agricultural administrators and farmers with simple guidelines to obtain sufficient and reliable water for maintaining sustainable production of crops during a long term drought.

AB  - Accurately estimating a spatial pattern of low permeability topsoil materials, such as clay, silt, and mud, is critical because these materials are a natural barrier to groundwater recharge and flow in subsurface engineering applications. This study determined the spatial distributions and thicknesses of low permeability topsoil materials in the Choushui River alluvial fan, Taiwan by using a combined ordinary indicator kriging (OIK) approach with multiple thresholds. The thicknesses were first estimated using ordinary kriging (OK). To reduce the overestimation of low values and underestimation of high values, indicator kriging (IK) was then adopted to probabilistically categorize the thickness of the materials. The maximum occurrence probability among the categories was selected for determining the most suitable thickness category of low permeability topsoil materials. Finally, the thicknesses of the materials estimated using OK were amended according to the upper and lower limits of the most suitable category determined using multi-threshold IK. The research results reveal that the combined OIK approach with multiple thresholds can reduce the overestimation of low values and underestimation of high values for various topsoil thicknesses and characterize a reliable hydrogeological pattern in topsoil. The approach facilitates evaluating groundwater recharge and constructing a numerical model of coupled surface water and groundwater flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conditions of water quality and quantity are two key factors impacting groundwater utilization for irrigation. To obtain pristine groundwater and reduce pumping impacts on aquifers, this study establishes an irrigation management plan of sustainable groundwater in the Pingtung Plain in Taiwan based on the spatial variability of water quality and quantity parameters. According to an irrigation water quality standard, multivariate indicator kriging (IK) was adopted to estimate the integration of hydrochemical parameters in groundwater. IK was also used to grade transmissivity fields representing the pumping capacity of aquifers. Six risk categories of recommended groundwater used for irrigation were spatially delineated based on combinations of five levels of groundwater quality and quantity determined by estimated probabilities. The analyzed results indicate that 54.4% of aquifers are recommended to extract groundwater for irrigation. The aquifers belonging to excellent categories are the optimal locations, where groundwater can be used for irrigation without dilution. The aquifers belonging to ordinary categories are the regions, where groundwater mixed with surface water is appropriate for use in irrigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work evaluated the spatial variability and distribution of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity (K) ill the Choushui River alluvial fan in Taiwan, using ordinary kriging (OK) and mean and individual sequential Gaussian simulations (SGS). A baseline flow model constructed by upscaling parameters was inversely calibrated to determine the pumping and recharge rates. Simulated heads using different K realizations were then compared with historically measured heads. A global/local simulated error between simulated and measured heads was analysed to assess the different spatial variabilities of various estimated K distributions. The results of a MODFLOW simulation indicate that the OK realization had the smallest sum of absolute mean simulation errors (SAMSE) and the SGS realizations preserved the spatial variability of the measured K fields. Moreover, the SAMSE increases as the spatial variability of the K field increases. The OK realization yields small local simulation errors in the measured K field of moderate magnitude, whereas the SGS realizations have small local simulation errors in the measured K fields, with hi,,h and low values. The OK realization of K can be applied to perform a deterministic inverse calibration. The mean SGS method is suggested for constructing a K field when the application focuses on extreme values of estimated parameters and S mall calibration errors, such as in a simulation of contaminant transport in heterogeneous aquifers. The individual SGS realization is useful in stochastically assessing the spatial uncertainty of highly heterogeneous aquifers. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Because of potential impacts of global warming on the occurrence of increasing drought events, this work was to determine locations for groundwater emergency utilization in the Taipei Basin subject to conditions of groundwater quality and quantity. Multivariate indicator kriging was first used to probabilistically define regions with pristine groundwater quality which complies with the drinking water quality standard in Taiwan. Then, the groundwater flow model, MODFLOW, was adopted to simulate groundwater drawdown for specified pumping rates arranged in determined candidate zones with pristine groundwater quality during a six-month drought period. To reduce impacts on land subsidence by pumping, zones of pristine groundwater quality with minimizing pumping drawdown were the optimal locations to extract groundwater for domestic uses. Finally, a feasible scheme of groundwater emergency utilization during drought was proposed based on locations of current water supply plants and land-use. The analyzed results of combining groundwater quality and quantity reveal that two regions, the southern and eastern Taipei Basins, are feasible locations to pump groundwater during drought owing to characteristics of excellent groundwater quality and low pumping drawdown. After considering existent conditions of water supply plants and land-use, the southern Taipei Basin is recommended to extract groundwater for domestic uses, whereas groundwater in the eastern Taipei Basin is only limited for non-drinking purposes.

AB  - Seawater intrusion is one of the most serious environmental problems in many coastal regions all over the world. Mixing a small quantity of seawater with groundwater makes it unsuitable for use and can result in abandonment of aquifers. Therefore, seawater intrusion should be prevented or at least controlled to protect groundwater resources. This paper presents development and application of a simulation-optimization model to control seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers using different management scenarios; abstraction of brackish water, recharge of freshwater, and combination of abstraction and recharge. The model is based on the integration of a genetic algorithm optimisation technique and a coupled transient density-dependent finite element model. The objectives of the management scenarios include determination of the optimal depth, location and abstraction/recharge rates for the wells to minimize the total costs for construction and operation as well as salt concentrations in the aquifer. The developed model is applied to analyze the control of seawater intrusion in a hypothetical confined coastal aquifer. The efficiencies of the three management scenarios are examined and compared. The results show that combination of abstraction and recharge wells is significantly better than using abstraction wells or recharge wells alone as it gives the least cost and least salt concentration in the aquifer. The results from this study would be useful in designing the system of abstraction/recharge wells to control seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers and can be applied in areas where there is a risk of seawater intrusion.

AB  - Groundwater quality and quantity are two major challenges in arid and semi-arid regions, due to their critical roles in sustainable agricultural development. Irrigated lands are spread all over Urmia Lake's surrounding plains in Iran. Due to the risk of saltwater intrusion as a result of over-exploitation from groundwater resources, it is important to monitor the groundwater quality and quantity through time and space. In this paper, the groundwater quantity was assessed over 11 years applying a novel groundwater balance estimation method based on water table data and 3D modeling; groundwater quality were monitored over 10 years using GIS and geostatistics; and the saltwater intrusion were investigated through generated quality maps and regression analysis. Results indicate that the groundwater balance was negative during the study period. Furthermore, the aquifers quality decreased over the study period, which was severe in west and southwest of the study area. The saltwater intrusion was proved and salty water was spread from west to other zones. The saltwater intrusion into aquifers increased electrical conductivity, chloride and sodium concentrations and will cause many ecological and agricultural problems. The novel and practicable approach utilized for groundwater balance quantitative assessment is suitable for countries lacking hydrological properties databases.

AB  - Groundwater is a treasured underground resource, which plays a central role in sustainable water management. However, it being hidden and dynamic in nature, its sustainable development and management calls for precise quantification of this precious resource at an appropriate scale. This study demonstrates the efficacy of three GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques, viz., Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Catastrophe and Entropy in evaluating groundwater potential through a case study in hard-rock aquifer systems. Using satellite imagery and relevant field data, eight thematic layers (rainfall, land slope, drainage density, soil, lineament density, geology, proximity to surface water bodies and elevation) of the factors having significant influence on groundwater occurrence were prepared. These thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights based on the conceptual frameworks of AHP, Catastrophe and Entropy techniques and then they were integrated in the GIS environment to generate an integrated raster layer depicting groundwater potential index of the study area. The three groundwater prospect maps thus yielded by these MCDA techniques were verified using a novel approach (concept of 'Dynamic Groundwater Potential'). The validation results revealed that the groundwater potential predicted by the AHP technique has a pronounced accuracy of 87% compared to the Catastrophe (46% accuracy) and Entropy techniques (51% accuracy). It is concluded that the AHP technique is the most reliable for the assessment of groundwater resources followed by the Entropy method. The developed groundwater potential maps can serve as a scientific guideline for the cost-effective siting of wells and the effective planning of groundwater development at a catchment or basin scale.

AB  - The paper describes a set of modelling utilities (a root-zone model, a grid-distribution tool, and a modified Modflow-2000 model) that can be used to simulate the water cycle of a city in terms of root-zone water balance, water supply, wastewater, storm runoff, groundwater flow, streamflow, and the interactions between these subsystems. The utilities are used to simulate the water cycle in the Copenhagen area (976 km(2)) during the period 1850-2003. Long-term time series of hydraulic head, streamflow, and inflow to sewage works have been used to manually calibrate the model parameters. We used a step-wise calibration strategy, using different parts of the data in the various steps, to calibrate hydrogeological parameters, storm runoff parameters, and parameters governing the interactions between groundwater and leaky pipe systems, respectively. Simulations indicate that present rates of groundwater leakage into streams, lakes, and wetlands constitute 60% of pre-urbanization levels due to massive groundwater extraction. However, the current problems of groundwater shortages and streamflow depletion would have been far worse, if precipitation had not increased by 20% since 1850. Model simulations indicate that urbanization has lowered current groundwater recharge due to the establishment of impervious areas and due to negligible contributions from leaky pipe systems. This is opposite to the reported general tendency of enhanced recharge due to urbanization. However, current recharge rates within Copenhagen are simulated to be 20% higher than prior to urbanization, which is attributed to the increase in precipitation during the study period.

AB  - An approach is presented for the evaluation of groundwater potential using remote sensing, geographic information system, geoelectrical, and multi-criteria decision analysis techniques. The approach divides the available hydrologic and hydrogeologic data into two groups, exogenous (hydrologic) and endogenous (subsurface). A case study in Salboni Block, West Bengal (India), uses six thematic layers of exogenous parameters and four thematic layers of endogenous parameters. These thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights which were normalized by analytic hierarchy process and eigenvector techniques. The layers were then integrated using ArcGIS software to generate two groundwater potential maps. The hydrologic parameters-based groundwater potential zone map indicated that the 'good' groundwater potential zone covers 27.14% of the area, the 'moderate' zone 45.33%, and the 'poor' zone 27.53%. A comparison of this map with the groundwater potential map based on subsurface parameters revealed that the hydrologic parameters-based map accurately delineates groundwater potential zones in about 59% of the area, and hence it is dependable to a certain extent. More than 80% of the study area has moderate-to-poor groundwater potential, which necessitates efficient groundwater management for long-term water security. Overall, the integrated technique is useful for the assessment of groundwater resources at a basin or sub-basin scale.

AB  - The consequences of unsustainable use of groundwater are becoming increasingly evident worldwide, particularly in developing nations. Groundwater management is a serious problem in many parts of the world. The prime concern is how to achieve groundwater sustainability. Artificial recharge techniques coupled with water harvesting hold a great promise for groundwater sustainability. The main intent of this paper is to highlight salient cost-effective and easy-to-use methods for augmenting groundwater resources in the alluvial hydrogeologic setting. Based on the intensive field investigation in a groundwater basin of Japan, three low-cost and easy-to-implement recharge techniques are suggested for alluvial aquifer systems, viz., augmentation of river flow, recharge through irrigation/drainage canals, and recharge from paddy fields. The source of recharge water for these recharge techniques is surface water supply. The efficacy of these methods or approaches has been demonstrated. It is emphasized that such cost-effective methods of groundwater recharge are key to sustainable groundwater management in both developing and developed countries. These methods must not be overlooked in the midst of sophisticated and highly expensive methods.

AB  - Growing water scarcity in West Midnapore district of West Bengal, India, is threatening sustainable agricultural production as well as sanitation of the inhabitants. Because of its several inherent qualities, groundwater can play an important rote in ensuring sustainable water supply in the district. This study was carried out to assess groundwater condition in the Salboni Block of West Midnapore district using surface resistivity method. Vertical electrical sounding (VES) surveys were carried out at 38 sites using the Schlumberger array. The apparent resistivity-depth datasets (henceforth called 'VES data') thus obtained were interpreted by the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique. A GA-based stand-alone computer program was developed for optimizing subsurface layer parameters (true resistivity and thickness) from the VES data. The optimal layer parameters were then correlated with the available well togs to identify aquifer and confining layers. Moreover, a groundwater potential map was created by integrating the thematic layers of aquifer resistivity and thickness in a GIS environment. In order to explore the spatial variation of layer resistivity at a particular depth, resistivity contour maps of the study area for different depths were prepared using ArcView software. The GA technique yielded layer parameters with reasonably low values of root mean square error (0.36-9.75 Omega m) for most VES datasets. It was found that shallow aquifers exist at depths ranging from 4 to 19 m and relatively deep aquifers from 24 to 60 m below the ground surface. The study area is classified into 'very good', 'good', 'moderate' and 'poor' groundwater potential zones, with a majority of the area having good to moderate groundwater prospect. The resistivity contour maps for different depths revealed that deeper aquifers are prevalent in the study area. It is concluded that the GA technique is efficient and reliable for determining subsurface layer parameters from the VES data and that the developed groundwater potential map is useful for effective groundwater development in the study area.

AB  - In irrigated semi-arid and and regions, accurate knowledge of groundwater recharge is important for the sustainable management of scarce water resources. The Campo de Cartagena area of southeast Spain is a semi-arid region where irrigation return flow accounts for a substantial portion of recharge. In this study we estimated irrigation return flow using a root zone modelling approach in which irrigation, evapo-transpiration, and soil moisture dynamics for specific crops and irrigation regimes were simulated with the HYDRUS-1D software package. The model was calibrated using field data collected in an experimental plot. Good agreement was achieved between the HYDRUS-1D simulations and field measurements made under melon and lettuce crops. The simulations indicated that water use by the crops was below potential levels despite regular irrigation. The fraction of applied water (irrigation plus precipitation) going to recharge ranged from 22% for a summer melon crop to 68% for a fall lettuce crop. in total, we estimate that irrigation of annual fruits and vegetables produces 26 hm(3) y(-1) of groundwater recharge to the top unconfined aquifer. This estimate does not include important irrigated perennial crops in the region, such as artichoke and citrus. Overall, the results suggest a greater amount of irrigation return flow in the Campo de Cartagena region than was previously estimated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study was carried out in the northern part of the Aquitaine Basin extending in Southwest France. The basin has been intensively exploited for various purposes for many years. Although the geological context is well known, there are still some gaps in the knowledge about the hydrogeochemical regime, groundwater average residence time and the palaeohydrological conditions prevailing during the recharge period which would help to secure sustainable exploitation of the resources. Environmental isotopes (180, (2)H, (3)H, (13)C) together with radiocarbon were used to evaluate hydrochemical evolution, residence time and palaeorecharge conditions for Jurassic, Cretaceous and Eocene aquifers. Radiocarbon activity in the aquifers varies widely between 0 and 94 pmc. After radiocarbon corrections the ages indicate both modern and old waters sometimes exceeding the limit for (14)C dating. The Fontes and Garnier model is best adapted to the specificity of the carbonate system. The content in stable isotopes of water is varying between -7.7% and -4.9% for delta(18)O and -52.3 parts per thousand to -29.6 parts per thousand for delta(2)H. The wide ranges of stable isotopic values imply variable climatic conditions. A group of isotopically depleted samples was detected, indicating colder climatic conditions during the recharge. Radiocarbon ages calculation, together with isotopic signature, point out that the depletion in stable isotopic values fits the period between 20 and 15 ka B.P. and therefore indicate the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). According to the correction model, the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene would occur between 15 and 12 ka B.P. Palaeohydrological data from the Northern Aquitaine Basin does not confirm a significant hiatus in the recharge history. The recharge conditions in South Europe seem to have occurred under discontinuous permafrost conditions as documented by many palaeoclimatological archives. This is in favour of an uninterrupted recharge of the confined aquifers of Northern Aquitaine Basin. Such information should be considered by modellers in their attempts to simulate the hydrogeological functioning of large confined aquifers on the very long time range. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Estimation of groundwater recharge is essential for sustainable groundwater management planning in arid and semiarid areas. Accurate recharge estimation in a distributed scale is a great challenge, especially when multiple recharge sources exist and available data are limited and uncertain. There are various sophisticated direct and indirect methods such as water balance method to estimate this parameter. Conventional spatially and temporally lumped models cannot take into account spatial variation of hydraulic properties of an aquifer, land use, and hydrometeorological conditions in the water balance estimation. In this study, a semi-distributed hydrologic model is developed and applied in a complex alluvial-karst system in Firouzabad catchment (Iran) to estimate groundwater recharge from precipitation, subsurface inflow from adjacent karst aquifer, return flows, and riverbed infiltration. The proposed multi-compartment model considers groundwater balance in alluvial and karstic aquifers and surface soil layer. Furthermore, it contains a multi-cell aquifer model which is used to understand the macro mechanism of the alluvial aquifer. A parameter calibration procedure is implemented wherein groundwater head data are used in parameter estimation. The performance of the proposed model is assessed by evaluating the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the coefficient of efficiency. The results of the groundwater balance model are analyzed to quantify the seasonal longterm (16 years, from 1992 to 2008) groundwater recharge components. The proposed model is straightforward, efficient, and easy to apply, and its results are reasonable and acceptable.

AB  - More than 99% of water use in Denmark is based on groundwater. Denmark has had a comprehensive national groundwater-monitoring programme since 1988 based on 74 well catchment areas and six small agricultural catchments with more than 1,500 screens at different depths for regular, mostly annual, water quality sampling. In addition, water samples from 10,000 abstraction wells are analysed every 3-5 years. The water is analysed for main components, inorganic trace elements, organic micro pollutants, and pesticides and their metabolites. A unique feature is the 20-year time-series data of inorganic pollutants. Groundwater modelling supports traditional monitoring to improve the conceptual geological understanding and to assess the quantitative status and the interaction between groundwater and surface water. The programme has been continuously adjusted to incorporate new knowledge from research programmes and meet new policy demands, currently the European Union Water Framework Directive, particularly with respect to an increased focus on quantitative aspects and on the groundwater/surface water interaction. The strengths and weaknesses of the Danish programme are assessed and compared with other national groundwater-monitoring programmes. Issues discussed include: strategic considerations for monitoring design, the link between research and monitoring, and adoption of responses to climate changes.

AB  - Rapid groundwater depletion from the northwestern Indian aquifer system in the western Indo-Gangetic basin has raised serious concerns over the sustainability of groundwater and the livelihoods that depend on it. Sustainable management of this aquifer system requires that we understand the sources and rates of groundwater recharge, however, both these parameters are poorly constrained in this region. Here we analyse the isotopic (delta O-18, delta H-2 and tritium) compositions of groundwater, precipitation, river and canal water to identify the recharge sources, zones of recharge, and groundwater flow in the Ghaggar River basin, which lies between the Himalayan -fed Yamuna and Sutlej River systems in northwestern India. Our results reveal that local precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge. However, depleted delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures at some sites indicate recharge from canal seepage and irrigation return flow. The spatial variability of delta O-18, delta H-2, d -excess, and tritium reflects limited lateral connectivity due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the aquifer system in the study area. The variation of tritium concentration with depth suggests that groundwater above c. 80 mbgl is generally modern water. In contrast, water from below c. 80 mbgl is a mixture of modern and old waters, and indicates longer residence time in comparison to groundwater above c. 80 mbgl. Isotopic signatures of delta O-18, delta H-2 and tritium suggest significant vertical recharge down to a depth of 320 mbgl. The spatial and vertical variations of isotopic signature of groundwater reveal two distinct flow patterns in the aquifer system: (i) local flow (above c. 80 mbgl) throughout the study area, and (ii) intermediate and regional flow (below c. 80 mbgl), where water recharges aquifers through large-scale lateral flow as well as vertical infiltration. The understanding of spatial and vertical recharge processes of groundwater in the study area provides important baseline knowledge for developing a sustainable groundwater management plan for the northwestern Indian aquifer system.

AB  - Groundwater and surface water are often closely coupled and are both under the influence of multiple stressors. Stressed groundwater systems may lead to a poor ecological status of surface waters but to date no conceptual framework to analyse linked multi-stressed groundwater - surface water systems has been developed. In this paper, a framework is proposed showing the effect of groundwater on surface waters in multiple stressed systems. This framework will be illustrated by applying it to four European catchments, the Odense, Denmark, the Regge and Dinkel, Netherlands, and the Thames, UK, and by assessing its utility in analysing the propagation or buffering of multi-stressors through groundwater to surface waters in these catchments. It is shown that groundwater affects surface water flow, nutrients and temperature, and can both propagate stressors towards surface waters and buffer the effect of stressors in space and time. The effect of groundwater on drivers and states depends on catchment characteristics, stressor combinations, scale and management practises. The proposed framework shows how groundwater in lowland catchments acts as a bridge between stressors and their effects within surface waters. It shows water managers how their management areas might be influenced by groundwater, and helps them to include this important, but often overlooked part of the water cycle in their basin management plans. The analysis of the study catchments also revealed a lack of data on the temperature of both groundwater and surface water, while it is an important parameter considering future climate warming.

AB  - Policymakers in arid and semiarid basins face hard choices on water policies needed for adaptation to climate change. Hydro-economic modeling is a state-of-the art approach that can be used to guide the design and implementation of these policies in basins. A major gap in developments of hydro economic modeling to date has been the weak integration of physically-based representations of water sources and uses such as the interaction between ground and surface water resources, to inform complex basin scale policy choices. This paper presents an integrated hydro-economic modeling framework to address this gap with application to an important and complex river basin in Spain, the Jucar basin, for the assessment of a range of climate change scenarios and policy choices. Results indicate that in absence of adequate policies protecting water resources and natural ecosystems, water users will strategically deplete reservoirs, aquifers and river flows for short-term adaptation to climate change, disregarding the impacts on the environment and future human activities. These impacts can be addressed by implementing sustainable management policies. However, these policies could have disproportionate costs for some stakeholders groups, and their opposition may undermine attempts at sustainable policy. These tradeoffs among water policy choices are important guides to the design of policies aimed at basin wide adaptation to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interactions between groundwater and surface water play a fundamental role in the functioning of riparian ecosystems. In the context of sustainable river basin management it is crucial to understand and quantify exchange processes between groundwater and surface water. Numerous well-known methods exist for parameter estimation and process identification in aquifers and surface waters. Only in recent years has the transition zone become a subject of major research interest; thus, the need has evolved for appropriate methods applicable in this zone. This article provides an overview of the methods that are currently applied and described in the literature for estimating fluxes at the groundwater - surface water interface. Considerations for choosing appropriate methods are given including spatial and temporal scales, uncertainties, and limitations in application. It is concluded that a multi-scale approach combining multiple measuring methods may considerably constrain estimates of fluxes between groundwater and surface water.

AB  - There is currently a need for a review of the definition and methodology of determining sustainable yield. The reasons are: (1) current definitions and concepts are ambiguous and non-physically based so cannot be used for quantitative application, (2) there is a need to eliminate varying interpretations and misinterpretations and provide a sound basis for application, (3) the notion that all groundwater systems either are or can be made to be sustainable is invalid, (4) often there are an excessive number of factors bound up in the definition that are not easily quantifiable, (5) there is often confusion between production facility optimal yield and basin sustainable yield, (6) in many semi-arid and and environments groundwater systems cannot be sensibly developed using a sustained yield policy particularly where ecological constraints are applied. Derivation of sustainable yield using conservation of mass principles leads to expressions for basin sustainable, partial (non-sustainable) mining and total (non-sustainable) mining yields that can be readily determined using numerical modelling methods and selected on the basis of applied constraints. For sonic cases there has to be recognition that the groundwater resource is not renewable and its use cannot therefore be sustainable. In these cases, its destiny should be the best equitable use.

AB  - Fractured rock aquifers continue to support millions of people in arid and semiarid regions. However, due to heterogeneous nature of their hydrogeology and comparative low yields, research in these formations is regarded expensive, and thus, very little is known about their dominant hydrological processes. In this study, we corroboratively used pumping test and stable isotopic data to understand groundwater recharge and flow processes in fractured hornblende-biotite-gneiss. It was established that rain is the main source of groundwater recharge. The groundwater system seems to retain the stable isotopic signatures of precipitation which has undergone evaporation before infiltration. Geochemical data also show that the groundwater system has not undergone pronounced geochemical evolution as evidenced by low total dissolved solids in both seasons. A combination of stable isotopic data and derivative plots of drawdown data helped identification of apparent recharge zones, no-flow boundaries and dominant flow types in the pumped wells with bilinear flow being the dominant type of flow in BP1 and BP2, while linear flow was dominant in BP3 and BP4. Geochemical, stable isotopic and hydraulic data further revealed hydraulic connection between two wells juxtaposed across Ntcheu Fault, indicating potential for groundwater flow across the fault and highlighting that the fault may be acting as a groundwater conduit across it. The established phenomena are important when considering groundwater development and sustainable management of the resource.

AB  - Egypt has embarked on an ambitious desert land reclamation program in order to increase total food production. Energy planners for these desert agriculture locations have chosen diesel generation power technology because minimization of the initial capital cost of a power supply system is their top priority. This heavy reliance on diesel generation has negative effects on the surrounding environment including soil, groundwater, and air pollution. Although good solar and wind resource prospects exist for the use of cleaner hybrid power systems in certain desert locations, little research has been done to investigate the economic potential of such systems in Egypt's desert agriculture sector. Using optimization software, we assess the economics of hybrid power systems versus the present diesel generation technology in a remote agricultural development area. We also consider the emission reduction advantages of using hybrid systems. Interestingly enough, optimization results show that hybrid systems are less costly than diesel generation from a net present cost perspective even with the high diesel fuel price subsidies. Since hybrids are also more environmentally friendly, they represent a strong step towards achieving sustainable desert agriculture. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Grombalia aquifer (NE Tunisia) is an example of an important source of water supply for regional and national development, where the weak controls over abstraction, fertilizer application and waste disposal, coupled with limited knowledge of aquifer dynamics, is causing aquifer over-exploitation and water quality degradation. Assessing the key role of groundwater in water-resources security is therefore of paramount importance to support new actions to preserve water quality and quantity in the long-run. This study presents one of the first investigations targeted at a complete assessment of aquifer dynamics in the Grombalia aquifer. A multi-tracer hydrogeochemical and isotopic (delta H-2, delta O-18 and H-3) approach was used to study the influence of seasonal variation on piezometric levels, chemical and isotopic compositions, and groundwater recharge. A total of 116 samples were collected from private wells and boreholes during three periods in a 1 year monitoring campaign (February-March 2014, September 2014 and February 2015). Results revealed the overall unsuitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes (NO3 > 50 mg/L in 51% of the wells; EC > 1,000 mu S/cm in 99% of the wells). Isotopic balance coupled to piezometric investigation indicated the contribution of the shallow aquifer to deep groundwater recharge. The study also revealed the weakness of 'business as usual' management practices, highlighting possible solutions to tackle water-related challenges in the Grombalia region, where climate change, population growth and intensive agricultural activities have generated a large gap between demand and available water reserves, hence becoming a possible driver for social insecurity.

AB  - Based on the long-term monitoring data of rainfall, groundwater levels, groundwater abstraction, spring flow rates and groundwater quality, an assessment has been undertaken of the sustainable yield of a karst aquifer system in Shandong Province, northern China, to maintain perennial outflow of the karst springs while meeting water demands. One of the fundamental indicators for sustainable yield of groundwater is identified as maximum allowable water-level drawdown. A regional three-dimensional finite-difference numerical model has been developed to optimize the schemes associated with well fields and their locations and sustainable yields, in the Jinan spring catchment and its adjacent karst groundwater catchments, with the aim of maintaining the water level higher than the allowable lowest water level of 27.5 m above sea level. Furthermore, measures necessary to move towards sustainable use of the karst groundwater are outlined, drawing on contingency plans of water-source replacement and artificial recharge, dual water supply (based in water quality), use of the spring waters themselves, and groundwater quality protection.

AB  - Intensive irrigation causes major consumption of ground water resources especially in India. Due to a large population base, the extraction of ground water for mechanized agriculture has significantly increased during the last few decades in the Bist Doab region of Punjab, India. This study analyses the spatial pattern of changes in ground water levels in the Bist Doab region during the 1998-2011 period. Using spatial interpolation, the ground water levels were interpolated for the whole region for each year. Spatial data on the intensity of irrigation and tubewell density were also mapped to analyse their trends. The results reveal the emergence of a zone of deepening water table in the south west portion of the Bist Doab. The ground water levels have dropped more than 20 meters from the surface in this area. Using these results, we classified the Bist Doab region into three zones (Zone 1, 2, and 3) for prioritizing ground water management initiatives. While agricultural water consumption provides one possible explanation for falling ground water levels in the area, other non-anthropogenic factors may also play a role in such trends. Further research at the same scale is recommended in other parts of the Punjab State.

AB  - This paper introduces many objective robust decision making (MORDM). MORDM combines concepts and methods from many objective evolutionary optimization and robust decision making (RDM), along with extensive use of interactive visual analytics, to facilitate the management of complex environmental systems. Many objective evolutionary search is used to generate alternatives for complex planning problems, enabling the discovery of the key tradeoffs among planning objectives. RDM then determines the robustness of planning alternatives to deeply uncertain future conditions and facilitates decision makers' selection of promising candidate solutions. MORDM tests each solution under the ensemble of future extreme states of the world (SOW). Interactive visual analytics are used to explore whether solutions of interest are robust to a wide range of plausible future conditions (i.e., assessment of their Pareto satisficing behavior in alternative SOW). Scenario discovery methods that use statistical data mining algorithms are then used to identify what assumptions and system conditions strongly influence the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the robust alternatives. The framework is demonstrated using a case study that examines a single city's water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, USA. Results suggest that including robustness as a decision criterion can dramatically change the formulation of complex environmental management problems as well as the negotiated selection of candidate alternatives to implement. MORDM also allows decision makers to characterize the most important vulnerabilities for their systems, which should be the focus of ex post monitoring and identification of triggers for adaptive management.

AB  - Extensive use of groundwater for irrigation has significantly depleted the Ogallala aquifer, threatening the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the Southern Great Plains. There is a need to identify a low-water-requiring alternative crop and understand the response of that crop to deficit irrigation strategies. The objective of this study was to assess biomass partitioning and yield of spring canola (Brassica napus L.) under deficit irrigation. Three diverse canola cultivars ('H930', 'H955', and 'L140') were grown under four different irrigation treatments; full season irrigation (FI), no irrigation at the vegetative stage (VS), no irrigation at the reproductive stage (RS) and dryland (DL) at Clovis, NM, on Olton clay loam soil. Seed yield of VS was similar to Fl in both years but was greater by 93 and 200% in 2015 and by 120 and 263% in 2016 than RS and DL, respectively. Biomass and oil yield of VS were similar to those of FI in 2015 but were lower by 14% in 2016. Relieving water stress with irrigation at flowering increased leaf area index of VS and made it similar to that of FI by pod development stage. Biomass accumulation was greater in treatments receiving irrigation after flowering and most of the post-flowering biomass was partitioned into reproductive parts. Among yield components, greater 1000seed weight in VS than RS and DL, indicated recovery of canola stressed at the vegetative stage. Results indicated that if water is limited, the vegetative growth stage would be a better time to skip irrigation in spring canola.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the extent and geometrical characteristics of seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer of the eastern Thermaikos Gulf, Greece. Hydrochemical data and geoelectrical measurements were combined and supplemented to determine the hydrochemical regime of the study site in regard to seawater phenomena. Chemical analysis of groundwater was performed in 126 boreholes and fifteen electrical resistivity tomographies (ERT) were measured, whereas in two sites the ERT measurements were repeated following the wet season. The Cl- concentrations recorded reached 2240 mg/L indicating seawater intrusion which was also verified by ionic ratios. The ionic ratios were overlapped and a seawater intrusion map (SWIM) was produced. A significant part of the coastal aquifer (up to 150 km(2)) is influenced by seawater intrusion. The areas with the most intensive salinization are located between Nea Kallikratia-Epanomi and Aggelochori-Peraia. According to the ERTs, in the influenced areas the salinization of the aquifer exceeds 1 km toward the mainland and its depth reaches 200 m. In the area surrounding Thessaloniki airport the ERTs revealed salinization of the upper aquifer to depths of up to 40 m, whereas the lower aquifer is uninfluenced. This abnormal distribution of seawater intrusion demonstrates the value of geoelectrical methods in the study of seawater intrusion especially in areas with limited available hydrochemical data.

AB  - Freshwater scarcity is a pivotal challenge for many cities, as resources are threatened by increasing demand, water quality concerns, and climate change impacts. Current governance approaches appear unable to respond effectively to these challenges, prompting calls for transitions to sustainable water governance. Scenarios are often used to explore narrow aspects of water systems, which is not a full realization of their potential to guide transitions in water governance. A transition-oriented approach to scenario construction needs to generate scenarios that (i) are governance focused, including the institutions, actors, and actions that will guide transitions; (ii) are normative, incorporating the values and preferences of those responsible for carrying out transition actions; (iii) are presented as a small set of distinct and identifiable scenarios, which stakeholders can comprehend and compare; and (iv) allow for interfacing with dynamic models to demonstrate the systemic impacts of different approaches to water governance. This research utilizes a participatory, mixedmethod approach, including survey, scenario analysis, and simulation modeling to construct distinct, coherent, plausible, and normative governance scenarios of metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona in 2030. Four scenarios provide residents and policy makers with distinct options for future water governance regimes, indicating the future impacts of normative values and preferences that might or might not be aligned with ideas of sustainability.

AB  - Setting limit on groundwater extractions is important to ensure sustainable groundwater management. Lack of extraction data can affect interpretations of historical pressure changes, predictions of future impacts, accuracy of groundwater model calibration, and identification of sustainable management options. Yet, many groundwater extractions are unmetered. Therefore, there is a need for models that estimate extraction rates and quantify model outputs uncertainties arising due to a lack of data. This paper develops such a model within the Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) framework, using a case study of stock and domestic (SD) extractions in the Surat Cumulative Management Area, a predominantly cattle farming region in eastern Australia. Various types of extraction observations were used, ranging from metering to analytically-derived estimates. GLMs were developed and applied to estimate the property-level extraction amounts, where observation types were weighted by perceived relative accuracy, and well usage status. The primary variables found to affect property-level extraction rates were: yearly average temperature and rainfall, pasture, property area, and number of active wells; while variables most affecting well usage were well water electrical conductivity, spatial coordinates, and well age. Results were compared with analytical estimates of property-level extraction, illustrating uncertainties and potential biases across 20 hydrogeological units. Spatial patterns of mean extraction rates (and standard deviations) are presented. It is concluded that GLMs are well suited to the problem of extraction rate estimation and uncertainty analysis, and are ideal when model verification is supported by measurement of a random sample of properties.

AB  - Planning for "water-sensitive" cities has become a priority for sustainable urban development in Australia. There has been little quantification of the term, however. Furthermore, the water balance of most cities is not well known. Following prolonged drought, there has also been a growing need to make Australian cities more water self-reliant: to source water from within. This article formalizes a systematic mass-balance framework to quantify all anthropogenic and natural flows into and out of the urban environment. Quantitative performance indicators are derived, including (1) degree of system centralization; (2) overall balance; potential of (3) rainfall, (4) stormwater, and (5) wastewater to offset current demand; and (6) water cycle rate. Using the method, we evaluate Sydney, Melbourne, South East Queensland and Perth using reported and modeled data. The approach makes visible large flows of water that have previously been unaccounted and ignored. It also highlights significant intercity variation. In 2004-2005, the cities varied 54% to 100% in their supply centralization, 257% to 397% in the ratio of rainfall and water use, 47% to 104% in their potential stormwater recycling potential, and 26% to 86% in wastewater recycling potential. The approach provides a practical, water-focused application of the urban metabolism framework. It demonstrates how the principles of mass balance can help foster robust water accounting, monitoring, and management. More important, it contributes to the design and quantitative assessment of water-sensitive cities of the future.

AB  - A stochastic study of long-term forecasts of seawater intrusion with an application to the Korba aquifer (Tunisia) is presented. Firstly, a geostatistical model of the exploitation rates was constructed, based on a multi-linear regression model combining incomplete direct data and exhaustive secondary information. Then, a new method was designed and used to construct a geostatistical model of the hydraulic conductivity field by combining lithological information and data from hydraulic tests. Secondly, the effects of the uncertainties associated with the pumping rates and the hydraulic conductivity field on the 3D density-dependent transient model were analysed separately and then jointly. The forecasts of the impacts of two different management scenarios on seawater intrusion in the year 2048 were performed by means of Monte Carlo simulations, accounting for uncertainties in the input parameters as well as possible changes of the boundary conditions. Combining primary and secondary data allowed maps of pumping rates and the hydraulic conductivity field to be constructed, despite a lack of direct data. The results of the stochastic long-term forecasts showed that, most probably, the Korba aquifer will be subject to important losses in terms of regional groundwater resources.

AB  - This paper surveys the literature associated with the application of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in coastal groundwater management problems (CGMPs). This review demonstrates that previous studies were mostly relied on the application of limited and particular EAs, mainly genetic algorithm (GA) and its variants, to a number of specific problems. The exclusive investigation of these problems is often not the representation of the variety of feasible processes may be occurred in coastal aquifers. In this study, eight EAs are evaluated for CGMPs. The considered EAs are: GA, continuous ant colony optimization (CACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), artificial bee colony optimization (ABC), harmony search (HS), shuffled complex evolution (SCE), and simplex simulated annealing (SIMPSA). The first application of PSO, ABC, HS, and SCE in CGMPs is reported here. Moreover, the four benchmark problems with different degree of difficulty and variety are considered to address the important issues of groundwater resources in coastal regions. Hence, the wide ranges of popular objective functions and constraints with the number of decision variables ranging from 4 to 15 are included. These benchmark problems are applied in the combined simulation-optimization model to examine the optimization scenarios. Some preliminary experiments are performed to select the most efficient parameters values for EAs to set a fair comparison. The specific capabilities of each EA toward CGMPs in terms of results quality and required computational time are compared. The evaluation of the results highlights EA's applicability in CGMPs, besides the remarkable strengths and weaknesses of them. The comparisons show that SCE, CACO, and PSO yield superior solutions among the EAs according to the quality of solutions whereas ABC presents the poor performance. CACO provides the better solutions (up to 17%) than the worst EA (ABC) for the problem with the highest decision variables and more complexity. In terms of computational time, PSO and SIMPSA are the fastest. SCE needs the highest computational time, even up to four times in comparison to the fastest EAs. CACO and PSO can be recommended for application in CGMPs, in terms of both abovementioned criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Decision models are essential tools for coastal groundwater management (CGM). A combined simulation-optimization framework is employed to develop these models. One of the main barriers in the widespread application of these models for real-world cases is their large computational burden. Recent advances in efficient computational approaches and robust optimization methods can crack this barrier. This study surveys the scientific basis of CGM to provide an overview on this subject and reviews the-state-of-the-art to clarify recent developments and to outline ideas for improving the computational performance. Key details are presented on the performance and choice of possible robust tools such as efficient evolutionary algorithms (EAs), surrogate models, and parallel processing techniques. Then, the potential challenges remaining in this context are scrutinized, demonstrating open fields for further research, which include issues related to advances in simulating and optimizing phases such as introducing new robust algorithms and considering multi-objective purposes, implementing novel and high-performance tools, considering global concerns (e.g. climate change impacts), enhancing the existing models to fit the real world, and taking into account the complexities of real-world applications (e.g. uncertainties in the modeling parameters, and data acquisition). Finally, the outcomes of the systematic review are applied to solve a real-world CGM problem in Iran, to quantitatively examine the performance of combined implementation of some of the suggested tools. It is revealed that the required computational time is considerably reduced by as much as three orders of magnitude when correct combinations of robust EAs, surrogate model, and parallelization technique are utilized.

AB  - The Egyptian government is preparing a sustainable development master plan for the Ras Muhammed National Park (RMNP), south Sinai. Noteworthy, the scarcity of the freshwater resources and close proximity to the active seismic zones of the Gulf of Aqaba implicate geophysical investigations for the fresh groundwater aquifers and construct a design response spectrum, respectively. Accordingly, 14 VESs, hydro/engineering geophysical analysis, pumping tests, downhole seismic test, a design response spectrum for buildings, and borehole data were carried out in the study area. The unconfined freshwater aquifer was effectively depicted with true resistivities, thickness, and EC ranged from 56 to 135 a"broken vertical bar m, 11 to 112 m, and 1.4 to 7.1 mS/m, respectively. The Northeastern part was characterized by higher aquifer potentiality, where coarser grains size, highest thickness (112 m), high true resistivity (135 a"broken vertical bar m), groundwater flow (0.074 m(3)/day), tortuosity (1.293-1.312), formation resistivity factor (4.1-4.6), and storativity (0.281-0.276). An increase in pumping rate was accompanied by an increase in well loss, increase in aquifer losses, decrease in well specific capacity, and decrease in well efficiency. Design response spectrum prognosticated the short buildings (< 7 floors) in RMNP to be suffering from a high peak horizontal acceleration and shear forces for acceleration between 0.25 and 0.35 g. Therefore, appropriate detailing of shear reinforcement is indispensable to reduce the risk of structural damages at RMNP.

AB  - Stable isotopic ratios of water (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and major dissolved ions were analyzed from samples collected from the area south of the Ismailia canal, Egypt. This region has recently experienced rapid growth that has increased both surface and groundwater use. The data from the samples were used to identify recharge sources, and mixing and salinization processes in the groundwater system in this region. On the basis of the isotopic data and geochemical data, four end-members were defined representing, groundwater in a Quaternary aquifer, groundwater in a Miocene aquifer, water in the Ismailia canal, and wastewater from the 10th of Ramadan city. Several different mixing trends were recognized in the study area. As a consequence of mixing with groundwater in the Miocene aquifer, groundwater in the Quaternary aquifer was found to have depleted isotopic signatures and increased total dissolved ions (TDI) toward the south of the study area, near subsurface Miocene structural highs. Another mixing trend, consisting of, enriched isotopic ratios and lower TDI values toward the north in the Quaternary aquifer, indicated mixing with surface water, i.e., the Ismailia canal and freshwater ponds. A third trend of locally high TDI values together with depleted stable isotopic data, i.e., the Ramsis area and the vicinity of the well field, were interpreted to be due to excessive pumping for irrigation and reclamation activities, which in turn resulted in upconing of the deeper saline groundwater from the Miocene aquifer. Lastly, leakage from the wastewater ponds into the recharge process was suggested by considering chemical and isotopic signature of the Quaternary groundwater sample No. 31. These results strongly indicate the urgent need for monitoring, protection and remediation of the Quaternary aquifer in order to guarantee the sustainability of water resources in the study area. This work also illustrates the efficiency of using stable isotopes and major ion chemistry to improve our understanding of a flow system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a growing recognition among water resource managers that sustainable watershed management needs to not only account for the diverse ways humans benefit from the environment, but also incorporate the impact of human actions on the natural system. Coupled natural-human system modeling through explicit modeling of both natural and human behavior can help reveal the reciprocal interactions and co-evolution of the natural and human systems. This study develops a spatially scalable, generalized agent-based modeling (ABM) framework consisting of a process-based semi-distributed hydrologic model (SWAT) and a decentralized water system model to simulate the impacts of water resource management decisions that affect the food-water-energy-environment (FWEE) nexus at a watershed scale. Agents within a river basin are geographically delineated based on both political and watershed boundaries and represent key stakeholders of ecosystem services. Agents decide about the priority across three primary water uses: food production, hydropower generation and ecosystem health within their geographical domains. Agents interact with the environment (streamflow) through the SWAT model and interact with other agents through a parameter representing willingness to cooperate. The innovative two-way coupling between the water system model and SWAT enables this framework to fully explore the feedback of human decisions on the environmental dynamics and vice versa. To support non-technical stakeholder interactions, a web-based user interface has been developed that allows for role-play and participatory modeling. The generalized ABM framework is also tested in two key transboundary river basins, the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia and the Niger River basin in West Africa, where water uses for ecosystem health compete with growing human demands on food and energy resources. We present modeling results for crop production, energy generation and violation of eco-hydrological indicators at both the agent and basin-wide levels to shed light on holistic FWEE management policies in these two basins.

AB  - Groundwater is one of the most valuable natural resources in the world (Jha et al., 2007). However, it is not an unlimited resource; therefore understanding groundwater potential is crucial to ensure its sustainable use. The aim of the current study is to propose and verify new artificial intelligence methods for the spatial prediction of groundwater spring potential mapping at the Koohdasht-Nourabad plain, Lorestan province, Iran. These methods are new hybrids of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and five metaheuristic algorithms, namely invasive weed optimization (IWO), differential evolution (DE), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the bees algorithm (BA). A total of 2463 spring locations were identified and collected, and then divided randomly into two subsets: 70% (1725 locations) were used for training models and the remaining 30% (738 spring locations) were utilized for evaluating the models. A total of 13 groundwater conditioning factors were prepared for modeling, namely the slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), terrain roughness index (TRI), distance from fault, distance from river, land use/land cover, rainfall, soil order, and lithology. In the next step, the step-wise assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method was applied to quantify the degree of relevance of these groundwater conditioning factors. The global performance of these derived models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). In addition, the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were carried out to check and confirm the best model to use in this study. The result showed that all models have a high prediction performance; however, the ANFIS-DE model has the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.875), followed by the ANFIS-IWO model, the ANFIS-FA model (0.873), the ANFIS-PSO model (0.865), and the ANFIS-BA model (0.839). The results of this research can be useful for decision makers responsible for the sustainable management of groundwater resources.

AB  - We investigated submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-associated nutrient fluxes and budgets in two coastal embayments, Hwasun Bay and Bangdu Bay, off the volcanic island of Jeju, Korea. SGD in Hwasun Bay is a composite of marine and meteoric groundwater, while that in Bangdu Bay mainly includes marine groundwater. The submarine inputs of groundwater into Hwasun and Bangdu Bays were approximately 0.12 and 0.27 m(3) m(-2) d(-1), respectively, on the basis of the (222)Rn mass balance models. The nitrogen : phosphorus ratios in coastal groundwater (85 +/- 96) were considerably larger than those in the seawater (3.8 +/- 1.6) of both bays. Fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) through SGD were more than 90% of the net DIN input into both bays; approximately 93% and 39% of SGD-driven DIN was consumed inside Hwasun and Bangdu Bays, respectively. The discharge of DIN through SGD from the entire island was approximately 2.1 x 10(9) mol yr(-1), which is equivalent to that of some large rivers, potentially supporting approximately 1.6 x 10(11) g carbon yr(-1) of new primary production. Because Jeju accounts for less than 1% of the total land mass of the volcanic islands, SGD-driven nutrient fluxes from highly permeable islands standing in oligotrophic oceans could be very important for global nutrient budgets.

AB  - We measured seepage rates of coastal groundwater from a volcanic island, standing in the South Sea of Korea. The seepage rates measured along the sandy coast were in the range 50-300 m/yr, which are much higher than those reported from typical continental coast. The O-18 tracer in potential seeping waters signifies that they are mixtures of basal groundwater and pristine seawaters. On the eastern coast of Jeju, almost all groundwater discharge is attributed to recirculating seawater, while fresh groundwater contributes about 20% of the total submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) on the western coast of Jeju. Thus, SGD appears to be important for the management of water resources in western Jeju. The measured radionuclides (Ra-228, Ra-226, and Rn-222) and nutrients in the groundwater suggest that the discharge of both fresh and recirculated seawater will have a significant influence on the budget of coastal nutrients and other chemical constituents in this region.

AB  - To evaluate the role of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as a source of rare earth elements (REEs) in the coastal ocean, we estimated the SGD associated discharge of REEs into two semi-enclosed coastal bays off a volcanic island, Jeju, Korea. The coastal brackish groundwater showed pronounced enrichments of middle REEs (MREE) relative to light REEs (LREE) and heavy REEs (HREE) when normalized against the upper continental crust (UCC), whereas seawater samples outside the bays showed a HREE enrichment pattern. The enrichment of both MREE and HREE was clearly identified in bay waters, resulting from mixing between groundwater and offshore seawater. The mass balances of REEs demonstrated that the REE fluxes through SGD were two to three orders of magnitude higher than those that occurred through the other sources, such as diffusion from bottom sediments and atmospheric dust fallout. The SGD-driven Nd flux from the entire Jeju Island during this summer was approximately 120 +/- 60 mol d(-1), which is comparable to the Nd fluxes from major rivers (i.e., Mississippi River). Our results imply that highly permeable oceanic islands are particularly important for REE fluxes to the ocean. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concentrations of both the total dissolved (<0.45 mu m) and colloidal (10 kDa-0.45 mu m) phases of trace elements and rare earth elements (REEs) in coastal groundwater were measured to evaluate the role of colloids in transporting trace elements and REEs to the ocean through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Samples were collected from two different hydrogeological conditions, Hampyeong Bay in the southwestern coast of Korea and Jeju Island, Korea. The average colloidal proportions of Al, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb, Po-210, and Pb-210 were 35-45% of the total dissolved phase, which were relatively higher than those of Cr, Fe, Co, and REEs (10-30%), although hydrogeological conditions were variable. Most of the colloidal trace elements (including 210Pb and REEs), except Mn, correlate most significantly with Fe, indicating that their presence is dependent on Fe-containing oxide minerals in the subterranean estuary (STE). On the other hand, the colloidal Mn and 210Po correlated more significantly with dissolved organic carbon (DOC), indicating that dissolved organic matter (DOM) cycling associated with bacterial activity plays an important role in their presence in the colloidal phase in the STE. Our results suggest that the fluxes of trace elements through SGD are greatly dependent on the presence of Fe (for Al, Zn, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb, and REEs) and DOM (for Po-210 and Mn) in coastal groundwater. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Because groundwater is an essential resource for people and ecosystems, a better understanding is needed of the fundamental controls on recharge and its interactions with vegetation change. We analyzed >600 estimates of groundwater recharge to obtain the first global analysis of recharge and vegetation types. Globally, croplands had the highest proportion of water input (WI = precipitation + irrigation) that become recharge, followed by grasslands, woodlands, and scrublands (average proportional recharge: 0.11, 0.08, 0.06, and 0.05, respectively; P < 0.0001). A stepwise regression model revealed that WI had the strongest association with recharge overall, followed by vegetation type, potential evapotranspiration (PET), saturated hydraulic conductivity based on soil texture (K-s), and seasonality of rainfall (R-2 = 0.29, 0.16, 0.12, 0.06, and 0.01, respectively; P < 0.0001). Recharge increased with increasing WI, K-s, and seasonality of rainfall and decreased with increasing PET. Relative differences in recharge among vegetation types were larger in drier climates and clayey soils, indicating greater biological control on soil water fluxes under these conditions. To further test the relationship between recharge and vegetation, we compared global synthesis data to our parallel field estimates of recharge in paired grasslands, croplands, and woodlands across the Argentinean Pampas and the southwestern United States. Our field estimates of recharge were similar to, and followed the same pattern of, recharge under vegetation types in the synthesis data, suggesting that land-use changes will continue to alter recharge dynamics and vadose zone processes globally. The results of this study highlight the implications of land-use management for sustainable groundwater use and should also help test and improve recharge estimates in large-scale water balance and climate models.

AB  - We conducted various field studies at the seawater intrusion monitoring wells located in the eastern part of Jeju Island, Korea, to observe the tidal effect on groundwater-seawater flow in the coastal aquifer. Studies included monitoring the fluctuations of groundwater and tide levels, electrical and temperature logging, and 2-D heat-pulse flowmeter tests. According to time-series analysis, tidal effects on groundwater level reached up to 3 km inland from the coastline. Water-level variation was more sensitive to tidal fluctuations near the coast, and more related to rainfall toward inland areas. Temporal and spatial variations in the shape and location of the freshwater-saltwater interface were analyzed using data from nine monitoring wells. The results indicated that the interface toe is located at a distance of 6-8 km from the coastline and its location was related to geological layers present. Long-term seasonal variations revealed no major changes in the interface; minor variations were due to moving boundary conditions induced by tidal fluctuations. Using the two-dimensional heat-pulse flowmeter, groundwater flow directions and velocities at four tidal stages were measured on three monitoring wells drilled into the multilayered aquifers. This direct measurement enabled us to relate the differences of flow velocities and directions with geology and tidal fluctuations. Combining the results of EC logging and flowmeter tests, we found a zone where freshwater and saltwater moved alternately in opposite directions, as influenced by the tidal fluctuations. Integrating various physical togging and flowmeter data with water-Level fluctuations improved our understanding of the behavior of fresh and seawater flow in the coastal aquifers.

AB  - This paper suggests a new approach for integrating the quasi-distributed watershed model, SWAT, with the fully-distributed ground-water model, MODFLOW. Since the SWAT model has semi-distributed features, its groundwater component does not consider distributed parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient. In generating a detailed representation of groundwater recharge, it is equally difficult to calculate the head distribution and the distributed pumping rate. In order to solve this problem a method is proposed whereby the characteristics of the hydrologic response units (HRUs) in the SWAT model. are exchanged with cells in the MODFLOW model. By using this HRU-cell conversion interface, the distributed groundwater recharge rate and the groundwater evapotranspiration can be effectively simulated. By considering the interaction between the stream network and the aquifer to reflect boundary flow, the linkage is completed. For this purpose, the RIVER package in the MODFLOW mode(is used for river-aquifer interaction. This combined modeling is applied to the Musimcheon Basin in Korea. The application demonstrates that an integrated SWAT-MODFLOW is capable of simulating a spatio-temporal distribution of groundwater recharge rates, aquifer evapotranspiration and groundwater levels. It also enables an interaction between the saturated aquifer and channel reaches. This interaction played an important role in the generation of groundwater discharge in the basin, especially during the tow flow period. The advanced water transfer method in SWAT-MODFLOW was successfully tested, and reproduced the distributed drawdown and reduced stream flow by pumping with multiple wells. Therefore, when considering discharge to streams, springs or marshes, the use of this model would be beneficial in planning for the sustainable development of groundwater. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We observed the origin, behavior, and flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the subterranean estuary of a volcanic island, Jeju, Korea. The sampling of surface seawater and coastal groundwater was conducted in Hwasun Bay, Jeju, in three sampling campaigns (October 2010, January 2011, and June 2011). We observed conservative mixing of these components in this subterranean environment for a salinity range from 0 to 32. The fresh groundwater was characterized by relatively high DON, DIN, and CDOM, while the marine groundwater showed relatively high DOC. The DON and DIN fluxes through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in the groundwater of Hwasun Bay were estimated to be 1.3 x 10(5) and 2.9 x 10(5) mol d(-1), respectively. In the seawater of Hwasun Bay, the groundwater-origin DON was almost conservative while about 91% of the groundwater-origin DIN was removed perhaps due to biological production. The DON flux from the entire Jeju was estimated to be 7.9 x 10(8) mol yr(-1), which is comparable to some of the world's large rivers. Thus, our study highlights that DON flux through SGD is potentially important for delivery of organic nitrogen to further offshore while DIN is readily utilized by marine plankton in near-shore waters under N-limited conditions.

AB  - In order to identify the origin of saline groundwater in the eastern part of Jeju volcanic island, Korea, a hydrogeochemical and isotopic study has been carried out for 18 observation wells located in east and southeast coastal regions. The total dissolved solid contents of groundwaters are highly variable (77-21,782 mg/l). Oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and strontium isotopic data clearly show that the saline water results from mixing of groundwater with seawater. Strontium isotopic compositions and Br/Cl and I/Cl ratios strongly suggest that the source of salinity is modem seawater intrusion. Hydrogeochemical characteristics based on bivariate diagrams of major and minor ions show that changes in the chemical composition of groundwater are mainly controlled by the salinization process followed by cation-exchange reactions. The highly permeable aquifers at the east coastal region are characterized by low hydraulic gradient and discharge rate and high hydraulic conductivity as compared with other regions. These properties enhance the salinization of groundwater observed in the study area. Based on the Cl, Br, and delta(18)O data, seawater was determined to have intruded inland some 2.5 km from the coastline. Considering the poor correlation of sampling depth and Cl concentrations observed, the position of seawater-freshwater interface is not uniformly distributed in the study area, due to heterogeneities of the basaltic aquifers.

AB  - Scientific insights have revealed the existence of undersea freshwater aquifers off the coasts of some African States and elsewhere, which present possibilities for exploitation. The question arises as to whether, or to what extent, the formal governance structures of the African Union (Au) and its relevant maritime strategic frameworks adequately provide for their regulatory oversight. The study highlights relevant provisions of the Constitutive Act of the African Union and its related protocols, as well as the 2050 Africa's Integrated Maritime Strategy While the AU could facilitate the development of pan-African governing arrangements, important legal issues remain outstanding in relation to the applicable judicial mechanism, operationalizing agreed courses of action, facilitating access to technology, implementing appropriate environmental safeguards and clarifying landlocked States' rights. Suggestions are also made for further study. Addressing these issues could greatly facilitate efforts to design and optimise governing arrangements for the benefit of future generations.

AB  - An understanding of hydrological processes is vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources, especially in areas where an aquifer interacts with surface water systems or where aquifer interconnectivity occurs. This is particularly important in areas that are subjected to frequent drought/flood cycles, such as the Cressbrook Creek catchment in Southeast Queensland, Australia. In order to understand the hydrological response to flooding and to identify inter-aquifer connectivity, multiple isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18, Sr-87/Sr-86, H-3 and C-14) were used in this study in conjunction with a comprehensive hydrochemical assessment, based on data collected 6 months after severe flooding in 2011. The relatively depleted stable isotope signatures of the flood-generating rainfall (delta H-2: -30.2 to -27.8 parts per thousand, delta O-18: -5.34 to 5.13 parts per thousand VSMOW) were evident in surface water samples (delta H-2: -25.2 to -23.2 parts per thousand, delta O-18: -3.9 to -3.6 parts per thousand VSMOW), indicating that these extreme events were a major source of recharge to the dam in the catchment headwaters. Furthermore, stable isotopes confirmed that the flood generated significant recharge to the alluvium in the lower part of the catchment, particularly in areas where interactions between surface waters and groundwater were identified and where diffuse aquifer recharge is normally limited by a thick (approximately 10 m) and relatively impermeable unsaturated zone. However, in the upper parts of the catchment where recharge generally occurs more rapidly due to the dominance of coarse-grained sediments in the unsaturated zone, the stable isotope signature of groundwater resembles the longer-term average rainfall values (delta H-2: -12.6, delta O-18: -3.4 parts per thousand VSMOW), highlighting that recharge was sourced from smaller rainfall events that occurred subsequent to the flooding. Interactions between the bedrock aquifers and the alluvium were identified at several sites in the lower part of the catchment based on Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios; this was also supported by the hydrochemical assessment, which included the modelling of evaporation trends and saturation indices. The integrated approach used in this study facilitated the identification of hydrological processes over different spatial and temporal scales, and the method can be applied to other complex geological settings with variable climatic conditions.

AB  - A catchment-scale multivariate statistical analysis of hydrochemistry enabled assessment of interactions between alluvial groundwater and Cressbrook Creek, an intermittent drainage system in southeast Queensland, Australia. Hierarchical cluster analyses and principal component analysis were applied to time-series data to evaluate the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater during periods of extreme drought and severe flooding. A simple three-dimensional geological model was developed to conceptualise the catchment morphology and the stratigraphic framework of the alluvium. The alluvium forms a two-layer system with a basal coarse-grained layer overlain by a clay-rich low-permeability unit. In the upper and middle catchment, alluvial groundwater is chemically similar to streamwater, particularly near the creek (reflected by high HCO3/Cl and K/Na ratios and low salinities), indicating a high degree of connectivity. In the lower catchment, groundwater is more saline with lower HCO3/Cl and K/Na ratios, notably during dry periods. Groundwater salinity substantially decreased following severe flooding in 2011, notably in the lower catchment, confirming that flooding is an important mechanism for both recharge and maintaining groundwater quality. The integrated approach used in this study enabled effective interpretation of hydrological processes and can be applied to a variety of hydrological settings to synthesise and evaluate large hydrochemical datasets.

AB  - The Mekong River Basin is a key regional resource in Southeast Asia for sectors that include agriculture, fisheries and electricity production. Here we explore the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater resources within the river basin. We quantify uncertainty in these projections associated with GCM structure and climate sensitivity, as well as from hydrological model parameter specification. This is achieved by running pattern-scaled GCM scenarios through a semi-distributed hydrological model (SLURP) of the basin. Pattern-scaling allows investigation of specific thresholds of global climate change including the postulated 2 degrees C threshold of "dangerous" climate change. Impacts of a 2 degrees C rise in global mean temperature are investigated using seven different GCMs, providing an implicit analysis of uncertainty associated with GCM structure. Analysis of progressive changes in global mean temperature from 0.5 to 6 degrees C above the 1961-1990 baseline (using the HadCM3 GCM) reveals a relatively small but non-linear response of annual river discharge to increasing global mean temperature, ranging from a 5.4% decrease to 4.5% increase. Changes in mean monthly river discharge are greater (from -16% to +55%, with greatest decreases in July and August, greatest increases in May and June) and result from complex and contrasting intra-basin changes in precipitation, evaporation and snow storage/melt. Whilst overall results are highly GCM dependent (in both direction and magnitude), this uncertainty is primarily driven by differences in GCM projections of future precipitation. In contrast, there is strong consistency between GCMs in terms of both increased potential evapotranspiration and a shift to an earlier and less substantial snowmelt season. Indeed, in the upper Mekong (Lancang sub-basin), the temperature-related signal in discharge is strong enough to overwhelm the precipitation-related uncertainty in the direction of change in discharge, with scenarios from all GCMs leading to increased river flow from April-June and decreased flow from July-August.

AB  - There is increasing concern over falling groundwater levels in some areas of Bangladesh, and there is undoubted overuse of groundwater in the Barind Tract in northwest Bangladesh and around Dhaka. However, the volumes of water availability and use, and hence the sustainability of use, are not well known. We developed monthly water balances for the main regions of Bangladesh to investigate historic trends in water use and availability and possible future trends under changed management to lessen groundwater use by using more surface water for irrigation. Our results show that for many areas the fall in pre-monsoon groundwater levels (at the regional average level) over the last few decades may be largely explained by the continual withdrawal of ever greater volumes of water with the three-fold increase in the area of irrigation. Thus, for many areas, if there were no further increase in the area irrigated by groundwater, the rate of decline in groundwater levels would likely reduce and levels could even attain a new equilibrium at a lower level, implying that current pumping rates could be maintained (subject to the lower groundwater levels being acceptable on environmental, economic and social grounds). Post-monsoon grodndwater levels are largely influenced by yearly rainfall variability. Thus, groundwater use in some areas may not be as unsustainable as feared, and policies to reduce groundwater use in such areas may not be as necessary or urgent as thought. However, our analysis is approximate and detailed local studies are required to assess the sustainability of use. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Roof-harvested rainwater (RHRW) is an important alternative source of water that many island communities can use for drinking and other domestic purposes when ground-water and/or surface water sources are contaminated, limited, or simply not available. The aim of this pilot-scale study was to investigate current RHRW practices in American Samoa (AS) and to evaluate and compare the quality of water from common potable water sources including RHRW stored in tanks, untreated stream water, untreated municipal well water, and treated municipal tap water samples. Samples were analyzed using culture-based methods, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and 16S amplicon sequencing-based methods. Based on indicator bacteria (total coliform and Escherichia coli) concentrations, the quality of RHRW was slightly lower than well and chlorinated tap water but exceeded that of untreated stream water. Although no Giardia or Leptospira spp. were detected in any of the RHRW samples, 86% of the samples were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. All stream water samples tested positive for Cryptosporidium spp. Opportunistic pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium intracellulare) were also detected in the RHRW samples (71 and 21% positive samples, respectively). Several potentially pathogenic genera of bacteria were also detected in RHRW by amplicon sequencing. Each RHRW system was characterized by distinct microbial communities, 77% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected only in a single tank, and no OTU was shared by all the tanks. Risk of water-borne illness increased in the following order: chlorinated tap water/well water < RHRW< stream water. Frequent detection of opportunistic pathogens indicates that RHRW should be treated before use. Stakeholder education on RHRW system design options as well as on importance of regular cleaning and proper management techniques could improve the quality of the RHRWin AS.

AB  - Jordan faces an archetypal combination of high water scarcity, with a per capita water availability of around 150 m(3) per year significantly below the absolute scarcity threshold of 500 m(3), and strong population growth, especially due to the Syrian refugee crisis. A transition to more sustainable water consumption patterns will likely require Jordan's water authorities to rely more strongly on water demand management in the future. We conduct a case study of the effects of pricing policies, using an agent-based model of household water consumption in Jordan's capital Amman, in order to analyze the distribution of burdens imposed by demand-side policies across society. Amman's households face highly intermittent piped water supply, leading them to supplement it with water from storage tanks and informal private tanker operators. Using a detailed data set of the distribution of supply durations across Amman, our model can derive the demand for additional tanker water. We find that integrating these different supply sources into our model causes demand-side policies to have strongly heterogeneous effects across districts and income groups. This highlights the importance of a disaggregated perspective on water policy impacts in order to identify and potentially mitigate excessive burdens.

AB  - Aquifers and groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are facing increasing pressure from water consumption, irrigation and climate change. These pressures modify groundwater levels and their temporal patterns and threaten vital ecosystem services such as arable land irrigation and ecosystem water requirements, especially during droughts. This review examines climate change effects on groundwater and dependent ecosystems. The mechanisms affecting natural variability in the global climate and the consequences of climate and land use changes due to anthropogenic influences are summarised based on studies from different hydrogeological strata and climate zones. The impacts on ecosystems are discussed based on current findings on factors influencing the biodiversity and functioning of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The influence of changes to groundwater on GDE biodiversity and future threats posed by climate change is reviewed, using information mainly from surface water studies and knowledge of aquifer and groundwater ecosystems. Several gaps in research are identified. Due to lack of understanding of several key processes, the uncertainty associated with management techniques such as numerical modelling is high. The possibilities and roles of new methodologies such as indicators and modelling methods are discussed in the context of integrated groundwater resources management. Examples are provided of management impacts on groundwater, with recommendations on sustainable management of groundwater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater contained within the submarine extensions of coastal aquifers is increasingly proposed as a freshwater source for coastal communities. However, the extent to which offshore freshwater supports onshore pumping is currently unknown on a global scale. This study provides the first attempt to examine the likely prevalence of situations where offshore freshwater influences onshore salinities, considering various sites from around the world. The groundwater conditions in twenty-seven confined and semi confined coastal aquifers with plausible connections to inferred or observed offshore freshwater are explored. The investigation uses available onshore salinities and groundwater levels, and offshore salinity knowledge, in combination with analytical modelling, to develop simplified conceptual models of the study sites. Seven different conceptual models are proposed based on the freshwater-saltwater extent and insights gained from analytical modelling. We consider both present-day and pre-development conditions in assessing potential modern contributions to offshore fresh groundwater. Conceptual models also include interpretations of whether offshore freshwater is a significant factor influencing onshore salinities and well pumping sustainability. The results indicate that onshore water levels have declined between pre-development and present-day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions for which pre-development data are available. Estimates of the associated steady-state freshwater extents show the potential for considerable offshore fresh groundwater losses accompanying these declines. Both present-day and pre-development heads are insufficient to account for the observed offshore freshwater in all cases where adequate data exist. This suggests that paleo-freshwater and/or aquifer heterogeneities contribute significantly to offshore freshwater extent. Present-day heads indicate that active seawater intrusion (SWI) will eventually impact onshore pumping wells at fourteen of the twenty-seven sites, while passive SWI is expected onshore in an additional ten regions. Albeit the number of field sites is limited, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that when offshore freshwater has an onshore linkage, it is being mined either passively or actively by onshore use. Thus, offshore freshwater should be assessed in coastal water balances presuming that it serves as an existing freshwater input, rather than as a new potential freshwater resource.

AB  - Long-term population growth and economic development are placing ever-increasing pressure on South Africa's freshwater supply. On the basis of the current climate change predictions, which often entail uncertain consequences for aquifer systems and the associated groundwater goods and services, it is expected that the stress on water will increase even further. Currently, South Africa's groundwater governance regime does not provide the capacity to assure effective and sustainable resource regulation and allocation. To date, the management of groundwater is hampered by a variety of uncertainties, such as global climate change and socio-economic growth, as well as ineffective governance structures affecting resource use, regulation, protection and the implementation of alternative strategies needed to achieve sustainable management. This paper presents the results of a qualitative assessment of interviews conducted with experts in South Africa. Four key challenges are identified to the development of adaptive and sustainable groundwater management and the successful implementation of current water legislation in South Africa. These are: the undervaluation of groundwater importance and significance; the need for expertise and information at all scales; the centralisation of power; and the disregard of ecosystems and the associated goods and services. As a means to tackle these challenges, it has been assumed that the concept of adaptive water management represents a suitable approach to governing groundwater resources, by taking into account complex system linkages between hydrogeological, political, socio-economic and environmental domains. Supporting principles, such as tools for cooperation, participation and information networks, have been developed to facilitate the implementation of adaptive water management approaches and hence to achieve institutional change in the political arena of groundwater management.

AB  - The competing demands placed on groundwater for socio-economic and for ecological benefits, and the resultant tradeoffs, represent a major challenge for the management arena. The governance of groundwater resources and the sustainable management of associated ecosystem services must take into consideration human and biophysical characteristics as intertwined systems. Frameworks and analytical tools are required to help understand complex governance regimes, and the linkages between management and the corresponding effects on ecosystem services. Presented in this paper is a framework for the analysis of groundwater governance based on the adaptive management approach and the ecosystem services concept. Governance can be analyzed on the basis of certain characteristics. One characteristic of a governance regime assumed to be crucial for adaptive and sustainable management is vertical integration, which refers to the connectedness of different administrative levels, including the involvement of non-governmental stakeholders in decision-making and planning processes. The framework was applied in the Upper Guadiana Basin in Spain, where the intensive use of groundwater has led to significant conflicts between farmers, authorities and environmental conservation groups. The analysis showed that conflicts arose from a lack of vertical integration; e.g., one-way communication between official authorities and the exclusion of local stakeholders during planning processes. The framework is deemed to be a strong analytical tool as it provides a basis for organized and context-specific case study assessment and renders complex groundwater management more transparent and comprehensible. The framework will be further applied and enhanced for application in international case studies.

AB  - The over-abstraction of aquifers and the modification of landscape-water systems often result in the degradation of groundwater resources and the loss of related ecosystem services. Many of these problems are associated with failure of governance and management regimes. Thus, groundwater resources require innovative approaches that deal with system complexity moving governments toward adaptive and integrated management. Vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (cross-sectoral) integration structures are crucial characteristics of adaptive governance and support sustainable management of groundwater ecosystem services. The research objective of this article is to investigate linkages between these integration structures, the governance regime and the state of groundwater ecosystem services across three case studies: Sandveld (South Africa), Upper Guadiana (Spain) and Spree (Germany). First, we developed a set of criteria indicating vertical and horizontal integration and then applied a conceptual and analytical approach, the Management and Transition Framework, specifically developed to support a systematic and consistent investigation of policy and management processes. Results indicate that higher degrees of integration during management activities do not identify a direct improvement of groundwater ecosystem services. But evidence highlights that integration (1) opens up the political arena for environmental perspectives, (2) increases the quality of groundwater and conservation plans, (3) accelerates the implementation of policies, (4) mitigates conflicts between different groundwater users and (5) increases the awareness of different ecosystem services. Finally, we conclude that compared with other natural resources, groundwater management still lacks participation, multi-level interactions and sectoral integration, especially at higher levels of management.

AB  - Groundwater-dependent ecosystem services provide benefits to human well-being and play a key role in regulating ecosystem processes and functions. Improving groundwater management is of fundamental importance to reduce ecological trade-offs and to avoid long-term negative consequences for societies. In this context, local groundwater policies as well as multi-level governance processes play a key role. This article provides an improved understanding of how local policies change in response to social-ecological drivers and how these changes contribute to the sustainable provision of groundwater-dependent ecosystem services. Within this context, we analyze recent changes in local groundwater policies in the Sandveld region (South Africa) and the Spreewald region (Germany) from a multi-level governance perspective. In both cases a combination of drivers - in particular ecological degradation experienced at the local level and socio-political transformation - led to changes of local groundwater policies. A positive impact of these changes is expected, but not yet visible. The studied policies consider the complexity of groundwater functions and the different users depending on them. However, they do not explicitly mention ecosystem services and ignore important ecological processes and functions. Therefore, we conclude that groundwater management could become more sustainable by taking ecosystem services and stakeholder interests more explicitly into account in local policy processes.

AB  - The quality of near-surface groundwater reservoirs is controlled, but also threatened, by manifold surface-subsurface interactions. Vulnerability studies typically evaluate the variable interplay of surface factors (land management, infiltration patterns) and subsurface factors (hydrostratigraphy, flow properties) in a thorough way, but disregard the resulting groundwater quality. Conversely, hydrogeochemical case studies that address the chemical evolution of groundwater often lack a comprehensive analysis of the structural buildup. In this study, we aim to reconstruct the actual spatial groundwater quality pattern from a synoptic analysis of the hydrostratigraphy, lithostratigraphy, pedology and land use in the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory (Hainich CZE). This CZE represents a widely distributed yet scarcely described setting of thin-bedded mixed carbonatesiliciclastic strata in hillslope terrains. At the eastern Hainich low-mountain hillslope, bedrock is mainly formed by alternated marine sedimentary rocks of the Upper Muschelkalk (Middle Triassic) that partly host productive groundwater resources. Spatial patterns of the groundwater quality of a 5.4 km long well transect are derived by principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. Aquifer stratigraphy and geostructural links were deduced from lithological drill core analysis, mineralogical analysis, geophysical borehole logs and mapping data. Maps of preferential recharge zones and recharge potential were deduced from digital (soil) mapping, soil survey data and field measurements of soil hydraulic conductivities (K-s). By attributing spatially variable surface and subsurface conditions, we were able to reconstruct groundwater quality clusters that reflect the type of land management in their preferential recharge areas, aquifer hydraulic conditions and cross-formational exchange via caprock sinkholes or ascending flow. Generally, the aquifer configuration (spatial arrangement of strata, valley incision/outcrops) and related geostructural links (enhanced recharge areas, karst phenomena) control the role of surface factors (input quality and locations) vs. subsurface factors (water-rock interaction, cross-formational flow) for groundwater quality in the multi-layered aquifer system. Our investigation reveals general properties of alternating sequences in hillslope terrains that are prone to forming multilayered aquifer systems. This synoptic analysis is fundamental and indispensable for a mechanistic understanding of ecological functioning, sustainable resource management and protection.

AB  - A natural consequence of groundwater withdrawals is the removal of water from subsurface storage, but the overall rates and magnitude of groundwater depletion and capture relative to groundwater withdrawals (extraction or pumpage) have not previously been well characterized. This study assesses the partitioning of long-term cumulative withdrawal volumes into fractions derived from storage depletion and capture, where capture includes both increases in recharge and decreases in discharge. Numerical simulation of a hypothetical groundwater basin is used to further illustrate some of Theis' (1940) principles, particularly when capture is constrained by insufficient available water. Most prior studies of depletion and capture have assumed that capture is unconstrained through boundary conditions that yield linear responses. Examination of real systems indicates that capture and depletion fractions are highly variable in time and space. For a large sample of long-developed groundwater systems, the depletion fraction averages about 0.15 and the capture fraction averages about 0.85 based on cumulative volumes. Higher depletion fractions tend to occur in more arid regions, but the variation is high and the correlation coefficient between average annual precipitation and depletion fraction for individual systems is only 0.40. Because 85% of long-term pumpage is derived from capture in these real systems, capture must be recognized as a critical factor in assessing water budgets, groundwater storage depletion, and sustainability of groundwater development. Most capture translates into streamflow depletion, so it can detrimentally impact ecosystems.

AB  - Pumping optimization of coastal aquifers involves complex numerical models. In problems with many decision variables, the computational burden for reaching the optimal solution can be excessive. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are flexible function approximators and have been used as surrogate models of complex numerical models in groundwater optimization. However, this approach is not practical in cases where the number of decision variables is large, because the required neural network structure can be very complex and difficult to train. The present study develops an optimization method based on modular neural networks, in which several small subnetwork modules, trained using a fast adaptive procedure, cooperate to solve a complex pumping optimization problem with many decision variables. The method utilizes the fact that salinity distribution in the aquifer, depends more on pumping from nearby wells rather than from distant ones. Each subnetwork predicts salinity in only one monitoring well, and is controlled by relatively few pumping wells falling within certain control distance from the monitoring well. While the initial control area is radial, its shape is aclaptively improved using a Hermite interpolation procedure. The modular neural subnetworks are trained adaptively during optimization, and it is possible to retrain only the ones not performing well. As optimization progresses, the subnetworks are adapted to maximize performance near the current search space of the optimization algorithm. The modular neural subnetwork models are combined with an efficient optimization algorithm and are applied to a real coastal aquifer in the Greek island of Santorini. The numerical code SEAWAT was selected for solving the partial differential equations of flow and density dependent transport. The decision variables correspond to pumping rates from 34 wells. The modular subnetwork implementation resulted in significant reduction in CPU time and identified an even better solution than the original numerical model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers is a major environmental problem and efficient tools are needed to assist decision making. Decision tools are often simulation models (which evaluate probable actions) combined with optimization algorithms (which search for optimum management decisions). A coupling between simulation models and optimization algorithms for management of coastal aquifers is presented. The simulation models are based on the sharp-interface approximation where the decision variables do not affect the discretized system matrix. For such problems, a transformation of the system matrix prior to optimization is proposed which supports rapid solution of the linear system of equations during the optimization stage, for different values of decision variables. The method is applied to a hypothetical simulation of a coastal aquifer on the Greek island of Santorini, where the proposed simulation-optimization coupling method is employed to maximize pumping rates subject to environmental constraints that protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion. Various packages were tested in order to investigate their efficiency in solving the linear system pertinent to the case study. The proposed method, based on coupling of equations, is found to be very efficient in terms of computational cost. In particular, for the problem examined, it is at least 50 times faster than standard methods, depending on the grid size.

AB  - The partition of surface ocean domains is a tool to assess its patterns and driving forces, ideally incorporating its dynamic nature. The area off Southwest Iberian Peninsula (SWIP), located between temperate and subtropical waters, includes oceanic and coastal domains affected by atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns, as well as coastal processes. The objectives of this study were to delineate a dynamic abiotic-based partition of the heterogeneous surface SWIP area into environmental provinces (EPs), evaluating their spatio-temporal distribution and abiotic properties, as well as the biological relevance of the partition. An unsupervised classification was based on nearly 10 years (2002-2011) of satellite-and model-derived data representative of physical, chemical and optical surface environments. Twelve EPs (two coastal, two slope and eight oceanic) presented areal coverage varying along the annual cycle with patterns significantly related to phytoplankton abundance and productivity. Highly significant intra-annual variability in province-specific area coverage and distinctions in the abiotic properties distinguished EPs predominant during cold (autumn-winter) and warm (spring-summer) periods. Areal coverage and abiotic properties of EPs predominant during the cold period presented higher variability in comparison to warm period EPs. During the warm period, the signature of coastal upwelling was evident, particularly over the western slope and coastal EPs. Riverine discharge was also a relevant local control of abiotic properties over coastal EPs. Overall, the spatio-temporal coverage patterns of EPs and abiotic and biotic properties showed a good agreement with previous studies of the SWIP area, particularly along the oceanic and slope sectors. The combination of a broad dataset, derived from products available through operational oceanography programs, and objective unsupervised data classification methods, represented a suitable strategy for characterizing SWIP ocean surface environment. Direct applications of this partition include its use as support for designing sampling strategies, ocean modelling, interpreting environmental and biological patterns, and ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Phytoplankton, the dominant marine primary producers, are considered to be highly sensitive indicators of ecosystem condition and change. The southwest area off the Iberian Peninsula (SWIP, NE Atlantic) is located in a biogeographical transition zone between temperate and subtropical waters, and classified as being very vulnerable to climate change. SWIP includes a variety of oceanic and coastal domains, under the influence of topographic irregularities, coastal upwelling and continental freshwater outflows, that collectively challenge the understanding of phytoplankton dynamics and controls. This study aimed to evaluate patterns in seasonal and interannual variability in phytoplankton and underlying environmental determinants within specific regions of SWIP, during a 15-year period (1997-2012), and to assess whether climate variability affects the regions in different ways. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of satellite-retrieved sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), acquired from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI), 4-Icm, 16-day resolution, was used to regionalize the study area. Region-specific Chl-a variability patterns and their linkages with environmental determinants were explored using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM). A set of local physical-chemical variables, derived from satellite and model data, and large-scale climate indices, were used as environmental variables. EOF analysis of Chl-a variability over the heterogeneous SWIP area identified nine coherent regions, with distinctive variability patterns (4 coastals, 2 slopes and 3 open-ocean regions). Region specific GAMM models explained between 32% and 82% of Chl-a variance, with higher explanatory power (>61%) for open ocean regions and coastal regions under increased riverine influence. Chl-a model predictors, as well as their effects, varied markedly among SWIP regions. However, climate-sensitive local environmental variables (sea surface temperature SST and photosynthetically available radiation) emerged as the most influential general predictors overall, and large-scale climate indices showed significant but minor effects. Over oceanic SWIP regions, Chl-a (0.08-1.50 pg L-1) showed a uni-modal annual cycle, with increases during the mixed layer deepening and late-winter maxima, reflecting seasonal changes in SST and ocean stratification, and probably related to increased nutrient availability and/or decreased mortality. Over coastal regions south of 37 N, Chl-a (0.23-10 pg L-1) also benefited from riverine discharges, mostly during winter, and upwelling induced by zonal westerly winds, stronger during summer. Over the Portuguese west coast region, Chl-a (0.26-2.20 pg L-1) showed a uni-modal annual cycle, with summer maxima, associated with the stimulatory effects of meridional northerly winds and coastal upwelling that partially extended into slope waters. Chl-a interannual variability showed zonal differences within SWIP, with significant interannual patterns only for regions south of 37 N. Nonetheless, contrasting trends were detected in coastal (decline) and oceanic (increase) regions, possibly a consequence of between-region differences in the relative roles of nutrient and light limitation, corresponding to significant interannual increases in wind speed and mixed layer depth. Our study used a biologically-relevant objective regionalization of a heterogeneous area, to elucidate phytoplankton dynamics and controls. The region -specific associations observed between phytoplankton and multiple climate-sensitive environmental drivers over the SWIP area reinforce the role of phytoplankton as a strategic element for evaluating ecosystem responses to climate variability and change.

AB  - This paper introduces a Special Issue of Hydrological Sciences Journal containing 10 research papers which present current applications of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for water resources assessment. First, an overview of selected, recently published papers with application of SWAT is given. The papers address the following topics: nutrients and related best management practices (BMPs); sediments and related BMPs; impoundment and wetlands; irrigation; bioenergy crops; climate change impact; and land-use change impacts. Then, papers from this Special Issue are briefly described, covering the themes: surface runoff and sediments; nonpoint-source pollution; surface water and groundwater; impacts of climate and land-use change; and large-scale SWAT applications. The presented model applications of SWAT were conducted across a variety of spatial scales, physiographic regions and climatic zones. This collection of papers demonstrates that applications of SWAT for water resources assessment are growing in number and cover drainage basins in many regions worldwide. [GRAPHICS] Editor M.

AB  - Negative environmental externalities typically emerge in rural areas due to urban centers' privileged access to the rural hinterland for economic activities related to the extraction and processing of natural resources. Less attention has been given to those cases when both the promotion of economic activities and their consequential inequalities are driven from within rural communities themselves. Privileged accounts within communities naturalize environmental concerns and divert attention from the inequalities associated with the costs and risks of economic development. Within this context, it is important to examine local perceptions, framings, and power structures that create and perpetuate asymmetries in access to natural resources for economic development and the local vulnerabilities they create. Drawing on Freudenberg's theory of privileged access and privileged accounts, this paper examines the promotion and development of biofuels plants in the rural American Midwest. Here, proponents of biofuels development argued that biofuel facilities were ideally suited to local conditions, where large-scale corn production, the main biomass input, is extensive. Drawing on data from surveys of six case study communities in rural Kansas and Iowa, augmented by in-depth stakeholder interviews, we discuss the local support towards biofuels production in the context of environmental concerns. The results indicate significant rural community support despite evidence that the contribution of biofuels production to local livelihoods was minimal. We show how these privileged accounts create largely unified support locally for biofuels production and quiescence concerning the disproportionality of benefits, potential environmental harms and long term development challenges.

AB  - Watershed development programmes provide an opportunity for sustainable management strategies, although currently, they remain largely 'supply-side' mechanisms of water resources development. Hydrogeological conditions, community participation and status of groundwater usage are important in evolving strategies on 'demand-side' groundwater management. Neemkheda aquifer is a typical low-storage, low-hydraulic conductivity aquifer from a watershed in the dryland regions of Madhya Pradesh State of central India. A shallow unconfined aquifer, it consists of an upper coarse, calcareous sandstone unit underlain by a fine-grained sandstone unit. A 'well commune' of seven wells is poised to test the concept of joint groundwater management, wherein wells are mechanisms of tapping a common water source, the Neemkheda aquifer. The strategy for systematic groundwater management in the Neemkheda well commune is based upon the relationship between Transmissivity (T) and Storage coefficient (S), i.e. aquifer diffusivity, and its variation within the aquifer. Wells within a high diffusivity domain tend to dewater more quickly than wells within a low diffusivity domain. A well-use schedule during the dry season, based upon aquifer diffusivity forms the basis of the groundwater management concept. The distribution of local aquifer diffusivities governs the relationship between local and regional aquifer depletion times and forms the basis of the groundwater management exercise being proposed for the Neemkheda aquifer.

AB  - India's farm sector sustains livelihoods for hundreds of millions of rural people, but faces serious management challenges for land, water, and energy resources. Growing dependence on groundwater threatens water resources sustainability and power sector viability. Sustaining India's rising prosperity rests on managing groundwater. This study shows that raising power tariffs in the farm sector to achieve efficiency and sustainability of groundwater use is both socially and economically viable. The question is about how to introduce this shift. This paper discusses five different options for power supply, metering and energy pricing in the farm sector and the expected outcomes of implementing each vis-a-vis efficiency of groundwater and energy use, equity in access and sustainability of groundwater. It concludes that establishing an energy quota for each farm-based on sustainability considerations, and metering and charging pro rata for power used are the best options to manage groundwater and the energy economy.

AB  - Population growth and rapid urbanization lead to considerable stress on already depleting water resources. A great challenge for water authorities of urban cities is to supply adequate and reliable safe water to all consumers. In most of the developing countries water scarcity and high demands have led the water authorities to resort to intermittent supplies. Surface and groundwater are the major sources of supply in urban cities. The direct consequences of intermittent supplies and poor sanitation practices are several incidences of water borne diseases posing public health risk. In order to minimize the supply-demand gap and to assure good quality of water, new techniques or models can be helpful to manage the water distribution systems (WDS) in a better way. In the present paper, a review is carried out on the existing urban water supply management methodologies with a way forward for the proper management of the water supply systems.

AB  - Increased demand of water in different sectors and restriction of water resources, necessitate the planning of groundwater recharge. In this study, groundwater potential zone are delineated by combining remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques in the Durg district, Chhattisgarh. Groundwater potential zones prepared using various thematic layers viz. geology, slope, land-use, lineament, drainage, soil, and rainfall. The thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights on the Saaty's scale according to their relative significance for ground water occurrence. The assigned weights of the layers and their features were normalized by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and eigenvector method finally; the selected thematic maps were integrated using weighted linear combination method to create the final ground water potential zone map. Each criterion/factor was assigned an appropriate weight based on Saaty's 9 point scale and the weights were normalized through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The process was integrated in the GIS environment to produce the groundwater potential prediction map of the study area. The groundwater potential map of the Durg district was found to be 75 % and 56 % accurate for seven and four factors respectively. The ground water potential zone map was finally validated using the groundwater depth data from 16 pumping wells respectively in the study area.

AB  - A holistic perspective on changing rainfall-driven flood risk is provided for the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Economic losses from floods have greatly increased, principally driven by the expanding exposure of assets at risk. It has not been possible to attribute rain-generated peak streamflow trends to anthropogenic climate change over the past several decades. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall, based on climate models, should contribute to increases in precipitation-generated local flooding (e.g. flash flooding and urban flooding). This article assesses the literature included in the IPCC SREX report and new literature published since, and includes an assessment of changes in flood risk in seven of the regions considered in the recent IPCC SREX report-Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Europe, North America, Oceania and Polar regions. Also considering newer publications, this article is consistent with the recent IPCC SREX assessment finding that the impacts of climate change on flood characteristics are highly sensitive to the detailed nature of those changes and that presently we have only low confidence(1) in numerical projections of changes in flood magnitude or frequency resulting from climate change.

AB  - Sustainable decisions in hydrological risk management require detailed information on the probability density function (pdf) of the model output. Only then probabilities for the failure of a specific management option or the exceedance of critical thresholds (e.g. of pollutants) can be derived. A new approach of uncertainty propagation in hydrological equations is developed that directly propagates the probability density functions of uncertain model input parameters into the corresponding probability density functions of model output. The basics of the methodology are presented and central applications to different disciplines in hydrology are shown. This work focuses on the following basic hydrological equations: (1) pumping test analysis (Theis-equation, propagation of uncertainties in recharge and transmissivity), (2) 1-dim groundwater contaminant transport equation (Gauss-equation, propagation of uncertainties in decay constant and dispersivity), (3) evapotranspiration estimation (Penman-Monteith-equation, propagation of uncertainty in roughness length). The direct propagation of probability densities is restricted to functions that are monotonically increasing or decreasing or that can be separated in corresponding monotonic branches so that inverse functions can be derived. In case no analytic solutions for inverse functions could be derived, semi-analytical approximations were used. It is shown that the results of direct probability density function propagation are in perfect agreement with results obtained from corresponding Monte Carlo derived frequency distributions. Direct pdf propagation, however, has the advantage that is yields exact solutions for the resulting hydrological pdfs rather than approximating discontinuous frequency distributions. It is additionally shown that the type of the resulting pdf depends on the specific values (order of magnitude, respectively) of the standard deviation of the input pdf. The dependency of skewness and kurtosis of the propagated pdf on the coefficient of variation of input parameter uncertainty is detected to be non-monotonic with distinctive maxima.

AB  - To reduce the uplift pressure of groundwater, many wells, deep into the Chingmei gravel stratum underneath Taipei city, were installed during construction of Taipei MRT underground stations. These wells can also be used to establish a circulating groundwater system for air-conditioning. To study the feasibility of this circulating cooling system and the thermal response of the Chingmei gravel stratum, some groundwater parameters of the Chingmai gravel stratum were studied such as pumping and recharging capacities, flow direction, and flow velocity etc. Two small scale in-situ discharge tests and numerical simulations were used for this purpose. However, the tests could not be performed for a long period to prove the purpose, the computer modeling provided the predicted long time response of the stratum. The discharge tests on the wells confirmed the discharge capacity of the Chingmei stratum and the numerical results also indicate that circulating groundwater with a steady temperature can be provided to cool down air-conditioners, as long as groundwater is flowing at a slow velocity. This study confirms the feasibility of using the groundwater of the Chingmei gravel stratum as a steady and clean cool source for air-conditioners. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This essay introduces a collection of articles that explore the future of groundwater-based agriculture in the Mediterranean from an interdisciplinary perspective, in a context of declining water tables due to intensive groundwater use. The imminent crisis that many groundwater economies face due to very rapid and intense global change may have severe irreversible social, economic and environmental consequences, but could also be the opportunity to make a clear break with current agricultural development models and move towards more sustainable agricultural practices. The Mediterranean region is, therefore, an interesting case for the future of intensive groundwater use, as innovative ideas and practices may emerge and inspire similar groundwater-based agricultural systems around the world.

AB  - We explore the influence of long-term, large-scale irrigational pumping on spatial and seasonal patterns of streamflow regimes in the High Plains aquifer using extensive observational data to elucidate the effects of regional-scale human alterations on the hydrological cycle. Streamflow, groundwater and precipitation time series spanning all or part of the period of intensive irrigation development (1940-1980) in the region were analyzed for trend and step changes using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the parametric Student's t-test, respectively. Based on several indicators to evaluate the streamflow-groundwater connection degree over the High Plains aquifer, we found a systematic decrease in the hydraulic connection between groundwater and streamflow from the Northern High Plains to Southern High Plains. Trends and step changes are consistent with this regional pattern. Decreasing trends in annual and dry-season (mean July-August) streamflow and increasing trends in the number of low-flow days are prevalent in the Northern High Plains with a gradual decrease in trend detection towards the south. Additionally, field significance of trends was assessed by the Regional Kendall's S test over the period of most intensive irrigation development (1940-1980). The step-change results imply that the observed decreases in streamflow are likely attributable to the significant declines in groundwater levels and unlikely related to changes in precipitation because the majority of precipitation data over the region did not reveal any significant changes. Thus, it is very likely that extensive irrigational pumping have caused streamflow depletion, more severely, in the Northern High Plains, and to a lesser extent in the Southern High Plains over the period of study.

AB  - Information on groundwater quantity as well as quality is required by water managers and decision-makers for defining a sustainable management strategy. This requires a comprehensive assessment of the surface water and groundwater resources. This paper provides an assessment of water resources management strategy in the Grombalia region (Northeast Tunisia) and its impact on quantity and quality evolution of groundwater resources based on an approach that combines (i) hydro-climatic data, (ii) field monitoring, (iii) historic piezometric records, and (iv) geochemical and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) analyses. We apply this approach to identify the origin of the various water resources and outline how the actual water management impact the quantity and quality of the groundwater in the region. As consequence of poor water resources management, the shallow groundwater levels have been disrupted: a groundwater rise is observed in the centre and a piezometric drawdown is observed in the upstream regions. Groundwater quality degradation was registered especially in the centre and downstream zones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a high-resolution conceptual hydrogeological model for complex basaltic volcanic islands based on Mayotte Island in the Comoros. Its geological structure and hydrogeological functioning are deduced from a large dataset: geological mapping, geophysics, some forty new boreholes, piezometric data, hydraulic conductivity, hydrochemical data, etc. We describe previously unknown deep cut-and-fill palaeovalleys. The resulting conceptual geological and hydrogeological model of the island is very different from the Hawaiian model, in that it lacks a low-elevation basal aquifer and dyke-impounded high-level aquifers. It is closer to the Canary Islands model, which has, however, not yet been described at a high-resolution scale. It does not have a continuous aquifer, but rather a discontinuous succession of perched aquifers separated by aquicludes and aquitards. This results more from the complex geological structure of the island, which has experienced several phases of volcanism, erosion and weathering, than from its age, but is also a result of the high-resolution scale of the model. High-resolution conceptual modelling is now necessary to solve problems of applied geology and hydrogeology.

AB  - The interaction between a wetland (the Rochefort agricultural marsh) and its underlying aquifers was studied using both geochemical and isotopic approaches. Water from the various components of the hydrosystem (water from ditches, shallow 'Bri' groundwater (silty clay deposits), deep 'Bri' groundwater and groundwater in the Kimmeridgian aquifer (confined and unconfined) was sampled and analysed for major and trace elements (Sr, Br), stable water isotopes (O-18 and H-2) and Sr isotopes. The salinity of groundwater in the marsh (Cl up to 15.5 g/l) can be attributed to seawater trapped in the clay sediments during the Flandrian (12,000-6400 BP). The groundwater has since undergone more or less major chemical evolution due to water-rock interactions and mixing with fresh water (rainwater, ditch water and Kimmeridgian groundwater from the edge of the marsh). The chemical characteristics of the groundwater in the confined Kimmeridgian underlying the Bri formation exclude the possibility of a salt wedge. The combined use of delta O-18, delta H-2, Cl, Br and Sr contents and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios enabled exchanges between surface water in marsh canals and ditches and groundwater in the shallow Bri aquifer ( < 2 m), and between groundwater in the deep Bri (> 7 m) and in the confined Kimmeridgian (> 18 m) aquifers, to be defined and quantified. During the summer, the ditches recharge the shallow Bri aquifer by sub-irrigation (gravity flow) by up to 26%. The presence of a very compact layer of clay, 1-2-m deep, prevents the rapid recharge of the deep Bri aquifer by rainfall and direct hydraulic connections between the ditches and the deep Bri aquifer. On the scale of the marsh, the confined Kimmeridgian groundwater recharges the Bri aquifer by upward flow (maximum contribution estimated to be 76 +/- 13%), this flow being relatively limited and preferentially on the edge of the marsh. The deep Bri groundwater contributes very locally to recharging the confined Kimmeridgian aquifer (maximum contribution estimated to be 61 +/- 36%). This study demonstrates the interest in combining hydrological and geochemical tools in order to identify and quantify the hydraulic interconnections between a wetland and its groundwater components. A prior understanding of how wetlands function is crucial for the sustainable management of such ecosystems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Indus basin is one of the regions in the world that is faced with major challenges for its water sector, due to population growth, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, environmental degradation, unregulated utilization of the resources, inefficient water use and poverty, all aggravated by climate change. The Indus Basin is shared by 4 countries - Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and China. With a current population of 237 million people which is projected to increase to 319 million in 2025 and 383 million in 2050, already today water resources are abstracted almost entirely (more than 95% for irrigation). Climate change will result in increased water availability in the short term. However in the long term water availability will decrease. Some current aspects in the basin need to be re-evaluated. During the past decades water abstractions - and especially groundwater extractions - have augmented continuously to support a rice-wheat system where rice is grown during the kharif (wet, summer) season (as well as sugar cane, cotton, maize and other crops) and wheat during the rabi (dry, winter) season. However, the sustainability of this system in its current form is questionable. Additional water for domestic and industrial purposes is required for the future and should be made available by a reduction in irrigation requirements. This paper gives a comprehensive listing and description of available options for current and future sustainable water resources management (WRM) within the basin. Sustainable WRM practices include both water supply management and water demand management options. Water supply management options include: (1) reservoir management as the basin is characterised by a strong seasonal behaviour in water availability (monsoon and meltwater) and water demands; (2) water quality conservation and investment in wastewater infrastructure; (3) the use of alternative water resources like the recycling of wastewater and desalination; (4) land use planning and soil conservation as well as flood management, with a focus on the reduction of erosion and resulting sedimentation as well as the restoration of ecosystem services like wetlands and natural floodplains. Water demand management options include: (1) the management of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater; as well as (2) the rehabilitation and modernization of existing infrastructure. Other demand management options are: (3) the increase of water productivity for agriculture; (4) crop planning and diversification including the critical assessment of agricultural export, especially (basmati) rice; (5) economic instruments and (6) changing food demand patterns and limiting post-harvest losses.

AB  - The objective of this study was to test the applicability of groundwater sustainability indicators defined by UNESCO, together with the International Academy of Environmental Sciences (IAES), the International Association of Hydrogeology (IAH) Group on Groundwater Indicators and the Geological Survey of Spain (IGME), to the aquifer scale. We selected four main indicators based on their relevance in the field of groundwater sustainability and because they proved to be the most reliable, based on the data collection and methodology utilized. These indicators were applied to a small-26 km(2) of permeable outcrops-carbonate aquifer situated in the province of Seville (southern Spain), which has semi-arid climate conditions (500 mm/year). The integral application of all these indicators in this particular groundwater body leads us to conclude that, at present, the aquifer is undergoing intensive use. Therefore, the exploitation of its water resources is surpassing the threshold of sustainability when both the quantity and the quality of the groundwater are taken into consideration. The continued increase in exploitation generates a descending trend in the evolution of the piezometric levels, a consequence of adaptation to the new hydrodynamic situation, and also results in exhaustion of the springs that drain the aquifer in undisturbed conditions. At the same time, there is a trend of increasing salinity in the groundwater and a risk of contamination by nitrate which, according to the EU Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Daughter Directive (EU Official Journal of the European Communities L327, 2000; EU Official Journal of the European Communities L372/19, 2006), should be controlled and reduced. In the future, application of the methodology described here may prove useful for the evaluation of similar systems, either in southern Spain or in other countries with semi-arid climates.

AB  - Blue Lake, the principal water supply for the City of Mount Gambier (South Australia), is contaminated with nitrate (NO3-) from polluted groundwater. Using existing data, a study was undertaken to determine the past load of NO3- from groundwater entering the lake and to forecast future trends in lake NO3- concentration. Groundwater NO3- loads for the 1971-1997 period were estimated with an inverse model, which combined the long-term record for NO3- concentration in the lake with a simple NO3- mass-balance. Model results show that the load of NO3- from groundwater (18-24 metric tons (t) year(-1) as N) was by far the largest source to Blue Lake between 1971 and 1997. Sinks for NO3- included pumping withdrawal (10-14 t year(-1)), in-lake consumption (7-10 t year(-1)), and groundwater outflow (0-1.8 t year(-1)). The NO3- concentration in incoming groundwater (4-7 mg N L-1) appears to have increased slowly but steadily during the 1971-1997 period (at a rate varying between 0.037 and 0.070 mg N L-1 year(-1)). By assuming that the rate of increase in groundwater NO3- concentration will remain constant, a forecast for lakewater NO3- concentration was made for the 1998-2028 period. Lakewater NO3- concentration should increase from the contemporary similar to3.5 mg N L-1 to 4 or 5 mg N L-1 by 2028. In the short term (decades), the rate of pumping withdrawal will be the main determinant of NO3- concentration in the lake through its impact on the rate of groundwater inflow and the lake water residence time. Although the drinking water guideline for NO3- (11.3 mg N L-1) may not be exceeded in the short term (decades), it may be exceeded in the longer term (centuries) as NO3- concentration in the neighbouring aquifer adjusts to the contemporary land use.

AB  - Soil water matric potentials (Psi(m)) and the deuterium (delta(2)H) composition at natural abundance levels of xylem water, soil water, river water and groundwater were used to evaluate whether trees use groundwater during the dry season in the riparian zone of the Daly River (Northern Territory, Australia). Groundwater was a significant source of water for plant transpiration, probably accounting for more than 50% of the water transpired during the dry season. Groundwater use occurred either when trees used water from the capillary fringe or when low Psi(m) induced by soil water uptake lifted groundwater in the vadose zone. Several water use strategies were inferred within the riparian plant community. Melaleuca argentea W. Fitzg and Barringtonia acutangula (L.) Gaertn. appeared to be obligate phreatophytes as they used groundwater almost exclusively and were associated with riverbanks and lower terraces with shallow ( < 5 m) water tables. Several species appeared to be facultative phreatophytes (including Cathorium umbellatum (Vahl.) Kosterm. and Acacia auriculiformiis A. Cunn. ex Benth.) and tended to rely more heavily on soil water with increased elevation in the riparian zone. The levee-bound Corymbia bella K.D. Hill and L.A.S. Johnson mostly used soil water and is either a facultative phreatophyte or a non-phreatophyte. The temporal variability in groundwater utilisation by the trees is unclear because the study focused on the end of the dry season only. A decline in the regional water table as a result of groundwater pumping may affect the health of riparian zone vegetation in the Daly River because groundwater use is significant during the dry season.

AB  - The management of groundwater, a common-pool resource, is a fundamental collective action problem that can lead to over-exploitation. Our paper examines the management of two groundwater basins in California's Central Coast region whose geographic proximity, land use patterns, socioeconomic characteristics, and timing of institutional formation provide an ideal basis for comparative study. However, each basin is governed by a distinctive institutional configuration. The Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency is a legislatively created Special Act District with a collective public management focus, while the Santa Paula Groundwater Basin is managed through a court adjudication with a rights-based focus. We compare the legal and administrative foundations of these institutional arrangements and examine their implications for the polycentric regulation of sustainable groundwater use. We find that while adjudication may specify groundwater rights, an approach that scholars argue can be critical for achieving sustainability, it also promotes insularity with a wider polycentric system and this ultimately limits its management strategies. The Special Act District, by contrast, does not encourage as clear an allocation of water rights, but does encourage a broad sustainability mission and wider polycentric engagement, though it still struggles with declining groundwater levels. Ultimately, neither institutional arrangement fully addresses the problem of groundwater sustainability. This suggests the need for further research on how institutional configurations and developmental pathways impact resource outcomes.

AB  - Groundwater provides close to 40% of California's overall water supply under average hydrologic conditions. It is a critical source of backup during drought when increased pumping occurs to compensate for reduced surface supplies and decreased soil moisture. The conundrum is that in regions of the state where groundwater dependence is already high and rates of recharge are low, over the long term the volume withdrawn, particularly during droughts, generally exceeds replenishment in many regions. The result is overdraft - ongoing declines in groundwater levels over the long-term. To facilitate the reduction or cessation of long-term groundwater overdraft, this paper proposes that sustainable groundwater management must include the development of a drought reserve. The reserve, ideally sourced, sited and used locally, would encompass sufficient water for use during a drought such that the increased withdrawals during a drought do not result in unrecoverable groundwater declines and concomitant negative impacts. The objective is to reduce vulnerability to the state's periodic droughts, as opposed to mitigating seasonal variations in precipitation. This paper first summarizes the issues associated with developing drought reserves, and then examines in detail how two California groundwater management agencies approach establishing and implementing a drought reserve.

AB  - Understanding land-use/cover change (LUCC) and groundwater resources is important for land-use planning and natural resource management. The development of agriculture has encouraged farmers in the Khanmirza plain in Iran to increase the number of agricultural wells and irrigated land over the past three decades. This has caused a continual decrease in groundwater level which threatens life in the groundwater aquifer reservoir. The present study used integrated spatiotemporal analysis to monitor changes in groundwater quantity and LUCC for sustainable resource management in Khanmirza plain. LUCCs were extracted using Landsat TM data, and groundwater quantity changes were generated for the piezometric and agricultural wells. The periods of analysis were 1987-2000, 2000-2010, and 1987-2010. Decision tree classification, ancillary data, and post-classification comparison processing was used to classify the images and LUCCs. Results showed that irrigated land increased by approximately 1350 ha and agricultural landscapes trended toward integrated land between 1987 and 2000. The most remarkable change occurred between 2000 and 2010, when the total irrigated land decreased gradually to about 1126 ha and rain-fed agriculture increased. The sharp drop in groundwater of from 7.17 to 39.1 m in this region decreased available meadow land to 1000 ha between 1987 and 2010, which decreased the area of potential agricultural land. Consequently, fragmentation of land use occurred throughout the period. These changes have produced devastating effects on different parts of the study area.

AB  - The model of a variable climate driving natural resource behaviour, use and. management of rangelands in Sub-Saharan Africa has been well explored within the non-equilibrium ecology discourse. This paper argues that concepts found in rangelands non-equilibrium thinking have considerable utility if applied to irrigation and river basin management in African savannah landscapes when irrigation has grown in area and coalesced into a larger behavioural unit. The paper suggests that a theory of transition is common to successful rangelands and water management under non-equilibrium conditions. A framework of sustainable water resources utilisation underpinned by non-equilibrium thinking is presented, and some conceptual concerns regarding normative management solutions to water scarcity in Africa are illuminated. Alternative solutions are underpinned by managing water within, and facilitating transitions between, three water supply states: critical water; medial water and bulk water. The discussion is informed by a case study from southwest Tanzania. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present work investigates the response of shallow, coastal unconfined aquifers to anticipated overdraft conditions and climate change effect using numerical simulation. The groundwater flow model MODFLOW and variable density groundwater model SEAWAT are used for this investigation. The transmissivity and specific yield estimated from the existing database range from 10 to 810 m (2)/day and 0.08% to 10.92% respectively. After successful calibration with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency greater than 0.80, the values of horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the unconfined aquifer were set in the range 1.85-61.90 m/day and 0.006-0.24 respectively. After validating the model, it is applied for forecasting the aquifer's response to anticipated future scenarios of groundwater draft, recharge rate and sea level rise. The findings of the study illustrate that saltwater intrusion is intensified in the area adjoining the tidal rivers, rather than that due to the sea alone. Of all the scenarios simulated, the immense negative impact on groundwater quality emerges due to overdraft conditions and reduced recharge with the areal extent of seawater intrusion exceeding about 67% (TDS > 1 kg/m (3)). The study also arrives at the conclusion that, regional sea level rise of 1 mm/year has no impact on the groundwater dynamics of the aquifer.

AB  - The solute transport in a tropical, coastal aquifer of southern India is numerically simulated considering the possible cases of aquifer recharge, freshwater draft, and seawater intrusion using numerical modeling software. The aquifer considered for the study is a shallow, unconfined aquifer with lateritic formations having good monsoon rains up to about 3,000mm during June to September and the rest of the months almost dry. The model is calibrated for a two-year period and validated against the available dataset, which gave satisfactory results. The groundwater flow pattern during the calibration period shows that for the month of May a depleted water table and during the monsoon month of August a saturated water table was predicted. The sensitivity analysis of model parameters reveals that the hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate are the most sensitive parameters. Based on seasonal investigation, the seawater intrusion is found to be more sensitive to pumping and recharge rates compared to the aquifer properties. The water balance study confirms that river seepage and rainfall recharge are the major input to the aquifer. The model is used to forecast the landward movement of seawater intrusion because of the anticipated increase in freshwater draft scenarios in combination with the decreased recharge rate over a longer period. The results of the predictive simulations indicate that seawater intrusion may still confine up to a distance of approximately 450-940m landward for the scenarios considered and thus are sustainable.

AB  - This study examines the implication of a market-based system to allocate water regionally in one of the most intensively irrigated areas of Greece. The proposed approach combines elements from administrative allocation and tradable water rights in order to assess several water supply scenarios under growing water scarcity conditions. In this framework, irrigation water demand functions were derived by means of an optimization model that maximizes the expected annual net benefits from water use in agriculture. Then, an inter-district water market model is developed to compute the most effective water allocation at the basin-level. An institutional reform is suggested, that is linked with the creation of effective water users' associations. The aim of this reform is to achieve a functioning and low-cost trading system at the basin level. The results show that significant volumes of water would be traded under various deficit scenarios, mainly due to the spatial heterogeneity in water use and availability.

AB  - The Ogallala Aquifer supports agricultural production and rural communities across eight US states, but the aquifer is being depleted in many areas. Depletion has continued despite numerous institutional and policy interventions, indicating that research and policy have not resulted in physical stabilization of the valuable common pool resource. We argue that explicit inquiry into the values motivating groundwater use and management is critical to conservation efforts. In this paper, we review and integrate prior social science research in the Ogallala region, drawing attention to areas where prior research considers values, implicitly or explicitly, and pointing to new or re-emerging areas for research into the relationship between human values and groundwater use, conservation, and management.

AB  - The Chateauguay River watershed extends over northeastern New York State (USA) and southwestern Quebec (Canada). Fractured sedimentary rocks of the St. Lawrence Platform host the regional aquifers. Quaternary sediments of variable thickness of up to 45 m overlie the bedrock. The geometric mean hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock aquifers obtained from 548 field measurements is 5.1 x 10(-5) m/s with a standard deviation of 0.7 of the logarithms. The modelled area extends from the foothills of the Adirondacks to the St. Lawrence River and covers 2,850 km(2). The numerical groundwater flow model was developed using the finite element simulator FEFLOW. The model has 13 layers with layer thicknesses ranging from 5 m for the top layer to 75 m for the bottom layer. The average thickness of the numerical model is 655 m, for a total volume of 1,868 km(3). The St. Lawrence River is considered as a specified head boundary; the base and other lateral limits are considered as no-flow boundaries, whereas a head and conductivity-dependent boundary is specified along major streams and wetlands. Spatial recharge rate is applied as a specified flux across the top of the model and was fixed during calibration to reduce model uncertainty. Groundwater withdrawal of 34 Mm(3)/yr is assigned using sinks for major wells and as a uniform negative flux across the top of the model to account for domestic and other diffuse uses. Calibration was carried out against 153 hydraulic head measurements, with horizontal hydraulic conductivity and vertical anisotropy used as calibration parameters. The regional groundwater flow amounts to 268 Mm(3)/yr: 12.7% is withdrawn for domestic purposes; aquifer contribution to streams and wetlands is 176 Mm(3)/yr, and 55 Mm(3)/yr is discharged to the St. Lawrence River. Groundwater flow appears to be controlled by the sub-horizontal bedding planes contributing to relatively high vertical anisotropy.

AB  - A steady increase in groundwater use in the Chateauguay River watershed has led to potential conflicts between various groundwater users. This study summarizes the quantity and sustainability estimations of the groundwater resources within this basin. Regional sustainability is defined with simulated drawdowns from uniform withdrawal scenarios compared to water levels obtained without any withdrawal. Three sustainable conditions are defined: sustainable withdrawal, withdrawal with increased drawdown, and unsustainable withdrawal. The current withdrawal rate of 34 Mm(3)/yr results in a median drawdown of 1.5 m, compared to pre-development conditions. This drawdown is well within the range considered sustainable, an indication that regional aquifers are not currently overexploited. A hypothetical pumping rate of 48 Mm(3)/yr, resulting in an average drawdown of 2.2 m, is the estimated sustainable limit. Increasing exploitation from 48 to 122 Mm(3)/yr would need tight control and planning. Withdrawal rates beyond 122 Mm(3)/yr are judged not sustainable as the regional median drawdown would exceed 8 m. The water levels in recharge areas are the most sensitive to groundwater extraction. The combination of aquifer sensitivity to recharge variations, simulated drawdown maps, and aquifer vulnerability to surface contamination reveals the most sensitive areas of the regional aquifers, areas that would need particular attention and protection by groundwater managers.

AB  - The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's food bowl and home to many iconic water bodies that are culturally and ecologically highly valued. The recent Millennium Drought (from mid-1990s to 2009) was the most severe hydrological drought since records started in the late 19th century. It severely impacted on the basin and for many acted as a wake-up call. To address the ongoing declines in water resources and environmental conditions and to prepare the region for climate change, Australia's Governments are currently attempting to introduce a new comprehensive, and integrated approach to the management of the basin's water resources. In this paper, long-term time series of climate, hydrological and environmental data are used to analyze how compounding stresses have gradually affected the hydrological system and its services. Major hydroclimatic stresses considered in this paper include salinity, water use, droughts, and climate change. Other, more localized or minor stresses exist (groundwater extraction, farm dams, afforestation, bush fires, cyanobacterial blooms and pollutants) and are reviewed more briefly. The history of water policy and planning shows that Government actions have been strongly influential on the basin. A shift in the strategic goals from water development to the protection and restoration of environmental assets is noticeable since the mid 1990s. Median climate change projections by 2030 indicate smaller reductions in rainfall and runoff than those observed during the recent Millennium Drought, but have a relatively high uncertainty attached to them. The use of regional approaches to reduce that uncertainty, such as statistical downscaling, points to a sizeable decline in rainfall by the end of the century. Most climate projections used for planning consider greenhouse emission scenarios that have smaller global emission trends than the one observed over the last decade. Other, 'less optimistic' scenarios have to be considered for long-term water planning and food security. Compounding all these stresses, is the naturally high hydroclimatic variability of this semi-arid region, that may have been insufficiently considered during previous water development and planning efforts. Successful water planning will need to balance cultural and ecological values with food production, account for high natural variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, learn from past mistakes and be cognizant of future hydrological changes.

AB  - A comprehensive overview is provided of processes and challenges related to Mediterranean groundwater resources and associated changes in recent decades. While most studies are focused thematically and/or geographically, this paper addresses different stages of groundwater exploitation in the region and their consequences. Examples emphasize the complex interactions between the physical and social dimensions of uses and evolution of groundwater. In natural conditions, Mediterranean groundwater resources represent a wide range of hydrogeological contexts, recharge conditions and rates of exploitation. They have been actively exploited for millennia but their pseudo-natural regimes have been considerably modified in the last 50 years, especially to satisfy agricultural demand (80% of total water consumption in North Africa), as well as for tourism and coastal cities. Climate variability affects groundwater dynamics but the various forms of anthropization are more important drivers of hydrological change, including changes in land use and vegetation, hydraulic works, and intense pumpings. These changes affect both the quantity and quality of groundwater at different scales, and modify the nature of hydrogeological processes, their location, timing, and intensity. The frequent cases of drastic overexploitation illustrate the fragility of Mediterranean groundwater resources and the limits of present forms of management. There is no easy way to maintain or recover sustainability, which is often threatened by short-term interests. To achieve this goal, a significant improvement in hydrogeological knowledge and closer collaboration between the various disciplines of water sciences are indispensable.

AB  - We propose a new type of seepage meter to allow sequential measurements of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) rate and SGD-driven chemical flux at a point on seawater and groundwater interface. The system works on the basis of Ah, the difference in head between groundwater and seawater at groundwater- seawater interface, and uses a vertical cylinder fixed to a buoy to derive groundwater outflow corresponding to Ah from the seepage meter chamber to the vertical cylinder. Laboratory tank tests showed that volumetric flow rate (Q) from the buoy-type seepage meter (BSM) compared very well with conventional seepage meter (CSM). The linear relationship between Q measurements with the two methods is also statistically significant (R-2 = 0.976). Two sample t-test reveals that there is not a significant difference between means of Q measurements with the two methods. R-2 values of linear regressions between volumetric flow rate (Q) and Ah are 0.993 with the BSM, and 0.972 with the CSM. Field tests with the BSM at Bangdu Bay of Jeju Island, Korea also show linear relationship (R-2 = 0.86) between SGD flux and Ah, and SGD flux and SGD-derived chemical fluxes are inversely related to tides. Both results of laboratory and field tests support that the proposed seepage meter can be an alternative to the conventional seepage meters for measuring SGD flux, and that it can be used to monitor temporal variations of SGD flux and SGD-driven chemical fluxes simultaneously.

AB  - Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is a global phenomenon that carries large volumes of groundwater and dissolved chemical species such as nutrient, metals, and organic compounds to coastal zones. We report the influence of SGD on the coastal waters of Jeju Island, Korea, using high-resolution aerial thermal infrared (TIR) mapping techniques and field investigations. An aircraft-based system was implemented using a cost-effective TIR camera for aerial TIR mapping. Ground-based calibrations and system integration with GPS/IMU (global positioning system/inertial measurement unit) were performed for the aerial systems. The aerial surveys showed distinct low-temperature signatures of SGD along the coasts of Jeju Island, revealing large groundwater inputs from the coastal aquifers to the ocean. Multiple aerial surveys over a range of seasons and tidal stages revealed that SGD rates dynamically affect the sea surface temperature (SST) of the coastal zone. The in-situ measurements supported that SGD has a substantial influence on the coastal water chemistry as well as SST. Our observations highlight the extent to which aerial-based TIR mapping can serve as a powerful tool for studying SGD and other coastal processes. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Coastal areas where submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) occurs are active mixing zones with characteristic biogeochemical and ecological functions. In this study, we investigated the microbial community associated with the changes in groundwater discharge flux at a coastal beach site on Jeju Island, South Korea. We performed water chemistry analyses, 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing, and microbial community statistical analyses on coastal water samples systematically collected as functions of tidal stage and distance from the groundwater discharge point. We also carried out groundwater level monitoring and numerical simulation of the coastal aquifer to reproduce tidally induced variations in the SGD rates of the study site. Pyrosequencing and statistical analyses revealed a periodic shift in the microbial communities in the coastal waters as functions of tidal stage and SGD rates. Interestingly, the community structures in the samples collected at flood and ebb tide were markedly different, despite the similarities in their water chemistry. Groundwater simulation and canonical correspondence analyses suggest that groundwater discharging at higher velocities at ebb tide can detach and transport subsurface bacteria from the aquifer to the coastal water body, resulting in an increase in facultative anaerobes in the ebb tide samples. In addition, release of the sand-attached bacteria as a result of particle resuspension and flushing of shallow subsurface bacteria in the intertidal zone could contribute to shaping the relative abundance of the coastal microbial community. We conclude that SGD rate is an important factor influencing the dynamics of the bacterial community structure at the coastal zone of the study site.

AB  - Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is a widely recognized process that carries considerable amounts of groundwater and dissolved chemicals to the coastal ocean. Despite its importance, a lack of suitable tools to assess SGD's spatial and temporal variability has hampered a complete understanding of the process. Here we report, for the first time, use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or "drone") to assess SGD variations. An octocopter UAV platform equipped with a thermal infrared (TIR) system was flown along a coastline on Jeju Island, Korea. The UAV clearly captured thermal signatures of SGD plumes and their dynamic temporal fluctuations modulated by tidal variations. Based on a plume area-SGD flux relation we developed by combining aerial and field data, we estimated that the SGD flux of the study site ranged from 33,000 to 54,000 m(3) d(-1). The drone approach enabled acquisition of time series plume imagery with easy control of spatial resolution, flexible field operations, and remote sensing of SGD at low cost compared to conventional aerial surveys. Combining the UAV-TIR images with on-site sampling enables one to determine fluxes of nutrients and other dissolved species. UAV-TIR mapping can thus serve as a powerful tool for study of SGD and other coastal processes.

AB  - The Dust Bowl refers to a disaster focused in the Southern Great Plains of North America during the 1930s, when the region experienced extreme wind erosion. Dry farming techniques increased soil erodibility. Drought reduced both soil cohesion, making it more erodible, and land cover, leaving the soil less protected from wind action. Low crop prices (driven by the Great Depression), extremely poor harvests (driven by drought), and lack of knowledge of regionally-appropriate tillage practices left farmers unable to implement erosion control on their land. The 1930s drought was severe, but neither unusual in the region nor extreme in length from a climatological perspective. Sea-surface temperature changes in the Atlantic and Pacific forced changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation over North America. The result was persistent, intensifying drought within the Southern Great Plains for multiple years, causing a cascade of desiccation. Increased atmospheric dust and increased frequency of cyclones crossing the region may also have exacerbated Dust Bowl conditions. The Dust Bowl resulted from the simultaneous combination of drought and economic depression in a region where farmers had not yet learned effective land management techniques. Economic recovery, cessation of drought, and implementation of erosion control programs combined to end the Dust Bowl by the end of the 1930s. Many lessons were learned from the 1930s Dust Bowl regarding the physical and anthropogenic causes of dust storms and how to mitigate them. As a result, though dust storms continue on the Southern Great Plains, their severity is significantly reduced. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The magnitude of submarine fresh groundwater discharge (SFGD) was estimated using a freshwater budget of the coastal water, which was calculated from salinity anomalies off a volcanic island, Jeju, Korea. We obtained high-resolution profiles of salinity from the entire coastal area of Jeju Island using accurate CTD sensors. Lower salinity anomalies relative to the pristine offshore seawaters were observed and assumed to be a result of SFGD on the basis of negligible surface runoffs from the island and the relatively high levels of Rn-222 in the low-salinity waters. The SFGD flux during the study period calculated from a freshwater budget of the water column was 2.5 - 3.8 x 10(6) m(3) d(-1), which is close to the long-term average based on the inland water balance. Our study shows that SFGD can be accurately and easily measured using a freshwater budget of the coastal waters off a highly permeable coastal zone with little surface runoff.

AB  - We present a review of groundwater studies over the past 50 years (1968-2017) in Korea. With economic and agricultural growth, water demand has been expanding, and groundwater development is gradually increasing. Initially, groundwater studies were largely focused on using pumping and slug tests to understand aquifers in Korea. However, the interest has expanded to groundwater monitoring and data analyses, as many national and local networks for monitoring groundwater quantity and quality have been implemented. Frequent severe droughts in recent decades have led to research on the design and pilot tests for managed aquifer recharge, especially on the volcanic island of Jeju and agricultural areas. As groundwater development and its use has increased, groundwater contamination is becoming a public grievance. Thus, effective investigation of contaminated groundwater and its efficient remediation are big issues in the Research and Development (R & D) sector. The recent Gyeongju earthquake posed an additional challenge for Korean groundwater scientists to develop a method to predict earthquakes using groundwater monitoring. Furthermore, changes in precipitation patterns caused by the changing climate aggravate groundwater recharge conditions. The country has seen many academic and technical achievements in groundwater science, but many issues remain to be resolved in the near future.

AB  - During the past few decades, excessive input of nutrients and organic matter, in addition to global ocean acidification, has resulted in significant changes in the water pH of coastal ocean. In this study, we investigated the effect of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) on pH variations in the coastal waters of Hwasun Bay off the volcanic island of Jeju, Korea, which is situated in the oligotrophic open ocean. In this region, salinities of all coastal waters depend primarily on SGD because of the lack of any contributions from the river or stream waters. We observed a significant increase in pH along the lower-salinity plume zone, extending 0.5 km horizontally from the bottom to the surface (< 15 m water depth). The observed data for the entire bay-water column showed a significant negative correlation (r(2) = 0.82) between salinity and pH. A simple two-endmember (submarine groundwater and offshore seawater) mixing model showed that this pH increase was caused by an enhanced biological production, which resulted from the SGD-driven nutrient inputs, rather than from groundwater dilution itself. Since a number of local and regional studies showed that SGD-driven fluxes of nutrients are comparable to or higher than their riverine fluxes, our results from an SGD-dominated environment suggest that SGD may have a significant influence on the coastal biogeochemical changes such as acidification, deoxygenation, and eutrophication.

AB  - We measured pH, total alkalinity (TAlk), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and C-13-DIC in groundwater of a subterranean estuary in Hwasun Bay in the volcanic island of Jeju, Korea. In the sandy aquifer, the pH values (7.4 +/- 0.2) of fresh groundwater increased sharply to approximate to 10 and then behaved conservatively in the mixing zone between alkalified fresh groundwater and seawater. The distributions of C-13-DIC, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in coastal groundwater, along with the results from lab experiments on sediment columns, suggest that the increase of pH in this subterranean estuary is associated with the adsorption of protons (protonation) onto sandy sediments, rather than other geochemical processes. Our lab experiments showed that the protonation (1) occurs commonly for various sediments of Jeju Island, (2) increases pH effectively for low-salinity (salinity<10) groundwater, and (3) depends on the relative amount of transition metal (i.e., Fe, Ti, and Mn) oxides. The chamber experiments at the interface of seawater and groundwater indicate the direct seepage of high pH water into the ocean. This increase in pH leads to corresponding uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. Thus, our result suggests that the reaction between groundwater and coastal sediments should be considered as an important driver of pH change that regulates the magnitude of chemical species in coastal groundwater seeping into the ocean at the volcanic island, Jeju, Korea.

AB  - In order to analyze water movement through an unsaturated soil zone in Jeju Island, Korea, temporal variations in the oxygen-18 and deuterium isotopes of precipitation and soil waters at three different depths were monitored for about one year. The stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of the soil waters are plotted between or near the two local meteoric water lines for summer and winter precipitation indicating that the soil waters were recharged from the year-around precipitation, and evaporation was negligible even during hot summer season in the study area. Mean residence times of the soil waters were then estimated from the delta O-18, delta D, and deuterium excess or d-values of the precipitation and soil waters using two well-mixed or exponential models (EM) and one exponential piston-flow model (EPM). The regression results show that the combination of the exponential piston-flow model and the d-values of the precipitation and soil waters gives the most reasonable estimation of the mean residence times of the soil waters in the study area. It suggests that the deuterium excess or d-values can be used as a better parameter than the delta O-18 or delta D values alone for estimating mean residence times of subsurface waters not only in Korea but also in other Northeast Asian countries. The estimated low moisture contents and hydraulic diffusivities of the soils at the three different depths also indicate that the boundary between the upper fine-grained soil and the lower coarse-grained soil may act as a capillary barrier, and the soil waters probably flow slowly through micropores rather than rapidly through macropores in the unsaturated soil zone.

AB  - A comparison of deuterium excess or d-values of precipitation and groundwater at Cheju Island, Korea, indicates that, unlike in many temperate climates, precipitation during the whole year contributes to groundwater recharge. This in turn suggests that evapotranspiration effects are minimal, consistent with the fact that the island contains highly permeable volcanic rocks overlain by thin soils. This hypothesis is contrary to current water budget models that ascribe a significant role to evapotranspiration processes. Three coastal springs, and several streams and ponds throughout the island have enriched delta O-18 and delta D values that plot off the local meteoric water line and have relatively high Cl concentrations. This relationship is suggestive of seawater mixing for the coastal springs and evaporation for the streams and ponds. This database thus provides a useful means for evaluation of groundwater resources of the island. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The long-term balance between net precipitation and net groundwater exchange that maintains thousands of seepage lakes in Florida's karst terrain is explored at a representative lake basin and then regionally for the State's peninsular lake district. The 15-year water budget of Lake Starr includes El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related extremes in rainfall, and provides the longest record of Bowen ratio energy-budget (BREB) lake evaporation and lake-groundwater exchanges in the southeastern United States. Negative net precipitation averaging -25 cm/yr at Lake Starr overturns the previously-held conclusion that lakes in this region receive surplus net precipitation. Net groundwater exchange with the lake was positive on average but too small to balance the net precipitation deficit. Groundwater pumping effects and surface-water withdrawals from the lake widened the imbalance. Satellite-based regional estimates of potential evapotranspiration at five large lakes in peninsular Florida compared well with basin-scale evaporation measurements from seven open-water sites that used BREB methods. The regional average lake evaporation estimated for Lake Starr during 1996-2011 was within 5% of its measured average, and regional net precipitation agreed within 10%. Regional net precipitation to lakes was negative throughout central peninsular Florida and the net precipitation deficit increased by about 20 cm from north to south. Results indicate that seepage lakes farther south on the peninsula receive greater net groundwater inflow than northern lakes and imply that northern lakes are in comparatively leakier hydrogeologic settings. Findings reveal the peninsular lake district to be more vulnerable than was previously realized to drier climate, surface-water withdrawals from lakes, and groundwater pumping effects.

AB  - To understand the contribution of submarine ground-water discharge (SGD) to the coastal mass budgets of Hg and monomethylmercury (MMHg), preliminary mass balance estimates were made for Hwasun and Bangdu Bays on Jeju Island, known to have large SGD due to the high permeability of the volcanic rocks. The mass balance results indicate that SGD is a main source of Hg in Hwasun Bay (23 +/- 14 x 10(-2) mol yr(-1), 34%) and Bangdu Bay (23 +/- 20 x 10(-2) mol yr(-1), 67%), although the contribution from atmospheric deposition was considerable (25% for Hwasun and 23% for Bangdu). MM:Hg was also discharged primarily from submarine groundwater at Hwasun (0.30 +/- 0.17 x 10(-2) mol yr(-1), 55%) and Bangdu (0.65 +/- 0.49 x 10(-2) mol yr(-1), 64%), which was higher than atmospheric deposition (6% for Hwasun and 2% for Bangdu) and sediment diffusion flux (5% for Hwasun and 3% for Bangdu). The overall mass balance results suggest that, although there are large spatial variations in SGD rates throughout the region, the coastal mass budgets of Hg and MMHg need to include SGD as well as atmospheric deposition and sediment diffusion as primary sources of Hg and MMHg.

AB  - Rivers and streams that do not flow permanently (herein intermittent rivers; IRs) make up a large proportion of the world's inland waters and are gaining widespread attention. We review the research on IRs from its early focus on natural history through to current application in management and policy. The few early studies of the ecology of IRs were largely descriptive. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, synthesis of this sparse research complemented work on temporary standing waters to found a powerful framework for much of the subsequent research on IRs. Research on the ecology and biogeochemistry of IRs continues to fuel our understanding of resistance and resilience to drying and flooding as disturbances. Syntheses of the growing literature, including cross-continental and cross-climate comparisons, are revealing the generality and individuality of ecological and ecosystem responses to flow cessation and surface water loss. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of experiments test the causality of these responses. Much of the increased consideration of IRs in research, management and policy is driven by the observed and projected shifts in flow regimes from perennial to intermittent associated with changes in land and water use and climate, superimposed on the high incidence of natural intermittency. The need to protect and better manage IRs is prompting researchers to develop new or modified methods to monitor flow status and assess the ecological condition of these systems. Intermittent river research and management will benefit from greater exploration of aquatic-terrestrial linkages, wet-dry cycling and temporal dynamics, more-detailed mapping and predictive modelling of flow intermittency and the application of metapopulation and metacommunity concepts alongside multiple-stressors and novel-ecosystems research. By building on existing knowledge, continuing to develop quantitative models and distribution maps and using experiments to test hypotheses and concepts, we can further ecological understanding and wise management of these ubiquitous ecosystems.

AB  - Successful groundwater resources evaluation and management is nowadays typically undertaken using distributed numerical groundwater flow models. Such models largely rely on hydrogeological conceptual models. The conceptual models summarize hydrogeological knowledge of an area to be modelled and thereby providing a framework for numerical model design. In this study, an efficient data integration method for developing hydrogeological conceptual model of the large and hydrogeologically-complex, Central Kalahari Basin (CKB) aquifer system, was undertaken. In that process, suitability of 3-D geological modelling with RockWorks code in iterative combination with standard GIS (ArcGIS) was tested. As a result, six hydrostratigraphic units were identified, their heads and related flow system interdependencies evaluated and hydraulic properties attached. A characteristic feature of the CKB is a thick unsaturated Kalahari Sand Unit (KSU), that restricts the erratic recharge input to < 1 mm yr(-1) in the centre to about 5-10 mm yr(-1) in the eastern fringe. The analysis of the spatial distribution of topological surfaces of the hydrostratigraphic units and hydraulic heads of the aquifers, allowed to identify three flow systems of the three aquifers, Lebung, Ecca and Ghanzi, all three having similar radially-concentric regional groundwater flow patterns directed towards discharge area of Makgadikgadi Pans. That pattern similarity is likely due to various hydraulic interconnections, direct or through aquitard leakages, and also due to the presence of the overlying unconfined, surficial KSU, hydraulically connected with all the three aquifers, redistributing recharge into them. The proposed 3-D geological modelling with RockWorks, turned to be vital and efficient in developing hydrogeological conceptual model of a large and complex multilayered aquifer systems. Its strength is in simplicity of operation, in conjunctive, iterative use with other software such as standard GIS and in flexibility to interface with numerical groundwater model. As a result of conceptual modelling, fully 3-d, 6 layer numerical model, with shallow, variably-saturated, unconfined layer is finally recommended as a transition from conceptual into numerical model of the CKB.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is becoming an increasingly widespread tool in support systems for environmental decision-making regarding the cleanup of contaminated sites. In this study, the use of LCA to compare the environmental impacts of different remediation technologies was reviewed. Remediation of a contaminated site reduces a local environmental problem, but at the same time, the remediation activities may cause negative environmental impacts on the local, regional, and global scale. LCA can be used to evaluate the inherent trade-off and to compare remediation scenarios in terms of their associated environmental burden. An overview of the assessed remediation technologies and contaminant types covered in the literature is presented. The LCA methodologies of the 12 reviewed studies were compared and discussed with special focus on their goal and scope definition and the applied impact assessment. The studies differ in their basic approach since some are prospective with focus on decision-support while others are retrospective aiming at a more detailed assessment of a completed remediation project. The literature review showed that only few life cycle assessments have been conducted for in situ remediation technologies aimed at groundwater-threatening contaminants and that the majority of the existing literature focuses on ex situ remediation of contaminated soil. The functional unit applied in the studies is generally based on the volume of contaminated soil (or groundwater) to be treated; this is in four of the studies combined with a cleanup target for the remediation. While earlier studies often used more simplified impact assessment models, the more recent studies based their impact assessment on established methodologies covering the conventional set of impact categories. Ecotoxicity and human toxicity are the impact categories varying the most between these methodologies. Many of the reviewed studies address the importance of evaluating both primary and secondary impacts of site remediation. Primary impacts cover the local impacts related to residual contamination left in the subsurface during and after remediation and will vary between different remediation technologies due to different cleanup efficiencies and cleanup times. Secondary impacts are resource use and emissions arising in other stages of the life cycle of the remediation project. Among the reviewed literature, different approaches for modeling the long-term primary impacts of site contamination have been used. These include steady state models as well as dynamic models. Primary impacts are not solely a soil contamination or surface water issue, since many frequently occurring contaminants, such as chlorinated solvents, have the potential to migrate to the groundwater as well as evaporate to ambient air causing indoor climate problems. Impacts in the groundwater compartment are not included in established impact assessment methodologies; thus, the potential groundwater contamination impacts from residual contamination are difficult to address in LCA of site remediation. Due to the strong dependence on local conditions (sensitivity of groundwater aquifer, use for drinking water supply, etc.) a more site-specific impact assessment approach than what is normally applied in LCA is of relevance. The inclusion of groundwater impacts from soil contaminants requires the definition of an impact category covering human toxicity via groundwater or the inclusion of these impacts in the human toxicity impact category and the associated characterization models and normalization procedures. When evaluating groundwater impacts, attention should also be paid to potentially degradable contaminants forming metabolites of higher human toxic concern than the parent compound.

AB  - While most age data derived from tracers have been analyzed in steady-state flow conditions, we determine their temporal evolution when starting a pumping. Our study is based on a model made up of a shallowly dipping aquifer overlain by a less permeable aquitard characteristic of the crystalline aquifer of Ploemeur (Brittany, France). Under a pseudo transient flow assumption (instantaneous shift between two steady-state flow fields), we solve the transport equation with a backward particle-tracking method and determine the temporal evolution of the concentrations at the pumping well of CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113 and SF6. Apparent ages evolve because of the modifications of the flow pattern and because of the non-linear evolution of the tracer atmospheric concentrations. To identify the respective role of these two causes, we propose two successive analyses. We first convolute residence time distributions initially arising at different times at the same sampling time. We secondly convolute one residence time distribution at various sampling times. We show that flow pattern modifications control the apparent ages evolution in the first pumping year when the residence time distribution is modified from a piston-like distribution to a much broader distribution. In the first pumping year, the apparent age evolution contains transient information that can be used to better constrain hydrogeological systems and slightly compensate for the small number of tracers. Later, the residence time distribution hardly evolves and apparent ages only evolve because of the tracer atmospheric concentrations. In this phase, apparent age time-series do not reflect any evolution in the flow pattern. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interactions between headwater aquifers and peatlands have received limited scientific attention. Hydrological stresses, including those related to climate change, may adversely impact these interactions. In this study, the dynamics of a southern Quebec headwater system where a peatland is present is simulated under current conditions and with climate change. The model is calibrated in steady state on field-measured data and provides satisfactory results for transient-state conditions. Under current conditions, simulations confirm that the peatland is fed by the fractured bedrock aquifer year-round and provides continuous baseflow to its outlets. Climate change is simulated through its impact on groundwater recharge. Predicted precipitation and temperature data from a suite of regional climate model scenarios provide a net precipitation variation range from +10% to -30% for the 2041-2070 horizon. Calibrated recharge is modified within this range to perform a sensitivity analysis of the headwater model to recharge variations (+10%, -15% and -30%). Total contribution from the aquifer to rivers and streams varies from +14% to -44% of the baseline for +10% to -30% recharge changes from spring 2010 data, for example. With higher recharge, the peatland receives more groundwater, which could significantly change its vegetation pattern and eventually ecosystem functions. For a -30% recharge, the peatland becomes perched above the aquifer during the summer, fall and winter. Recharge reductions also induce sharp declines in groundwater levels and drying streams.

AB  - Groundwater/surface-water interaction is receiving increasing focus in Africa due to its importance to ecologic systems and sustainability. In South Africa's 1998 National Water Act (NWA), water-use licenses, including groundwater, are granted only after defining the Reserve, the amount of water needed to supply basic human needs and preserve some ecological integrity. Accurate quantification of groundwater contributions to ecosystems for successful implementation of the NWA proves challenging; many of South Africa's aquifers are in heterogeneous and anisotropic fractured-rock settings. This paper reviews the current conceptualizations and investigative approaches regarding groundwater/surface-water interactions in the context of South African policies. Some selected pitfall experiences are emphasized. The most common approach in South Africa is estimation of average annual fluxes at the scale of fourth-order catchments (similar to 500 km(2)) with baseflow separation techniques and then subtracting the groundwater discharge rate from the recharge rate. This approach might be a good start, but it ignores spatial and temporal variability, potentially missing local impacts associated with production-well placement. As South Africa's NWA has already been emulated in many countries including Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya, the successes and failures of the South African experience dealing with the groundwater/surface-water interaction will be analyzed to guide future policy directions.

AB  - Fluvial bank erosion rates are often quantified by assuming that the erosion rate is a function of the excess (above a critical threshold) boundary shear stress applied by the flow. Research has shown that the form roughness induced by natural topographic bank features, such as slumps, spurs and embayments, is the dominant component of the spatially-averaged total shear stress, meaning that form roughness provides an important control on bank erosion rates. However, measuring the relative components of the total shear stress for a natural system is not straightforward. In this work we use the method of Kean and Smith to partition the form and skin drag components of river bank roughness using a time series (2005-2011) of high-resolution topographic surveys of an eroding bank of the Cecina River in central Italy. This method approximates the form drag component of the roughness along a longitudinal bank profile as a series of user-defined Gaussian curves. The extracted metrics are used in conjunction with an estimate of the outer region flow velocity to partition the form and skin drag components of the total boundary shear stress according to the Kean and Smith analytical solution. The relative magnitude of the form and skin shear stress at each survey date is analysed alongside DEMs of difference to reveal that intense episodes of erosion are followed by periods of quiescence. We show that this is due to the protection offered by increased form drag roughness following erosion. We conceptualise the dynamic feedbacks that exist between river discharge, bank erosion processes and bank form roughness, into a simple model of the self-limiting nature of river bank erosion.

AB  - The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is the world's most water-stressed region, with its countries constituting 12 of the 15 most water-stressed countries globally. Because of data paucity, comprehensive regional-scale assessments of groundwater resources in the MENA region have been lacking. The presented study addresses this issue by using a distributed ArcGIS model, parametrized with gridded data sets, to estimate groundwater storage reserves in the region based on generated aquifer saturated thickness and effective porosity estimates. Furthermore, monthly gravimetric datasets (GRACE) and land surface parameters (GLDAS) were used to quantify changes in groundwater storage between 2003 and 2014. Total groundwater reserves in the region were estimated at 1.28 x 10(6) cubic kilometers (km(3)) with an uncertainty range between 816,000 and 1.93 x 10(6) km(3). Most of the reserves are located within large sedimentary basins in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, with Algeria, Libya, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia accounting for approximately 75% of the region's total freshwater reserves. Alternatively, small groundwater reserves were found in fractured Precambrian basement exposures. As for groundwater changes between 2003 and 2014, all MENA countries except for Morocco exhibited declines in groundwater storage. However, given the region's large groundwater reserves, groundwater changes between 2003 and 2014 are minimal and represent no immediate short-term threat to the MENA region, with some exceptions. Notwithstanding this, the study recommends the development of sustainable and efficient groundwater management policies to optimally utilize the region's groundwater resources, especially in the face of climate change, demographic expansion, and socio-economic development.

AB  - Groundwater is an important source of freshwater throughout the world. Due to over-exploitation of groundwater over many years, a number of potential adverse hydrogeological problems have raised. To reduce such adverse effects, it is necessary to carry out strict groundwater management in over-exploited areas. In this study, quantity-level binary control management mode has been developed in Tianjin. Initially, the management is the key to determine control levels of groundwater including the blue line levels (proper levels) and red line levels (warning levels), the blue line levels can be determined by the ground settlement recovery scenario, and the red line levels can be determined through planning groundwater exploitation scenarios. By comparing the real-time observed groundwater data with the blue levels and red levels the management grade of groundwater levels which are present, can thus be identified. Secondly, the corresponding management strategies would be determined by the management grade. On this basis reasonable groundwater levels and mining schemes can be made. Finally, the water quota for each sector can be optimized and adjusted in real time according to the binary groundwater management methodology established in this study. Thus, the exploitation of groundwater can be monitored and dynamically managed by the real-time monitoring levels and the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources can be achieved. To achieve all the objectives mentioned above, it is necessary to provide a powerful tool through the utilization of a numerical model for groundwater management. Based on geological and hydrogeological conditions in Tianjin city, a three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model was established by coupling a one-dimensional soil consolidation model with MODFLOW model. Through calibration and verification, the model showed good simulation accuracy. It proved that the new management mode can provide a scientific basis for groundwater management.

AB  - With the rapid development of economy, demand of water resources is becoming larger and larger, and over-exploitation of groundwater is common in many areas. Due to over-exploitation of groundwater over many years, a number of potential adverse hydrogeological problems have raised. To reduce such adverse effects, it is necessary to carry out strict groundwater management in over-exploited areas. And to achieve the strictest management of groundwater, it is critical to determine control levels of groundwater including the blue line levels (proper levels) and red line levels (warning levels). According to the establishment of evaluation model of shallow and deep groundwater exploitation and utilization risks, it can be observed that the groundwater level index factor is included in the evaluation index system in different groundwater function zones. Therefore, there is a corresponding relationship between the risk grade and groundwater level of different underground aquifers. The risk grade of different groundwater function zones in Tianjin is divided into five grades, which contributes to the risk management of groundwater, avoiding the arising of a wide range of risk management measure. However, to determine the key groundwater level, the standard of five grades cannot meet the requirements. The risk grades need to be divided more subtly. Hence, in this paper, the risk grade was divided according to the standard of sixteen grades based on that of five grades in the first place. The higher the grade is, the greater the risk. And then the occurrence frequency of risk grade for each aquifer was counted in each administrative district or country. The corresponding water level of the risk grade, whose occurrence frequency was the highest, served as the base level. The water level of groundwater that would be exploited and utilized in the future cannot be below this base level. In consequence, this water level that served as the red line level was the minimum requirement in the planning years, while the corresponding water levels of other risk grades that were inferior to this risk grade can all be seen as red line levels. And the planning period the long-term corresponding groundwater level of the aquifers under mining-banned condition can be used as blue line control levels of the different planning years. Finally, according to the determinate range of red line level change amplitude in each district or country, as well as the ultimate restoration aim of groundwater levels (blue line levels), corresponding measures were taken step by step to achieve the overall rising of groundwater levels. The obtained determinate control levels can provide a scientific basis for dynamic management of groundwater.

AB  - This paper assesses the effectiveness of aquifer monitoring information in achieving more sustainable use of a groundwater resource in the absence of management policy. Groundwater user behavior in the face of an irreversible contamination threat is studied by applying methods of experimental economics to scenarios that combine a physics-based, spatially explicit, numerical groundwater model with different representations of information about an aquifer and its risk of contamination. The results suggest that the threat of catastrophic contamination affects pumping decisions: pumping is significantly reduced in experiments where contamination is possible compared to those where pumping cost is the only factor discouraging groundwater use. The level of information about the state of the aquifer also affects extraction behavior. Pumping rates differ when information that synthesizes data on aquifer conditions (a risk gauge) is provided, despite invariant underlying economic incentives, and this result does not depend on whether the risk information is location-specific or from a whole aquifer perspective. Interestingly, users increase pumping when the risk gauge signals good aquifer status compared to a no-gauge treatment. When the gauge suggests impending contamination, however, pumping declines significantly, resulting in a lower probability of contamination. The study suggests that providing relatively simple aquifer condition guidance derived from monitoring data can lead to more sustainable use of groundwater resources.

AB  - In this study, a human health risk constrained groundwater remediation management program based on the improved credibility is developed for naphthalene contamination. The program integrates simulation, multivariate regression analysis, health risk assessment, uncertainty analysis, and nonlinear optimization into a general framework. The improved credibility-based optimization model for groundwater remediation management with consideration of human health risk (ICOM-HHR) is capable of not only effectively addressing parameter uncertainties and risk-exceeding possibility in human health risk but also providing a credibility level that indicates the satisfaction of the optimal groundwater remediation strategies with multiple contributions of possibility and necessity. The capabilities and effectiveness of ICOM-HHR are illustrated through a real-world case study in Anhui Province, China. Results indicate that the ICOM-HHR would generate double remediation cost yet reduce approximately 10 times of the naphthalene concentrations at monitoring wells, i.e., mostly less than 1 mu g/L, which implies that the ICOM-HHR usually results in better environmental and health risk benefits. And it is acceptable to obtain a better environmental quality and a lower health risk level with sacrificing a certain economic benefit.

AB  - Water scarcity causes conflicts among natural resources, society and economy and reinforces the need for optimal allocation of irrigation water resources in a sustainable way. Uncertainties caused by natural conditions and human activities make optimal allocation more complex. An intuitionistic fuzzy multi objective non-linear programming (IFMONLP) model for irrigation water allocation under the combination of dry and wet conditions is developed to help decision makers mitigate water scarcity. The model is capable of quantitatively solving multiple problems including crop yield increase, blue water saving, and water supply cost reduction to obtain a balanced water allocation scheme using a multi-objective nonlinear programming technique. Moreover, it can deal with uncertainty as well as hesitation based on the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Consideration of the combination of dry and wet conditions for water availability and precipitation makes it possible to gain insights into the various irrigation water allocations, and joint probabilities based on copula functions provide decision makers an average standard for irrigation. A case study on optimally allocating both surface water and groundwater to different growth periods of rice in different subareas in Heping irrigation area, Qing'an County, northeast China shows the potential and applicability of the developed model. Results show that the crop yield increase target especially in tillering and elongation stages is a prevailing concern when more water is available, and trading schemes can mitigate water supply cost and save water with an increased grain output. Results also reveal that the water allocation schemes are sensitive to the variation of water availability and precipitation with uncertain characteristics. The IFMONLP model is applicable for most irrigation areas with limited water supplies to determine irrigation water strategies under a fuzzy environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite rapid economic growth and industrialization in the Huai River Basin within Shandong Province, water quality improved during 2005-2010 under state-controlled monitoring. The industrial structure theory, environmental Kuznets curve, and statistical analyses were used to examine correlations between economic development and industrial water pollutant loads. The beverage, textile, paper, and food processing industries are major polluters, and structural pollution deters simultaneous industrialization and water resource management. This paper proposes policy actions and indicates that constant adjustments to the industrial structure are important for promoting coordinated growth of industry and water environmental protection.

AB  - Global curve-fitting method (GCFM) is regarded as an effective approach in hydrogeological parameter estimation, as it integrates and uses pumping data and water recovery data of a transient pumping test for parameter estimation. The impacts of pumping duration on hydrogeological parameter estimation by GCFM were investigated in the present study using 2 in situ pumping tests and 24 simulated transient pumping tests. Empirical formulas for determining the optimal pumping duration were derived. The study results suggest that pumping duration will have impacts on the accuracy of hydrogeological parameter estimation. When pumping duration is longer than a certain period, relative errors of hydrogeological parameter estimation keep relatively stable within an acceptable limit. Therefore, it is unnecessary to continue the pumping for a very long time after the groundwater level has become stable. When the change rate of drawdown over time (gamma) in an observation well located within a distance of 100 m to the pumping well reaches 0.134, the pumping can be stopped. If there are more than one observation wells in a pumping test, the smallest gamma value should be selected to determine the optimal pumping duration. This research is meaningful in the instruction of pumping tests, and will reduce test costs greatly.

The development of analyses that detail the surface water-groundwater system may lead to more effective utilization of available water. A tool was developed to help determine the effects of groundwater and surface water interactions. The software tool includes two graphic user interfaces to allow full compatibility with numerical MODFLOW groundwater models. This case study shows the tool, in conjunction with MODFLOW groundwater models and carefully designed scenarios, can successfully calculate the rates of stream-groundwater interactions, thereby providing the basis for designating management areas with the most significant hydrologic impact. This tool can be applied in other regions with similar settings and needs for integrated water management.

AB  - Research on shale lithofacies is important for shale oil and gas production. This study focused on the lower third member of the Shahejie Formation (Es-3(l)) in the Luo-69 well in the Zhanhua Sag, Jiyang Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China. Several methods, including thin section observations, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, quantitative evaluations of minerals by scanning electron microscopy, major and trace-element analyses, and field emission-scanning electron microscopy, are used to investigate the effect of sedimentary environment on the type and distribution of shale lithofacies. Our research indicates that 36 types of shale lithofacies can be classified based on the TOC content, mineral composition, and sedimentary structure, of which five types are identified in the study area. The Es-3(l) shale has a high calcareousmineral content (average of 49.64%), low clay and siliceous minerals contents (averages of 19.54% and 19.02%, respectively), a high TOC content (average of 3.00 wt%), and well-developed horizontal bedding. The sedimentary environment during the deposition of the Es-3(l) shale in the Zhanhua Sag had a warm and moist climate, limited provenance, saline water, and strong reducibility. The sedimentary environment in the early stage had a drier climate, more limited provenance, higher salinity, and stronger reducibility than that in the later stage. Shale lithofacies can reflect a certain sedimentary environment and depositional process; similarly, a depositional environment controls the type and distribution of shale lithofacies. Due to the characteristics of the Es-3(l) sedimentary environment, organic-rich massive mixed shale, organic-rich bedded mixed-calcareous shale, organic-rich laminated calcareous shale, and organic-fair laminated calcareous shale are developed in the Es-3(l) formation from top to bottom.

AB  - Traditional analysis approaches to water resource carrying capacity cannot be directly applied to data-deficient regions where water resources have been exploited excessively. Gross domestic products (GDPs) also cannot be used directly as objective functions of regional benefits. New objective functions should be established by analysing limited available data and mining useful implied information. Based on the principle of water resource supply-demand balance, a new evaluation criterion of regional benefits is presented using the non-linear regression analysis approach. An analysis model of groundwater carrying capacity was then established and is solved with the Lagrange multiplier method. A case study of groundwater resource carrying capacity in 2010 and 2015 in the Yaoba Oasis irrigation district, Alxa Left Prefecture, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, was performed. Results demonstrate that the model has the ability of evaluating and determining the groundwater resource carrying capacity in this overloaded and data-scarce region. The carrying capacity level of groundwater in this irrigation district is rather low and the development potential is limited. In order to reduce the exploitation of groundwater resources and achieve the sustainable development of the oasis in future, a system of agricultural water-saving irrigation must be set up to reduce the irrigation quotas and the irrigation water requirement. The arable areas should be reduced and the living standards of local people should also be raised. The results obtained from these applications have proved that the analysis model presented in this study is a new and promising method which can be employed in data-scarce and overloaded regions.

AB  - Mulched drip irrigation for cotton field is an effective measure for the utilization of saline water, and the regulation of soil water and salt. However, the reasonable methods for quantifying actual evapotranspiration (ET) and deep percolation of recharge to groundwater are still not very well understood, which restricts the accurate regulation of soil water and salt for cotton growth in oasis. In this paper, a set of experiments of mulched drip irrigation with brackish water were conducted in a typical arid region of Tarim basin in southern Xinjiang, China. The irrigation events were recorded, and ET and fluctuations of groundwater table were carefully measured for two consecutive irrigation periods of flowering and boiling stages. A group of upscaling conversion methods were used to quantify the ET, in which canopy structure was considered to estimate the transpiration from leaf scale to a unit of field scale. The groundwater table had a significant response to the irrigation events, thus the deep percolation was estimated using water-table fluctuation method (WTF). Results showed that during the two irrigation events of flowering and boiling stages, the total ET was 31.1 mm with the soil surface evaporation of only 0.4 mm. The total percolation of recharge to groundwater was 48.2 mm which contributed to the groundwater run-off of 22.1 mm. Transpiration of 30.7 mm accounted for 98.6% of the total ET of 31.1 mm and 34.3% of the irrigation water of 90.6 mm. Compared with transpiration, the deep percolation accounted for 53.2% of irrigation water, indicating a serious excessive irrigation that recharged to groundwater. Soil salt budget showed that the salt leached into groundwater was 1.56 times of the input from brackish irrigation water and fertilization during the two irrigation periods. Even for the irrigation practice with brackish water, the accumulated salt of soil profile could also be leached out under large amount of irrigation water (e.g. 90.6 mm for the two irrigation periods, 10 days). However, the waste of enormous water which for instance occupied 53.2% of the irrigation water in this study was not conducive to the sustainable utilization of water resources in the arid oasis. Furthermore, the methods introduced in this paper for ET and deep percolation calculation of cotton filed could be used to quantify the oasis hydrologic cycle of micro-irrigation, to gain a better understanding of the ecological process.

AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) is facing a water crisis under the dual impact of natural and anthropogenic factors. Groundwater levels have declined continuously since 1960, causing a series of environmental problems that have restricted sustainable development in the region. In the present study, we first utilized a previously developed 3D groundwater model to determine changes in groundwater level in the region over the past 50 years (1961-2010). We then applied grey relational analysis (GRA) to identify and ordinate major factors that have contributed to these changes. The results show an overall decreasing trend in groundwater levels in this region over the past 50 years and an increase in the water table depth at a rate of approximately 0.36 m/a. Groundwater exploitation showed the most significant correlation with the groundwater table decline, when compared with other factors including precipitation and river leakage. Therefore, human activities should be considered the primary force driving the groundwater level down. The results of this study have implications for developing criteria that consider changes in both climate and socio-economics. Furthermore, since the NCP is one of the most water-scarce and densely populated regions in the world, the analytical approach used in and the insights gained from this study are of international interest.

AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) is one of the global hotspots of groundwater depletion, groundwater is almost the only source of water for agricultural, industrial and drinking water in this region. After long-term's over-exploitation of deep groundwater, there appeared several deep groundwater depression cones, such as Cangzhou cone, Dezhou cone, Hengshui cone, Tianjin cone, etc., in which the Cangzhou cone is one of the typical cones for its special geography and hydrogeology conditions. In this study, the authors intended to analyze the evolution characteristics and influence factors of deep groundwater depression cone in Cangzhou region, especially the No. III aquifer depression cone, which is the main exploitation zone in this region. Analysis of the evolution of the groundwater depression cone of the No. III aquifer group in Cangzhou region showed that this process can be divided into four stages, namely, development, stable development, rapid expansion, and gradual recovery. The shape and evolution characteristics of the depression cone at different stages are described by analyzing the evolution of the -30, -40, and -50 contours of the groundwater table, for example the closed area of water table contour of -50 m has been enlarged from 95 km(2) in 1985 to 6 528.5 km(2) in 2005. The dominant factors that affect the evolution characteristics at different stages are proposed. The results showed that relatively long dry periods with less precipitation, special geological and hydrogeological conditions, and sharply increased water consumption for industrial and agricultural development are the main factors that cause the formation of deep groundwater depression cones. Meanwhile, an environmental response against groundwater exploitation is presented, and rational solutions are suggested to avert water crisis.

AB  - Sparse climatic observations represent a major challenge for hydrological modeling of mountain catchments with implications for decision-making in water resources management. Employing elevation bands in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SWAT2012-SUFI2) model enabled representation of precipitation and temperature variation with altitude in the Daning river catchment (Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China) where meteorological inputs are limited in spatial extent and are derived from observations from relatively low lying locations. Inclusion of elevation bands produced better model performance for 1987-1993 with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) increasing by at least 0.11 prior to calibration. During calibration prediction uncertainty was greatly reduced. With similar R-factors from the earlier calibration iterations, a further 11% of observations were included within the 95% prediction uncertainty (95PPU) compared to the model without elevation bands. For behavioral simulations defined in SWAT calibration using a NSE threshold of 0.3, an additional 3.9% of observations were within the 95PPU while the uncertainty reduced by 7.6% in the model with elevation bands. The calibrated model with elevation bands reproduced observed river discharges with the performance in the calibration period changing to "very good" from "poor" without elevation bands. The output uncertainty of calibrated model with elevation bands was satisfactory, having 85% of flow observations included within the 95PPU. These results clearly demonstrate the requirement to account for orographic effects on precipitation and temperature in hydrological models of mountainous catchments.

AB  - The upper fourth member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation (Es4s) is a typical example of a Bohai Bay Basin lacustrine shale. These sedimentary units are characterized by markedly different mineral compositions compared to marine siliciclastic shales. Thus, understanding the characteristics and sedimentary environment of lacustrine shales enables analysis of their origin, enrichment of organic matter (OM), distribution of organic rich shales, and exploration targets for shale oil and gas. Based on thin sections and field emission scanning electron microscope observations from well core samples, combined with X-ray diffraction and geochemistry, the mineralogy, lithofacies, organic and geochemical characteristics as well as the sedimentary environment of the Es4s shale are analyzed in this paper. The results show that, across the study area, the Es4s shale is mainly composed of calcite, clay minerals, and quartz, but also contains subordinate dolomite, feldspar, pyrite, and anhydrite. On the basis of mineral composition, total organic carbon (TOC) content and sedimentary structures, eight litho fades are identified. The TOC content of samples ranges between 0.15% and 11.4%, with an average of 2.27%, while OM primarily consists of Type I kerogen. Based on paleoclimate and paleosalinity data as well as redox conditions and primary productivity, the sedimentary environment of the Es4s shale can be further divided into four intervals: Intervals I, II, III, and IV, and these four intervals have large differences, rather than persistently warm-damp climate and reducing condition. The evolution of these intervals is also analyzed in detail in this study, and the controls on lithofacies and OM accumulation are also discussed. The results of this study suggest that the development of mineral compositions and frequent vertical lithofacies associations are strongly controlled by the cyclic evolution of the sedimentary environment. Thus, the accumulation of OM occurs as the result of a number of inter-connected factors including primary productivity, terrestrial inputs, and variation in oxidizing-reducing conditions. Across a given interval, these factors can either work together, or one can play a leading role.

AB  - Kinmen Island is a small, tectonically stable, granitic island that has been suffering from a scarcity of fresh water resources due to excessive annual evapotranspiration over annual precipitation. Recent studies further indicate that shallow (0-70 m) sedimentary aquifers, the major sources of groundwater supply, have already been over-exploited. Therefore, this preliminary study is to investigate the existence of exploitable water resources that can balance the shortage of fresh water on this island. Site characterization data are obtained from island-wide geophysical surveys as well as small-scale tests performed in a study area formed by three deep (maximum depth to 560 m) vertical boreholes installed in mid-east Kinmen northeast to Taiwu Mountain. Vertical fracture frequency data indicate that the rock body is fractured with a spatially correlated pattern, from which three major fracture zones (depths 0-70, 330-360, and below 450 m) can be identified. Geologic investigations indicate that the deepest fracture zone is caused by the large-scale, steeply dipping Taiwushan fault. This fault may have caused a laterally extensive low-resistivity zone, a potential fractured aquifer, near Taiwu Mountain. The middle fracture zone is induced by the Taiwushan fault and intersects the fault approximately 21 m southeast of the study area below a depth of 350 m. Slug testing results yield fracture transmissivity varying from 4.8 x 10(-7) to 2.2 x 10(-4) m(2)/s. Cross-hole tests have confirmed that hydraulic connectivity of the deeper rock body is controlled by the Taiwushan fault and the middle fracture zone. This connectivity may extend vertically to the sedimentary aquifers through high-angle joint sets. Despite the presence of a flow barrier formed by doleritic dike at about 300 m depth, the existence of fresh as well as meteoric water in the deeper rock body manifests that certain flow paths must exist through which the deeper fractured aquifers can be connected to the upper rock body. Therefore, groundwater stored within the Taiwushan fault and the associated low-resistivity zone can be considered as additional fresh water resources for future exploitation.

AB  - Kinmen Island is principally composed of low permeable granitoid and covered by a very thin sedimentary layer. Both surface and groundwater resources are limited and water demand is increasing with time. The groundwater in the granitoid has been surveyed as an alternative water source for daily use. Two to five highly fractured zones in the granitoid aquifer for each site were first determined by geochemical well logging. Accordingly, ten samples were collected from three sites. Using environmental isotopes and geochemical modeling, geochemical processes occurring due to water-rock interaction in the granitoid aquifer can be quantitatively interpreted. The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in groundwaters cluster along Taiwan's local meteoric waterline, indicating evaporation does not have considerable effect on groundwaters. Given such a high evaporation rate for Kinmen Island, this result implies that infiltration rate of groundwater is high enough to reduce retention time through a well-developed fracture zone. NetpathXL is employed for inverse geochemical modeling. Results determine gypsum as being the major source of sulfate for deep groundwaters. The contribution from pyrite is minor. In addition, the weathering of albite to kaolinite is the dominant water-rock interaction characterizing geochemical compositions of deep groundwater in Kinmen Island.

AB  - Water level monitoring provides essential information about the condition of aquifers and their responses to water extraction, land-use change, and climatic variability. It is important to have a spatially distributed, long-term monitoring well network for sustainable groundwater resource management. Community-based monitoring involving citizen scientists provides an approach to complement existing government-run monitoring programs. This article demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a large-scale water level monitoring network of private water supply wells using an example from Rocky View County (3900 km(2)) in Alberta, Canada. In this network, community volunteers measure the water level in their wells, and enter these data through a web-based data portal, which allows the public to view and download these data. The close collaboration among the university researchers, county staff members, and community volunteers enabled the successful implementation and operation of the network for a 5-year pilot period, which generated valuable data sets. The monitoring program was accompanied by education and outreach programs, in which the educational materials on groundwater were developed in collaboration with science teachers from local schools. The methodology used in this study can be easily adopted by other municipalities and watershed stewardship groups interested in groundwater monitoring. As governments are starting to rely increasingly on local municipalities and conservation authorities for watershed management and planning, community-based groundwater monitoring provides an effective and affordable tool for sustainable water resources management.

AB  - Kinmen is located in the south-west of Mainland China and mainly has two islands, Large Kinmen and Leiyu. Residents in Kinmen have drunk groundwater over several decades. This work characterized the quality of groundwater in Kinmen using factor analysis (FA), cluster analysis (CA) and geochemical simulation. The factor scores were plotted spatially to illustrate the groundwater quality and were used to discuss the grouped relationship using CA. Salinization, redox and organic matter factors are identified from 17 hydrochemical measurements in 18 wells. Acidic and oxidizing groundwater with nitrate-N pollution is distributed mainly in the west of Large Kinmen. Saline groundwater is distributed to the north-east of Large Kinmen and in the south of Leiyu. Groundwater with organic matter is present throughout Leiyu. Five groups of the groundwater quality divided by CA can be interpreted according to one to three factors. The grouped characteristics of the groundwater quality help the local government and industries to plan the use and protection of groundwater resources. Furthermore, a geochemical simulation was used to demonstrate the formation processes of the acidic and oxidizing groundwater properties in granitic sediments. A large amount of the precipitation of the kaolinite and magnetite releases concentrations of hydrogen ion and raises the redox potential in the aquifers. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This work adopted the geostatistical method, ordinary kriging, to determine the three-dimensional (3-D) spatial variability and distribution of hydraulic conductivity (K) in the Choushui River alluvial fan, Taiwan. The spatial distributions of estimated K obtained using two 3-D estimation approaches, including the non-stratified estimation and the stratified estimation, were statistically evaluated. Moreover, the vertical (small-scale) and horizontal (large-scale) variations were anisotroplcally analyzed and their relationship to the hydrogeological formation of aquifers was examined. A cross-validation procedure indicates that the realization of the non-stratified estimation yields fewer estimated errors than the stratified estimation. The directions of maximum continuity for horizontal K variability of all aquifers range from N60degreesW to N105degreesW, and are consistent with the current flow direction of the rivers and the ancient river shift in the Choushui River alluvial fan. The anisotropic analysis indicates that the hydrogeological parameters, of the aquifers are spatially correlated with the formation environment of the Choushui River.

AB  - Kinmen is located in the southwest of Mainland China. Groundwater supplies 50% of the domestic water use on the island. Residents of Kinmen drink groundwater over the long term because surface water resources are limited. Nitrate-N pollution is found and distributed primarily in the western part of groundwater aquifer whereas saline groundwater is distributed to the northeastern Kinmen. This work applied the DRASTIC model to construct the vulnerability map of Kinmen groundwater. MT3D was then used to evaluate the contamination potential of nitrate-N. The health risk associated with the ingestion of nitrate-N contaminated groundwater is also assessed. The results from DRASTIC model showed that the upland crop and grass land have high contamination potential, whereas the forest, reservoir and housing land have low contamination potential. The calibrated MT3D model inversely determined the high strength sources (0.09-2.74 kg/m(2)/year) of nitrate contaminant located in the west to the north west area and required 2-5 years travel time to reach the monitoring wells. Simulated results of MT3D also showed that both the continuous and instantaneous contaminant sources of nitrate-N release may cause serious to moderate nitrate contamination in the western Kinmen and jeopardize the domestic use of groundwater. The chronic health hazard quotient (HQ) associated with the potential non-carcinogenic risk of drinking nitrate-N contaminated groundwater showed that the assessed 95th percentile of HQ is 2.74, indicating that exposure to waterborne nitrate poses a potential non-cancer risk to the residents of the island. Corrective measures, including protecting groundwater recharge zones and reducing the number of agricultural and non-agricultural nitrogen sources that enters the aquifer, should be implemented especially in the western part of Kinmen to assure a sustainable use of groundwater resources.

AB  - Groundwater supplies over 50 % of drinking water in Kinmen. Approximately 16.8 % of groundwater samples in Kinmen exceed the drinking water quality standard (DWQS) of NO3 (-)-N (10 mg/L). The residents drinking high nitrate-polluted groundwater pose a potential risk to health. To formulate effective water quality management plan and assure a safe drinking water in Kinmen, the detailed spatial distribution of nitrate-N in groundwater is a prerequisite. The aim of this study is to develop an efficient scheme for evaluating spatial distribution of nitrate-N in residential well water using logistic regression (LR) model. A probability-based nitrate-N contamination map in Kinmen is constructed. The LR model predicted the binary occurrence probability of groundwater nitrate-N concentrations exceeding DWQS by simple measurement variables as independent variables, including sampling season, soil type, water table depth, pH, EC, DO, and Eh. The analyzed results reveal that three statistically significant explanatory variables, soil type, pH, and EC, are selected for the forward stepwise LR analysis. The total ratio of correct classification reaches 92.7 %. The highest probability of nitrate-N contamination map presents in the central zone, indicating that groundwater in the central zone should not be used for drinking purposes. Furthermore, a handy EC-pH-probability curve of nitrate-N exceeding the threshold of DWQS was developed. This curve can be used for preliminary screening of nitrate-N contamination in Kinmen groundwater. This study recommended that the local agency should implement the best management practice strategies to control nonpoint nitrogen sources and carry out a systematic monitoring of groundwater quality in residential wells of the high nitrate-N contamination zones.

AB  - A series of changes in groundwater systems caused by groundwater exploitation in energy base have been of great concern to hydrogeologists. The research aims to identify the origin and geochemical evolution of groundwater in the Subei Lake basin under the influence of human activities. Water samples were collected, and major ions and stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta D) were analyzed. In terms of hydrogeological conditions and the analytical results of hydrochemical data, groundwater can be classified into three types: the Quaternary groundwater, the shallow Cretaceous groundwater and the deep Cretaceous groundwater. Piper diagram and correlation analysis were used to reveal the hydrochemical characteristics of water resources. The dominant water type of the lake water was Cl-Na type, which was in accordance with hydrochemical characteristics of inland salt lakes; the predominant hydrochemical types for groundwater were HCO3-Ca, HCO3-Na and mixed HCO3-Ca-Na-Mg types. The groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by dissolution/precipitation of anhydrite, gypsum, halite and calcite. The dedolomitization and cation exchange are also important factors. Rock weathering is confirmed to play a leading role in the mechanisms responsible for the chemical composition of groundwater. The stable isotopic values of oxygen and hydrogen in groundwater are close to the local meteoric water line, indicating that groundwater is of modern local meteoric origin. Unlike significant differences in isotopic values between shallow groundwater and deep groundwater in the Habor Lake basin, shallow Cretaceous groundwater and deep Cretaceous groundwater have similar isotopic characteristics in the Subei Lake basin. Due to the evaporation effect and dry climatic conditions, heavy isotopes are more enriched in lake water than in groundwater. The low slope of the regression line of delta O-18 and delta D in lake water could be ascribed to a combination of mixing and evaporation under conditions of low humidity. Comparison of the regression line for delta O-18 and delta D showed that lake water in the Subei Lake basin contains more heavily isotopic composition than that in the Habor Lake basin, indicating that lake water in the discharge area has undergone stronger evaporation than lake water in the recharge area. Hydrochemical and isotopic information of utmost importance has been provided to decision makers by the present study so that a sustainable groundwater management strategy can be designed for the Ordos energy base.

AB  - Over-exploitation of groundwater in North China Plain (NCP) has resulted in a series of eco-environment problems. Sustainable use of groundwater resources in NCP, in particular management of groundwater resource carrying capacity (GRCC), faces an unprecedented challenge. Here we define GRCC, and a new assessment method is tentatively proposed and applied to evaluate GRCC based on the whole NCP, city administrative units and county administrative units. Our study divided the NCP into three zones, i.e. non-overexploited non-overloaded zone (NNZ), overexploited but non-overloaded zone (ONZ), and overexploited overloaded zone (OOZ). Results confirmed 27.6% of counties belonged to NNZ. However, 58.9% of counties and NCP as a whole belonged to ONZ, and 13.5% of counties belonged to OOZ. Spatially, NNZs were mainly distributed in Beijing, parts of eastern coastal cities and Henan Province. OOZs were mostly distributed in middle-eastern part of Cangzhou, parts of Dezhou, Tianjin and Binzhou, and the remaining areas belonged to ONZs. We suggest two approaches for enhancing GRCC, i) increasing the amount of available groundwater and ii) improving the water use efficiency. An increase of 11.0 billion cubic meters to the available groundwater levels combined with water use efficiency improvements up to 479 CNY per cubic meter of the world mean, the gross domestic product (GDP) sustained by groundwater in the NCP could reach 11.1 trillion CNY and maintain a 20 years of GDP development assuming the current rate of growth.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss historical and recent land subsidence in the Modern Yellow River Delta. Integrated analysis of leveling and relevant background data, including groundwater level, oil extraction, and geological structure, has revealed that land displacement is driven by natural and induced components acting at various depths. Since the 1950s, intense settlements occurred in the modern estuary delta lobes. Between 2002 and 2008, the subsidence center of Dongying and Guangrao exhibited a typical subsidence area with subsidence rates of 28.2 and 64.7 mm/years, respectively. Higher magnitudes are associated with groundwater withdrawals and oil-gas field exploitations, which induce the compaction of a deep clayey layer. There existed a significant linear positive correlation between groundwater level and elevation in the center of the deep groundwater depression cone. The major contributor of natural subsidence is tectonic movements, while moderate sinking due to the natural consolidation of the recent delta subsoil is still acting.

AB  - In decision-making processes, reliability and risk aversion play a decisive role. The aim of this study is to perform an uncertainty assessment of the effects of future scenarios of sustainable groundwater pumping strategies on the quantitative and chemical status of an aquifer. The good status of the aquifer is defined according to the terms established by the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). A decision support systems (DSS) is presented, which makes use of a stochastic inverse model (GC method) and geostatistical approaches to calibrate equally likely realizations of hydraulic conductivity (K) fields for a particular case study. These K fields are conditional to available field data, including hard and soft information. Then, different future scenarios of groundwater pumping strategies are generated, based on historical information and WFD standards, and simulated for each one of the equally likely K fields. The future scenarios lead to different environmental impacts and levels of socioeconomic development of the region and, hence, to a different degree of acceptance among stakeholders. We have identified the different stakeholders implied in the decision-making process, the objectives pursued and the alternative actions that should be considered by stakeholders in a public participation project (PPP). The MonteCarlo simulation provides a highly effective way for uncertainty assessment and allows presenting the results in a simple and understandable way even for non-experts stakeholders. The methodology has been successfully applied to a real case study and lays the foundations to performa PPP and stakeholders' involvement in a decisionmaking process as required by the WFD. The results of the methodology can help the decision-making process to come up with the best policies and regulations for a groundwater system under uncertainty in groundwater parameters and management strategies and involving stakeholders with conflicting interests.

AB  - The roles of cooperation and non-cooperation in the sustainable exploitation of a jointly used groundwater resource have been quantified mathematically using an analytical game-theoretic formulation. Cooperative equilibrium arises when groundwater users respect water-level constraints and consider mutual impacts, which allows them to derive economic benefits from ground-water indefinitely, that is, to achieve sustainability. This work shows that cooperative equilibrium can be obtained from the solution of a quadratic programming problem. For cooperative equilibrium to hold, however, enforcement must be effective. Otherwise, according to the commonized costs-privatized profits paradox, there is a natural tendency towards non-cooperation and non-sustainable aquifer mining, of which overdraft is a typical symptom. Non-cooperative behavior arises when at least one ground-water user neglects the externalities of his adopted ground-water pumping strategy. In this instance, water-level constraints may be violated in a relatively short time and the economic benefits from ground-water extraction fall below those obtained with cooperative aquifer use. One example illustrates the game theoretic approach of this work. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Long-term time series data of aquifer recharge, groundwater extraction, and discharge are used to estimate aquifer storage capacity and maximum annual yield. Aquifer storage capacity is defined as the maximum volume of water that can be stored in an aquifer. It is estimated using a transient water-balance approach. The maximum annual yield is defined as the maximum combined groundwater extraction plus discharge that can be sustained in an aquifer judged by the historical record of recharge. It is determined according to a graphical mass-curve method. These two quantities are useful in aquifer characterization and groundwater management, the apportionment of groundwater rights and aquifer storage and recovery operations being two frequent applications. Time series data from the Edwards Aquifer, Texas, USA, illustrate the application of the methods presented.

AB  - Well-designed public policy stimulates social progress. However, when governments translate political vision into programmes for social change, the complexity of issues can overwhelm the policy-making process, creating disappointment and suboptimal outcomes. In this paper we examine why evidence-based policy-making approaches often fail to provide policy-makers with credible, consistent and clear outcomes matching broad social interest. The need for public policy primarily arises from a lack of perfect knowledge, which causes individuals and agencies to behave in ways that counter social interest. We therefore suggest that effective public policy formulation involves: determining what evidence is available, relevant and useful; as well as identifying critical gaps to making public policy necessary and meaningful. Murray-Darling Basin case examples highlight key stages in effective natural resource policy formulation, and sources of difficulties that need to be managed to maximize scientific contributions. These examples show that effective public policy decisions can still be made and information asymmetry managed via strong evidence, expert analysis to verify that evidence, and an understanding of knowledge gaps such that critical interventions can be agreed upon and objectives achieved in view of how they will be managed and resourced. Finally, we draw attention to the opportunities available and challenges that exist for hydrologists, economists and other social scientists to work together in assisting the policy process, and in particular to minimize the burden of information constraints in making effective water resource policy.

AB  - Understanding groundwater systems is crucial to ensure their monitoring and protection. Global groundwater models and predictive tools exist to better understand them. In view of scarce groundwater data, especially in developing countries, the question of how to model these systems and make them usable for groundwater management is crucial. Herein, we demonstrate how a transdisciplinary process can overcome the data scarcity problem and lead to the development of a local groundwater balance model (LGBM). Over 50 actors from more than 15 disciplines and groundwater-related sectors were involved for the case of Yucatan, Mexico. Results revealed high wastewater emissions to the aquifer discharged without treatment and poor recycling practices. The method can be adapted to specific regions, can be used to address methodological challenges for monitoring, and can contribute to the achievement of the 2030 Development Agenda by addressing Sustainable Development Goal 6-related Targets (6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6(a, b)).

AB  - Groundwater is one of the largest and most important sources of fresh water on many regions under Mediterranean climate conditions, which are exposed to large precipitation variability that includes frequent meteorological drought episodes, and present high evapotranspiration rates and water demand during the dry season. The dependence on groundwater increases in those areas with predominant permeable lithologies, contributing to aquifer recharge and the abundance of ephemeral streams. The increasing pressure of tourism on water resources in many Mediterranean coastal areas, and uncertainty related to future precipitation and water availability, make it urgent to understand the spatio-temporal response of groundwater bodies to precipitation variability, if sustainable use of the resource is to be achieved. We present an assessment of the response of aquifers to precipitation variability based on correlations between the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at various time scales and the Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI) across a Mediterranean island. We detected three main responses of aquifers to accumulated precipitation anomalies: (i) at short time scales of the SPI (<6 months); (ii) at medium time scales (6-24 months); and at long time scales (>24 months). The differing responses were mainly explained by differences in lithology and the percentage of highly permeable rock strata in the aquifer recharge areas. We also identified differences in the months and seasons when aquifer storages are more dependent on precipitation; these were related to climate seasonality and the degree of aquifer exploitation or underground water extraction. The recharge of some aquifers, especially in mountainous areas, is related to precipitation variability within a limited spatial extent, whereas for aquifers located in the plains, precipitation variability influence much larger areas; the topography and geological structure of the island explain these differences. Results indicate large spatial variability in the response of aquifers to precipitation in a very small area, highlighting the importance of having high spatial resolution hydro-climatic databases available to enable full understanding of the effects of climate variability on scarce water resources.

AB  - How lake systems are maintained and water is balanced in the lake areas in the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD), northeast of China have been debated for about a decade. In this study, continuous Rn-222 measurement is used to quantify groundwater discharge into two representative fresh and brine water lakes in the desert using a steady-state mass-balance model. Two empirical equations are used to calculate atmospheric evasion loss crossing the water-air interface of the lakes. Groundwater discharge rates yielded from the radon mass balance model based on the two empirical equations are well correlated and of almost the same values, confirming the validity of the model. The fresh water and brine lakes have a daily averaged groundwater discharge rate of 7.6 +/- 1.7 mm d(-1) and 6.4 +/- 1.8 mm d(-1), respectively. The temporal fluctuations of groundwater discharge show similar patterns to those of the lake water level, suggesting that the lakes are recharged from nearby groundwater. Assuming that all the lakes have the same discharge rate as the two studied lakes, total groundwater discharge into all the lakes in the desert is estimated to be 1.59 x 10(5) m(3) d(-1). A conceptual model of water balance within a desert lake catchment is proposed to characterize water behaviors within the catchment. This study sheds lights on the water balance in the BJD and is of significance in sustainable regional water resource utilization in such an ecologically fragile area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Groundwater is increasingly relied on as a source of potable water in developing countries, but factors such as population growth, development, and climate variability, pose potential challenges for ongoing sustainable supply. The effect of these factors on the groundwater system was considered in four scenarios using a numerical model to represent the Bani area of Mali, West Africa. By 2040, population growth, climate variability, and development as urbanization, agriculture, and industry creates scenarios in which groundwater extraction is an increasingly larger percentage of the groundwater system. Consumption from agriculture and industry increases extraction rates from less than 1 to 3.8% of mean annual precipitation, which will likely affect the groundwater system. For instance, concentrated pumping in local areas may result in water level declines. The results of this study contribute to an ongoing evaluation of sustainable groundwater resources in West Africa.

At both locations, delta values were greatly affected by seasonal climatic conditions and a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between delta and P. In Mali, a statistically significant negative correlation was also observed between delta and V (p). There was no statistically significant correlation between delta and T. Mean-weighting of delta values may be masking both dry-season and individual storm event precipitation phenomena, which are otherwise observed in arithmetically averaged delta values. Mean monthly d values for peak monsoonal months indicate that precipitation is first-fraction, gaining little recycled water on its journey inland from the Atlantic Ocean near the equator. Agreement between rainy-season precipitation and groundwater delta values, specifically peak monsoonal months, indicates that groundwater is being recharged by infiltration of current monsoonal rains and is not paleo-groundwater recharged under past climatic conditions. Similarity between rainy-season precipitation and groundwater d values provide another indication that monsoonal precipitation under current climatic conditions is the source of groundwater recharge. The knowledge that groundwater is recently recharged monsoonal rains, rather than paleo-groundwater, is important for evaluating groundwater sustainability and the effects that climate change will have on water resources. Understanding and predicting changes in precipitation amounts and intensities, which ultimately affect timing and amount of groundwater recharge, is critical for water resource management.

AB  - As Egypt's population increases, the demand for fresh groundwater extraction will intensify. Consequently, the groundwater quality will deteriorate, including an increase in salinization. On the other hand, salinization caused by saltwater intrusion in the coastal Nile Delta Aquifer (NDA) is also threatening the groundwater resources. The aim of this article is to assess the situation in 2010 (since this is when most data is sufficiently available) regarding the available fresh groundwater resources and to evaluate future salinization in the NDA using a 3D variable-density groundwater flow model coupled with salt transport that was developed with SEAWAT. This is achieved by examining six future scenarios that combine two driving forces: increased extraction and sea level rise (SLR). Given the prognosis of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), the scenarios are used to assess the impact of groundwater extraction versus SLR on the seawater intrusion in the Delta and evaluate their contributions to increased groundwater salinization. The results show that groundwater extraction has a greater impact on salinization of the NDA than SLR, while the two factors combined cause the largest reduction of available fresh groundwater resources. The significant findings of this research are the determination of the groundwater volumes of fresh water, brackish, light brackish and saline water in the NDA as a whole and in each governorate and the identification of the governorates that are most vulnerable to salinization. It is highly recommended that the results of this analysis are considered in future mitigation and/or adaptation plans.

AB  - In 2014, California passed legislation requiring the sustainable management of critically overdrafted groundwater basins, located primarily in the Central Valley agricultural region. Hydroeconomic modeling of the agricultural economy, groundwater, and surface water systems is critically important to simulate potential transition paths to sustainable management of the basins. The requirement for sustainable groundwater use by 2040 is mandated for many overdrafted groundwater basins that are decoupled from environmental and river flow effects. We argue that, for such cases, a modeling approach that integrates a biophysical response function from a hydrologic model into an economic model of groundwater use is preferable to embedding an economic response function in a complex hydrologic model as is more commonly done. Using this preferred approach, we develop a dynamic hydroeconomic model for the Kings and Tulare Lake subbasins of California and evaluate three groundwater management institutionsopen access, perfect foresight, and managed pumping. We quantify the costs and benefits of sustainable groundwater management, including energy pumping savings, drought reserve values, and avoided capital costs. Our analysis finds that, for basins that are severely depleted, losses in crop net revenue are offset by the benefits of energy savings, drought reserve value, and avoided capital costs. This finding provides an empirical counterexample to the Gisser and Sanchez Effect.

AB  - The protection of ecosystems associated with groundwater, and thus potentially vulnerable to groundwater exploitation, is only now being recognised as an important aspect of water management. Although there has been a gradual increase in scientific understanding of the links between groundwater availability and ecosystem health, a significant challenge remains in the development and implementation of policy that adequately addresses the protection of groundwater-dependent ecosystems. There is no single right way to solve the problem of protecting groundwater-dependent ecosystems, while still allowing the use of groundwater to support social and economic development, poverty alleviation and improved food and water security. This paper provides a global perspective in examining the potential impacts of the lack of policy, or poor implementation of policy, related to groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and discusses emerging approaches in this field. The following two important factors are considered in the paper: first, the difficulty of managing typically local- and regional-scale problems associated with groundwater exploitation, by using national-scale policy interventions and regulation; second, the need to shorten the cycle from science to policy and regulation, and thence to management activities on the ground, in order to encourage policy shifts in the short to medium term that better reflect the available scientific knowledge of groundwater-dependent ecosystems.

AB  - Beneficiaries of common pool resources (CPRs) may select available noncooperative and regulatory exogenous institutions for managing the resource, as well as cooperative management institutions. All these institutions may increase the long-term gains, prolong the life of the resource, and help to escape the tragedy of the commons trap. Cooperative game theory approaches can serve as the backbone of cooperative CPR management institutions. This paper formulates and applies several commonly used cooperative game theoretic solution concepts, namely, the core, Nash-Harsanyi, Shapley, and nucleolus. Through a numerical groundwater example, we show how CPR users can share the gains obtained from cooperation in a fair and efficient manner based on these cooperative solution concepts (management institutions). Although, based on their fairness rationales, various cooperative management institutions may suggest different allocations that are potentially acceptable to the users, these allocation solutions may not be stable as some users may find them unfair. This paper discusses how different methods, such as application of the plurality rule and power index, stability index, and propensity to disrupt concepts, can help identify the most stable and likely solutions for enforcing cooperation among the CPR beneficiaries. Furthermore, how the noncooperative managerial characteristics of the CPR users can affect the stability and acceptability of the different cooperative CPR management institutions is discussed, providing valuable policy insights for cooperative CPR management at community levels.

AB  - With the increasing competition for fresh water, there is a growing reliance on the abstraction of groundwater for irrigated agriculture. Groundwater irrigation demand has been growing steadily over the past decades, for many reasons including the unreliability of the traditional large canal schemes, and the increasing need of farmers to manage their own irrigation applications. In addition, unpredictability in climate has forced some farmers, particularly in semi-arid areas, to exploit groundwater, in order to combat drought. The increasing overexploitation of important aquifers around the world, as well as groundwater contamination must be of concern to water resource planners and managers. Groundwater is a finite resource, and little is being done to accurately map, assess, monitor and regulate groundwater development for agriculture. Unconstrained and unregulated groundwater development is already impacting negatively on agricultural growth in over 111 million ha of irrigated lands, and innumerable livelihoods that rely on groundwater. Any attenuation of growth will make it more difficult to feed 9 billion people by 2050. A more proactive and integrated approach to groundwater governance, management and protection, built upon sound technical, institutional, legal, socio-economic and environmental principles is required.

AB  - Investigations are carried out to analyze the effect of freshwater pumping on saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers in the presence of a semipervious subsurface barrier along the coast. A conceptual, unconfined aquifer with a subsurface barrier subjected to simultaneous freshwater pumping at single/multiple locations perpendicular to the coast is considered for the analysis. The location, width, and the conductivity of the subsurface barrier being held constant, the effect of freshwater pumping at seaward and landward locations from the barrier is investigated on the interface motion. The performance of the barrier is compared with a nonbarrier condition. The numerical model developed predicts the behavior of the saltwater-freshwater interface and the piezometric surface due to simultaneous pumping at single/multiple wells across the sea cost. The barrier is effective in checking the progress of saltwater for freshwater pumping on the landward side of the barrier compared to no barrier condition. The freshwater pumping on the seaward side of the barrier should be limited to smaller rates. Additionally, safer zones for simultaneous freshwater withdrawal are identified for single, two, three, and four wells without the advancement of saltwater intrusion. The results obtained are of general nature and would be useful in determining the ideal location and rate of freshwater withdrawal minimizing the saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers.

AB  - Ground water resource management programs are paying increasing attention to the integration of ground water and surface water in the planning process. Many plans, however, show a sophistication in approach and presentation that masks a fundamental weakness in the overall analysis. The plans usually discuss issues of demand and yield, yet never directly address a fundamental issue behind the plan-how to define sustainable yield of an aquifer system. This paper points out a number of considerations that must be addressed in defining sustainable yield in order to make the definition more useful in practical water resource planning studies. These include consideration for the spatial and temporal aspects of the problem, the development of a conceptual water balance, the influence of boundaries and changes in technology on the definition, the need to examine water demand as well as available supply, the need for stakeholder involvement, and the issue of uncertainty in our understanding of the components of the hydrologic system.

AB  - Groundwater pumping and surface water management structures, i.e. dams and water flow diversions, have been raising serious concerns about the declines in groundwater levels and streamflow in different watersheds throughout the world. Small island watersheds with complex land use, and strong spatio-temporal climate and edaphic variability (e.g. Hawaiian watersheds) offer an ideal environment to help improve our understanding of groundwater-surface water interaction and the hydrological processes it involves. In this study, we investigate the spatio-temporal relationships between streamflow, rainfall, and groundwater using long-term (>40 years) data records from a small Hawaiian watershed. A suite of Mann-Kendall tests were used to evaluate trends and shifts in time series data. The impact of groundwater pumping in the valley on streamflow was also investigated; multiple linear regression analysis was used to quantify the effect of pumping on streamflow. Stream base flow and total flow have declined significantly since 1960, while rainfall showed no statistically significant trends since the 1960s. Groundwater pumping has significantly increased since 1960, and our findings indicate it is a significant contributing factor to streamflow decline. Watershed yield experienced two successive downward shifts: first around 1971-1972 and then again around 1991-1992. The first downward shift appears to be related to the pumping of groundwater from the mid-valley area which began in 1968. The second downward shift is the result of pumping in the upper valley, which began in 1991. Regression models and double mass curve analyses indicate that pumping may have captured significant amounts of groundwater that otherwise would have comprised stream base flow. Streamflow has been reduced by 19-22% since 1971 and as much as 36% since 1991. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estimates of groundwater recharge spatial and temporal variability are essential inputs to groundwater flow models that are used to test groundwater availability under different management and climate conditions. In this study, a soil water balance analysis was conducted to estimate groundwater recharge on the island of Jeju, Korea, for baseline, drought, and climate-land use change scenarios. The Soil Water Balance (SWB) computer code was used to compute groundwater recharge and other water balance components at a daily time step using a 100 m grid cell size for an 18-year baseline scenario (1992-2009). A 10-year drought scenario was selected from historical precipitation trends (1961-2009), while the climate-land use change scenario was developed using late 21st century climate projections and a change in urban land use. Mean annual recharge under the baseline, drought, and climate-land use scenarios was estimated at 884,591, and 788 mm, respectively. Under the baseline scenario, mean annual recharge was within the range of previous estimates (825-959 mm) and only slightly lower than the mean of 902 mm. As a fraction of mean annual rainfall, mean annual recharge was computed as only 42% and less than previous estimates of 44-48%. The maximum historical reported annual pumping rate of 241 x 10(6) m(3) equates to 15% of baseline recharge, which is within the range of 14-16% computed from earlier studies. The model does not include a mechanism to account for additional sources of groundwater recharge, such as fog drip, irrigation, and artificial recharge, and may also overestimate evapotranspiration losses. Consequently, the results presented in this study represent a conservative estimate of total recharge. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thirty percent of present industrial water consumption of the Golgohar Iron Ore Mine (GIOM) is supplied from a hard rock well (PW-A15) and the rest from 25 wells located in 4 disconnected alluvial aquifers. This well is drilled in the metamorphic complex of Golgohar formation. Attempts have been made to develop extraction of water from other hard rocks existing in the area with no success. Therefore, extensive researches have been carried out to find the pathway, or a provision pathway of water discharged from this well. To study the hydrochemical similarity of this water with other water resources, 122 water samples from an area of 7132 km(2) were collected from the existing pumping wells, piezometers, mine exploration bore holes, and three salt pans in the vicinity of the area for hydrochemical analysis. The analyses were performed for concentration of major ions and some minor elements. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of ion concentration was plotted in the GIS to delineate the similarity of the PW-A15 water with other water sources and their hydrochemical neighborhood by analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The AHP was performed in two steps: first, iso-concentration maps of seven major ions, eight minor elements, and TDS were used to produce an AHP map (Map1) using weights for different hydrochemical parameters; and second, a similarity index (SI) map was prepared by performing a suggested clustering approach in SPSS using K-means clustering, which was overlaid on Map1 producing Map2. The result of AHP Map2 was then overlaid on the iso-potential map of the sampled locations in GIS software using a mask operator. Therefore, the zones having the most similarity and higher hydraulic potential than PW-A15 were nominated as the zones which possibly could recharge this well, and the groundwater (GW) pathway was proposed. The result of the study method showed to be successful and will be used as a guide for future exploration drillings.

AB  - A qualitative and quantitative monitoring of groundwater discharge was conducted based on an airborne thermal campaign undertaken along the north-western coast of the Dead Sea in January 2011 to contribute to the relatively scarce information on groundwater discharge to date in the region. The application of airborne thermal data exploits thermal contrasts that exist between discharging groundwater and background sea surface temperatures of the Dead Sea. Using these contrasts, 72 discharge sites were identified from which only 42 were known from previous in situ measurements undertaken at terrestrial springs by the Israel Hydrological Service. Six of these sites represent submarine springs and at a further 24 locations groundwater appears to seep through the sediment. Although the abundance of groundwater seepage sites suggests a significant, but so far unknown groundwater source, the main contribution appears to originate from terrestrial springs. In an attempt to provide a quantitative approach for terrestrial springs, a linear bootstrap regression model between in situ spring discharge and respective thermal discharge plumes (r(2) = 0.87 p < 0.001) is developed and presented here. While the results appear promising and could potentially be applied to derive discharge values at unmonitored sites, several influence factors need to be clarified before a robust and reliable model to efficiently derive a complete quantitative picture of groundwater discharge can be proposed.

AB  - The seasonal and annual nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) budgets of the mesotidal Ria Formosa lagoon, southern Portugal, were estimated to reveal the main inputs and outputs, the seasonal patterns, and how they may influence the ecological functioning of the system. The effects of extreme weather events such as long-lasting strong winds causing upwelling and strong rainfall were assessed. External nutrient inputs were quantified; ocean exchange was assessed in 24-h sampling campaigns, and final calculations were made using a hydrodynamic model of the lagoon. Rain and stream inputs were the main freshwater sources to the lagoon. However, wastewater treatment plant and groundwater discharges dominated nutrient input, together accounting for 98, 96, and 88 % of total C, N, and P input, respectively. Organic matter and nutrients were continuously exported to the ocean. This pattern was reversed following extreme events, such as strong winds in early summer that caused upwelling and after a period of heavy rainfall in late autumn. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that ammonium and organic N and C exchange were positively associated with temperature as opposed to pH and nitrate. These variables reflected mostly the benthic lagoon metabolism, whereas particulate P exchange was correlated to Chl a, indicating that this was more related to phytoplankton dynamics. The increase of stochastic events, as expected in climate change scenarios, may have strong effects on the ecological functioning of coastal lagoons, altering the C and nutrient budgets.

AB  - Strategic management of degrading coastal aquifers in eastern North Carolina (USA) became imperative after a severe imbalance occurred between withdrawal and recharge rates. To ameliorate this growing problem, an aggressive water policy was developed through public input by creating the Central Coastal Plain Capacity Use Area (CCPCUA) to maintain beneficial use of groundwater resources. Insights from social psychology, and socio-legal studies are used to evaluate how procedural justice and public participation played major roles to resolving groundwater resource management problems. A mixed methods approach uses archival data and interviews with various rule-making participants to assess the process of stakeholder involvement that led to creation of the policy. In addition, data analysis techniques are utilized to evaluate the effects of the policy on aquifer health (through water levels) over a similar to 10 year period. Results suggest that not only did a stakeholder group participate in a process that was deemed fair, understandable, and relatively easy to administer for users and regulators, but public participation resulted in an effective plan that ensures the long-term sustainable use of groundwater. Declining groundwater withdrawals and recovering water levels suggest that the rule is achieving its intended goal of protecting the aquifers from depletion and degradation. This paper touches on global themes that are essential to water demand and consumption, water management techniques, and water resources protection.

AB  - Water supply reliability in Southern California is facing serious problems because of reduction in the availability of water from the State Water Project and Colorado River, drought, and growing concerns about environmental restoration. Groundwater sources supply more than fifty-five percent of domestic demands in the Western Riverside County. Western Municipal Water District is planning to increase water supply reliability by expanding the Arlington Desalter production which requires additional groundwater pumping from the Arlington Basin. Western was concerned that increasing groundwater pumping will cause excessive decline in groundwater levels, leading to decreased yields at existing Desalter wells. Three-dimensional groundwater flow model was developed for the Arlington Basin to investigate different water management strategies. Five groundwater management scenarios were run for a 30-year time period. The five model runs were used to determine the feasibility of the Arlington aquifer system to supply groundwater to the Arlington Desalter over the 30-year life of the facility. Model simulation results showed that long-term groundwater pumping from the existing Desalter wells is not sustainable without artificial recharge. However two of the modeling scenarios which incorporated a combination of artificial recharge and new production wells, were shown to meet the increased Desalter yield requirements as well as minimize adverse impacts.

AB  - A conjunctive-use model is developed for management of groundwater and surface water resources via mixed integer linear fractional programming (MILFP). The objective of the conjunctive-use model is to maximize the ratio of groundwater usage to surface water usage through a water supply network. A conditional head constraint is imposed to the conjunctive-use model to maintain aquifer sustainability. A transformation approach is introduced to transform the conditional head constraint into a set of mixed integer linear constraints in terms of groundwater head. Groundwater head is further linearized with respect to pumping rates that are decision variables. Eventually, the conjunctive-use model is to solve a successive MILFP problem by updating the response matrix in each iteration. To make an MILFP problem tractable, the study develops a transformation technique along with the Charnes-Cooper transformation approach to transform an MILFP problem into an equivalent problem of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to be solved by CPLEX. The proposed conjunctive-use model is applied to northern Louisiana. A water supply network is proposed to utilize four existing reservoirs as alternative resources in order to raise groundwater level in the Sparta aquifer to acceptable target level in Ouachita, Lincoln, and Union Parishes while maximizing groundwater pumping. The results show that the conjunctive-use management framework increases groundwater levels by an average of 6.96m (22.82ft) from 2001 to 2010 by reducing total groundwater withdrawal 28.93%, which is counterbalanced by reservoir water.

AB  - Effective management of water resources requires signaling the scarcity value of water to society. However, accurate signaling is often limited by incomplete and/or untimely accounting of hydrologic stores and flows of water. In this opinion piece, we advocate an incisive yet conceptually simple framework for transparent, real-time accounting of water stores and flows, including both groundwater and surface water, to inform water markets organized around a central clearinghouse. This framework promotes forthright collaboration among disciplines to improve system efficiency and increase water-management transparency. We use California water management as an example for the potential for a central clearinghouse framework that has proven so beneficial to transparency of energy markets in that region.

AB  - A fundamental knowledge of processes that control groundwater composition is required for informed management of water quality. The Voronka groundwater body in northeastern Estonia represents a good example of a complicated, overexploited groundwater system where conceptual understanding of baseline quality and governing hydrogeochemical processes can support sustainable aquifer management. A conceptual understanding or conceptual model is a simplified representation or a working understanding of the real hydrogeological system and its processes. The baseline chemical composition of the Voronka groundwater body was formed during the last glaciations, when glacial meltwater intruded into water-bearing rocks. Two main processes that can change Voronka groundwater body quality at the present day are: (1) seawater intrusion and (2) water exchange between buried valleys and formation's groundwater. Future monitoring and management should focus on changes in the natural composition of groundwater caused by abstraction. The HCO3-/Cl- value is the best parameter to describe the fluctuations in natural background chemistry in the Voronka groundwater body and to assess significant trends induced by abstraction. In case of the discovered trends, a suite of isotope methods, especially C-14, H-3, delta H-2, delta O-18 and delta C-13, can be used to detect whether the intrusion of seawater or exchange of water with buried valleys is taking place.

AB  - Salt flat brines are a major source of minerals and especially lithium. Moreover, valuable wetlands with delicate ecologies are also commonly present at the margins of salt flats. Therefore, the efficient and sustainable exploitation of the brines they contain requires detailed knowledge about the hydrogeology of the system. A critical issue is the freshwater-brine mixing zone, which develops as a result of the mass balance between the recharged freshwater and the evaporating brine. The complex processes occurring in salt flats require a three-dimensional (3D) approach to assess the mixing zone geometry. In this study, a 3D map of the mixing zone in a salt flat is presented, using the Salar de Atacama as an example. This mapping procedure is proposed as the basis of computationally efficient three-dimensional numerical models, provided that the hydraulic heads of freshwater and mixed waters are corrected based on their density variations to convert them into brine heads. After this correction, the locations of lagoons and wetlands that are characteristic of the marginal zones of the salt flats coincide with the regional minimum water (brine) heads. The different morphologies of the mixing zone resulting from this 3D mapping have been interpreted using a two-dimensional (2D) flow and transport numerical model of an idealized cross-section of the mixing zone. The result of the model shows a slope of the mixing zone that is similar to that obtained by 3D mapping and lower than in previous models. To explain this geometry, the 2D model was used to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in the mixing zone geometry. The higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is, the lower the slope and the shallower the mixing zone become. This occurs because most of the freshwater lateral recharge flows through the upper aquifer due to its much higher transmissivity, thus reducing the freshwater head. The presence of a few meters of highly permeable materials in the upper part of these hydrogeological systems, such as alluvial fans or karstifled evaporites that are frequently associated with the salt flats, is enough to greatly modify the geometry of the saline interface.

AB  - Ground water is an important source of clean water supply throughout the world. A growing literature on the management of groundwater which takes into account the interaction of groundwater with surface water resupply sources (e.g., streams or lakes) is driven by concerns of intensified global fresh-water use coupled with increasing industrial and agricultural pollution levels. Our joint laboratory and numerical experiments simulate water withdrawals via two pumping wells from an unconfined aquifer bounded by two surface water bodies (streams or lakes). The water table position in the experimental setup was visualized by eight piezometers and numerically computed using VISUAL MODFLOW PRO, for different pumping regimes and initial hydraulic slopes. We also analyze numerically pollutant transport from the aquifer's boundaries toward the pumping wells. We show that it is possible to minimize pollution in the wells downstream of a polluted lake by managing the relative pumping rates in the two wells and the overall water table slope in the aquifer. The goal of our research is to (a) observe the physical processes involved in water and conservative tracer flow in an aquifer system surrounded by two lakes (b) develop a joint laboratory-numerical modeling teaching tool for future research and classroom use and (c) provide a simple tool that can be further developed to assist in management decisions regarding water-flow and pollution levels in aquifers.

AB  - Background: While freshwater sustainability is generally defined as the provisioning of water for both people and the environment, in practice it is largely focused only on supplying water to furnish human population growth. Symptomatic of this is the state of Arizona, where rapid growth outside of the metropolitan Phoenix-Tucson corridor relies on the same groundwater that supplies year-round flow in rivers. Using Arizona as a case study, we present the first study in the southwestern United States that evaluates the potential impact of future population growth and water demand on streamflow depletion across multiple watersheds. Methodology/Principal Findings: We modeled population growth and water demand through 2050 and used four scenarios to explore the potential effects of alternative growth and water management strategies on river flows. Under the base population projection, we found that rivers in seven of the 18 study watersheds could be dewatered due to municipal demand. Implementing alternative growth and water management strategies, however, could prevent four of these rivers from being dewatered. Conclusions/Significance: The window of opportunity to implement water management strategies is narrowing. Because impacts from groundwater extraction are cumulative and cannot be immediately reversed, proactive water management strategies should be implemented where groundwater will be used to support new municipal demand. Our approach provides a low-cost method to identify where alternative water and growth management strategies may have the most impact, and demonstrates that such strategies can maintain a continued water supply for both people and the environment.

AB  - In countries like Spain, where water is a limited resource, reusing effluents from wastewater treatment plants may imply the introduction of incompletely eliminated pollutants into the environment. Therefore, this work identified the role of sorption and biodegradation in attenuating pharmaceutical compounds (acetaminophen, carbamazepine, caffeine, naproxen and sulfamethoxazole) in natural soil. It also determined which sorption and removal ("sorption + biodegradation") kinetics models describe the behaviour of these substances in the water-soil system. Presence of potential transformation products (TPs) as a result of pharmaceuticals biodegradation was also studied. To this end, serial batch-type experiments were performed with a soil: water ratio of 1:4 and an initial pharmaceutical concentration of 100 mu g L-1. Despite results are dependent on soil characteristics, they revealed that, for those substances with a higher affinity to the soil used (loamy sand), sorption seems to play a key role during the first 48 h of contactwith soil, and gives way to biodegradation afterwards. The sorption of the pharmaceuticals studied follows a pseudo second-order kinetics. Caffeine and sulfamethoxazole displayed the fastest initial sorption velocities (h = 2055 and h = 228 mu g kg(-1) h(-1), respectively). The removal kinetics experiments, satisfactorily simulated by the first-order kinetics model, indicated the presence of potential microbial adaptation to degradation. Indeed, half-lives decreased from 1.6- to 11.7-fold with respect to initial values. The microbial capacity to degrade sulfamethoxazole could be a matter of concern if bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic. Caffeine, acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole were mitigated to a greater extent, whereas the removal of naproxen and carbamazepine was more limited. The appearance of epoxy-carbamazepine and N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole as possible TPs of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, respectively, indicated that biodegradation was incomplete and showed the capacity of soil microbes to transform these substances.

AB  - Aquifers provide a reliable freshwater source in arid and semiarid regions, where droughts are common and irrigated crops present significant water requirements, so intensive pumping is generally needed. Over-extraction leads to dropping water tables, which in turn threatens the survival of groundwater-dependent ecosystems and water supplies. This calls for strategies to channel hydrological, environmental, agricultural, political and social change. Based on the experience of the Mancha Occidental aquifer, Spain, this paper explores some of the complexities of managing groundwater, dealing with the long-term changes that intensive groundwater use has generated in the region. The Mancha experience shows how environmental conservation may drive social and economic change at the regional scale for periods spanning several decades. What makes this case study unique, however, is the combination of social and environmental conflicts, most of which stem from the prevalence of illegal water use, and their detrimental effect on Ramsar wetlands. The situation exposed a paradox, namely that subsidies for farmers to cut down on water use were actually detrimental to the welfare of groundwater-dependent ecosystems. The unexpected (and timely) occurrence of extreme rainfall events in recent times, after 40 years of ineffective management measures and sustained environmental degradation, enabled the aquifer and its associated wetlands to recover spectacularly to a near-pristine condition. As groundwater-dependent wetlands are highly sensitive ecosystems, it is concluded that it is up to society to decide how much environmental damage can be tolerated in exchange for the social and economic benefits of groundwater-based development.

AB  - Conflicts between intensive groundwater use and wetland conservation are widespread throughout and and semiarid regions worldwide. These have become more significant wherever there has been a synchronism between pumping-based human development and the awakening of an environmental awareness in society. The Mancha Occidental aquifer provides an example of such an occurrence, which has given rise to noteworthy social conflicts. This paper presents a cross-policy analysis for wetland restoration measures, establishing the main reasons why funding-intensive agricultural, environmental, and water policies have only attained marginal success in recovering the area's aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Artesian springs are localized aquifer outlets that originate when pressurized ground water is allowed to rise to the surface. Computing artesian discharge directly is often subject to practical difficulties such as restricted accessibility, abundant vegetation or slow flow rates. These circumstances call for indirect approaches to quantify flow. This paper presents a method to estimate ground water discharge through an upwelling spring by means of a three-layer steady-state groundwater flow model. Model inputs include on-site measurements of vertical sediment permeability, sediment temperatures and hydraulic gradients. About 70 spring bed piezometers were used to carry out permeability tests within the spring sediments, as well as to quantify the hydraulic head at different depths below the discharge point. Sediment temperatures were measured at different depths and correlated to permeabilities in order to demonstrate the potential of temperature as a substitute for cumbersome slug tests. Results show that the spatial distribution of discharge through the spring bottom is highly heterogeneous, as sediment permeability varies by several orders of magnitude within centimetres. Sensitivity analyses imply that geostatistical interpolation is irrelevant to the results if field datasets come from a sufficiently high resolution of piezometric records.

AB  - Participatory methods provide an increasingly accepted path to integrated assessment. This paper reflects on the role of two participatory modelling initiatives implemented in a highly conflictive setting: the Mancha Occidental aquifer, Spain. The methodologies are described within the context of the case study, examining their potential relevance to integrated assessment from a conceptual standpoint. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are analysed in absolute and relative terms, attending to the different stages of the modelling process. The focus then shifts to explore the implications of this work within the context of participatory integrated assessment and scenario analysis. This serves the purpose of establishing the reasons why the tools have been useful in the eyes of stakeholders, and how the case-specific findings of this project may be relevant to other settings.

AB  - A methodological procedure is proposed for determining the renewal period (RP), which expresses the ratio of total storage to recharge of carbonate aquifers, and it was applied to the overexploited moderate-size Becerrero carbonate aquifer (southern Spain). To this end, geological and subsurface data-time domain electromagnetic (TEM) soundings and borehole logs-were integrated to construct a three-dimensional (3D) geological model of the aquifer. The interconnected porosity was estimated by analyzing 73 rock samples. The resulting 3D geometrical model makes it possible to quantify the fractions of the aquifer having a confined or unconfined behaviour. Based on the total storage capacity (179 center dot 10(6)-514 center dot 10(6) m(3)) and available aquifer recharge estimation (4.8 center dot 10(6)-6.4 center dot 10(6) m(3)/year), an RP between 37 and 106 years is obtained. In view of the RP, an exploitation rate slightly lower than the average recharge of the system is recommended, so that the piezometric level will be stable but below the discharge head that is produced through the springs in natural conditions. The proposed methodology to obtain an aquifer RP and the management strategies designed accordingly are of broad interest, especially for carbonate aquifers, which are abundant in arid and semiarid regions.

AB  - The carbonate aquifers of Sierra de Estepa, situated in southern Spain, are undergoing intensive groundwater exploitation. Consequently, the volume of pumping surpasses the average recharge for periods of several consecutive years. Under such conditions, nearby springs have either dried up or only function during short time periods, after very rainy episodes followed by long droughts. During the brief periods when the springs are active, their water and the water extracted by pumping are calcium bicarbonates, with a spatial temporal variability of their physico-chemical characteristics that is mainly conditioned by the degree of functional karstiflcation of each system. When the springs are inactive, the pumping water gradually increases in salinity and becomes HCO3ClCaNa, CIHCO3NaCa and CINa. Under the new conditions caused by so much pumping, the main factors determining the hydrochemical changes are the mixing of waters and the subsequent reactions of dissolution precipitation between (I) the recharge coming from rainwater, (2) the hypersaline inputs from the clay-evaporite aquitards situated on the edges and at the base of the aquifer, and (3) the water stored in each aquifer. The hydrochemical information acquired allowed us to characterize and model the groundwater of these aquifers, to study the causes of its great spatial and temporal variability, and explain the influence of exploitation. This research shows that making sustainable use of water resources associated with carbonate aquifers calls for sound knowledge of the relationship between the aquifer and other bodies of groundwater or surface water, the hydrochemical quality of these possible inputs, and the vulnerability of the aquifer to exploitation, which in turn is conditioned by the ratio between water reserves and recharge.

AB  - Quantifying groundwater recharge in carbonate aquifers located in semi-arid regions and subjected to intensive groundwater use is no easy task. One reason is that there are very few available methods suitable for application under such climatic conditions, and moreover, some of the methods that might be applied were originally designed with reference to non-carbonate aquifers. In addition, it is necessary to take into account the fact that, in any given aquifer, groundwater recharge is modified by the groundwater exploitation. Here we focus on four methods selected to assess their suitability for estimating groundwater recharge in carbonate aquifers affected by intensive exploitation. The methods were applied to the Estepa Range aquifers of Seville, southern Spain, which are subjected to different degrees of exploitation. Two conventional methods were used: chloride mass balance and daily soil-water balance. These results were compared with the results obtained by means of two non-conventional methods, designed for application to the carbonate aquifers of southern Spain: the APLIS and ERAS methods. The results of the different methods are analogous, comparable to those obtained in nearby non-exploited carbonate aquifers, confirming their suitability for use with carbonate aquifers in either natural or exploited regimes in a semi-arid climate.

AB  - Climate change will affect the dynamics of the hydrogeological systems and their water resources quality; in particular nitrate, which is herein taken as a paradigmatic pollutant to illustrate the effects of climate change on groundwater quality. Based on climatic predictions of temperature and precipitation for the horizon of 2021 and 2050, as well as on land use distribution, water balances are recalculated for the hydrological basins of distinct aquifer systems in a western Mediterranean region as Catalonia (NE Spain) in order to determine the reduction of available water resources. Besides the fact that climate change will represent a decrease of water availability, we qualitatively discuss the modifications that will result from the future climatic scenarios and their impact on nitrate pollution according to the geological setting of the selected aquifers. Climate effects in groundwater quality are described according to hydrological, environmental, socio-economic, and political concerns. Water reduction stands as a major issue that will control stream-aquifer interactions and subsurface recharge, leading to a general modification of nitrate in groundwater as dilution varies. A nitrate mass balance model provides a gross estimation of potential nitrate evolution in these aquifers, and it points out that the control of the fertilizer load will be crucial to achieve adequate nitrate content in groundwater. Reclaimed wastewater stands as local reliable resource, yet its amount will only satisfy a fraction of the loss of available resources due to climate change. Finally, an integrated management perspective is necessary to avoid unplanned actions from private initiatives that will jeopardize the achievement of sustainable water resources exploitation under distinct hydrological scenarios.

AB  - Evaluating the likelihood of a flash flood as well as flood water resource is vital for establishing properly sustainable developments in arid environments. However, the high degree of spatial and temporal variability in hydrometeorological processes and the general lack of suitable data limit these efforts. In the present work, a runoff model, adopting the simple Soil Conservation Service method, was built for 13 ungauged catchments in Southern Sinai, Egypt. Runoff modeling was conducted as a function of the descriptive parameters of the catchments, and the maximum average rainfall occurred in 1 day in the period 1960-1990, designed according to a storm event recorded at the outlet of one of the studied catchments on the 2nd of November 1994. The catchments' descriptive parameters were extracted from available remote sensing data and field investigations. Land covers including road networks and 83 rock-soil types were also extracted from the maximum likelihood classification of the Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery. The catchments were then subdivided into 103 smaller subcatchments, which were then placed into different terrain types according to hydrologically relevant surface characteristics. Hydrologic characteristics and soil type(s) in the subcatchments were estimated during on-site visits. Morphometric parameters of the wadi catchments and the channel networks were derived from the analysis of the SRTM3 digital elevation model (DEM). Hydrographs were drawn and routed to the main catchment outlets based on appropriate wadi dimensions and roughness using the Muskingum's method. The runoff and infiltration volumes were quantified. The resulting models have been used to investigate the relative potential for flooding and the groundwater recharge in the catchments. Further, in order to determine specific sites with a high potential for flood risk and groundwater recharge, decision-ruled integrated analysis of the generated GIS layers describing relative stream power and wetness indices were applied. Due to the lack of flow data, the results of the hydrological models were validated against the DEM-derived relative stream power and the wetness indices as well as against field checks and available reports as an alternative. The results of this study could help to prioritize areas where flood control measures should be directed, as well as effectively augment management plans for the appropriate development of water resources.

AB  - Eighteen groundwater well sites located in Kafr Al-Zayat (Egypt) were sampled monthly from January 2009 to November 2011 for microbial content, Mn+2, Fe+2, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, NO3-, and turbidity. The data were analyzed combining the integrated use of factor and cluster analyses as well as the geostatistical semi-variogram modeling. The prime objectives were to assess the groundwater suitability for drinking, to document the factors governing the spatio-tempral variability, and to recognize distinctive groundwater quality patterns to help enable effective sustainability and proactive management of the limited resource. The groundwater microbial, Mn+2, Fe+2, TDS, and total hardness contents violated the drinking water local standards while the turbidity and the nitrate content complied with them. Factor analysis indicated that the microbial content is the most influential factor raising the variability potential followed, in decreasing order, by Mn2+, Fe2+, TDS, NO3-, turbidity, and finally the total hardness. Turbidity resulting from urban and agricultural runoff was strongly associated with most of the quality parameters. Quality parameters fluctuate sporadically without concrete pattern in space and time while their variability scores peak in November every year. Three spatially distinctive quality patterns were recognized that were consistent with and affected by the cumulative effects of the local topography, depth to water table, thickness of the silty clay (cap layer), surface water, and groundwater flow direction and hence the recharge from contaminated surface canals and agricultural drains.

AB  - Extensive urban, agricultural and industrial expansions on the western fringe of the Nile Delta of Egypt have exerted much load on the water needs and lead to groundwater quality deterioration. Documenting the spatial variation of the groundwater quality and their controlling factors is vital to ensure sustainable water management and safe use. A comprehensive dataset of 451 shallow groundwater samples were collected in 2011 and 2012. On-site field measurements of the total dissolved solids (TDS), electric conductivity (EC), pH, temperature, as well as lab-based ionic composition of the major and trace components were performed. Groundwater types were derived and the suitability for irrigation use was evaluated. Multivariate statistical techniques of factor analysis and K-means clustering were integrated with the geostatistical semi-variogram modeling for evaluating the spatial hydrochemical variations and the driving factors as well as for hydrochemical pattern recognition. Most hydrochemical parameters showed very wide ranges; TDS (201-24,400 mg/l), pH (6.72-8.65), Na+ (28.30-7774 mg/l), and Cl- (7-12,186 mg/l) suggesting complex hydrochemical processes of multiple sources. TDS violated the limit (1200 mg/l) of the Egyptian standards for drinking water quality in many localities. Extreme concentrations of Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, are mostly related to their natural content in the water-bearing sediments and/or to contamination from industrial leakage. Very high nitrate concentrations exceeding the permissible limit (50 mg/l) were potentially maximized toward hydrologic discharge zones and related to wastewater leakage. Three main water types; NaCl (29%), Na2SO4 (26%), and NaHCO3 (20%), formed 75% of the groundwater dominated in the saline depressions, sloping sides of the coastal ridges of the depressions, and in the cultivated/newly reclaimed lands intensely covered by irrigation canals, respectively. Water suitability for irrigation use clarified that the majority of the groundwater samples (83%) had very high to high salinity hazards. These are unsuitable for irrigation of regular crops and hence special management practices with salt resistant plants were recommended. Four factors, arranged respectively in decreasing order of influence, governed the spatial variability of the aquifers; salinity enhancement, nutrient contamination, multiple mechanisms of freshwater percolation and phosphate fertilizers, and the dissolution of the calcium and phosphate contents. Three distinctive regional hydrochemical clusters were recognized influenced by the proximity to the seawater, evaporite dominance in the soils/water-bearing formations, recharge from surface canals, and over-pumping in the intensely populated/newly reclaimed areas. Results could help prioritize areas for future sustainable groundwater development plans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two hundred forty-nine groundwater samples collected from 55 irrigation water supply wells in Al-Mahala Al-Kubra, Samannoud, and Al-Santa districts of the Gharbiya Governorate (Egypt) during a monitoring survey carried out in January, June, and in November in 3 years (2013-2015). The prime objective was to document, for the first time, the status and sustained trends in the concentrations of pesticides in the shallow Nile Delta aquifer. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Thiel-Sen trend statistical tests were applied for detection and estimation of trends and their magnitude. Violation of standards clarified emergence of methyl parathion (98.1%), endrin (97.9%), endosulfan sulfate (96.5%), dieldrin (55.3%), atrazine (42.3%), and simazine (40.4%), in decreasing order of abundances. Malathion obeyed the permissible limits (900 mu g L-1) in all samples. Methyl parathion showed an average rate of deterioration (mu g L-1 year(-1)) of 0.82 that was largest in Al-Santa (1.0) followed by Al-Mahala Al-Kubra (0.63). Malathion proved the second largest rate emerging in Al-Mahala Al-Kubra (0.67) followed by Al-Santa (0.65). Endosulfan sulfate came third in deterioration rate (av. 0.37) followed by endrin (av. 0.32), atrazine (av. 0.32), dieldrin (av. 0.25), and simazine (av. 0.23). Groundwater improvements of pesticide contents propagated faster eastward and northward associated with larger surface water recharge rates from dense complex irrigation canals through thicker topmost silty clay layer and thicker peat layers inter-bedded in the sediments. For sustainable agriculture to alleviate negative impacts on groundwater resources and the environment, the use of ecofriendly bio-degradable or quickly deactivated pesticides along with awareness of farmers with the health hazards and the protective measures while handling pesticides are strongly recommended.

Due to the absence of natural surface irrigation supplies, the only source of water in the area is the Pliocene groundwater aquifer. As a result, secondary salinization from increased abstractions is the major threat to the groundwater aquifer. There is a dire need for efficient strategies to ensure long-term sustainability of the area's productive agriculture. These strategies should be based on scientific spatio-temporal monitoring and analysis of the groundwater conditions that is also lacking. To capture the spatio-temporal variability in groundwater conditions, field measurements of total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, and water level as well as lab-based ionic composition were performed on 47 groundwater samples collected during 2006 and 2007. Determinations of the hydrochemical characteristics, water types, salt assemblages, and the sodium adsorption ratio were carried out on the samples. Reference data sets recorded in 1973 and 1997 were available for the area and were used to monitor the changes occurred in these periods. Geographic information system (GIS) was appraised for mapping and for integrated analysis of the different layers. Remotely sensed change detection techniques were applied to the Landsat TM and the ETM + imageries and used to highlight the extensive reclamation and urbanization and to find key trends for the alterations in the groundwater conditions and their spatial association with land covers. Results revealed a topographic depression-induced flow pattern, predominance of leaching and dissolution processes, the presence of saline lakes, over-pumping from the Pliocene aquifer, and temporal changes in land uses are the main factors combined to control the spatio-temporal variability in the groundwater. Results also clarified the presence of two: northwestern and southeastern zones that varied distinctively in their hydrodynamic and hydrochemical characteristics. The northwestern zone showed an average water level decline of 15 m, the water of which is brackish (av. 2,037 mg/l) with dominant Na(+), Cl(-) and SO(4) (2-) ions. The groundwater of this zone is characterized by high to very high salinity hazard and high to very high alkali hazard and is not recommended for irrigation on soils with poor drainage and without proper management for salinity control. The southeastern zone showed water level decline less than 2 m, the water of which is fresh (av. 424 mg/l) with major Na(+), HCO(3) (-), Cl(-), and SO(4) (2-) ions, and quality suitable for irrigation with medium to high salinity and low to medium alkali hazards. The article represents the first step towards an integrated management of Wadi El-Natrun groundwater resources within a GIS framework.

AB  - The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer (NSSA) is the main groundwater resource of the El-Bahariya Oasis, which is located in the middle of the Western Desert of Egypt. This aquifer is composed mainly of continental clastic sediments of sandstone with shale and clay intercalations of saturated thickness ranging between 100 and 1500 m. Vulnerability assessment to delineate areas that are more susceptible to contamination from anthropogenic sources has become an important element for sustainable resources management and land use planning. Accordingly, this research aims to estimate the vulnerability of NSSA by applying the DRASTIC model as well as utilising sensitivity analyses to evaluate the relative importance of the model parameters for aquifer vulnerability in the study area. The main objective is to demonstrate the combined use of the DRASTIC and the GIS techniques as an effective method for groundwater pollution risk assessment, and mapping the areas that are prone to deterioration of groundwater quality and quantity. Based on DRASTIC index (DI) values, a groundwater vulnerability map was produced using the GIS. The aquifer analysis in the study area highlighted the following key points: the northeastern and western parts of the NSSA were dominated by 'High' vulnerability classes while the northwestern and southeastern parts were characterised by 'Medium' vulnerability classes. The elevated central part of the study area displayed 'Low' aquifer vulnerability. The vulnerability map shows a relatively greater risk imposed on the northeastern part of the NSSA due to the larger pollution potential of intensive vegetable cultivation. Depth-to-water, topography and hydraulic conductivity parameters were found to be more effective in assessing aquifer vulnerability.

AB  - Groundwater resources in semi-arid areas and especially in the Mediterranean face a growing demand for irrigated agriculture and, to a lesser extent, for domestic uses. Consequently, groundwater reserves are affected and water-table drops are widely observed. This leads to strong constraints on groundwater access for farmers, while managers worry about the future evolution of the water resources. A common problem for building proper groundwater management plans is the difficulty in assessing individual groundwater withdrawals at regional scale. Predicting future trends of these groundwater withdrawals is even more challenging. The basic question is how to assess the water budget variables and their evolution when they are deeply linked to human activities, themselves driven by countless factors (access to natural resources, public policies, market, etc.). This study provides some possible answers by focusing on the assessment of groundwater withdrawals for irrigated agriculture at three sites in North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria). Efforts were made to understand the different features that influence irrigation practices, and an adaptive user-oriented methodology was used to monitor groundwater withdrawals. For each site, different key factors affecting the regional groundwater abstraction and its past evolution were identified by involving farmers' knowledge. Factors such as farmer access to land and groundwater or development of public infrastructures (electrical distribution network) are crucial to decode the results of well inventories and assess the regional groundwater abstraction and its future trend. This leads one to look with caution at the number of wells cited in the literature, which could be oversimplified.

AB  - Since the 1990s, Indian farmers, supported by the government, have partially shifted from surface-water to groundwater irrigation in response to the uncertainty in surface-water availability. Water-management authorities only slowly began to consider sustainable use of groundwater resources as a prime concern. Now, a reliable integration of groundwater resources for water-allocation planning is needed to prevent aquifer overexploitation. Within the 11,000-km(2) Musi River sub-basin (South India), human interventions have dramatically impacted the hard-rock aquifers, with a water-table drop of 0.18 m/a over the period 1989-2004. A fully distributed numerical groundwater model was successfully implemented at catchment scale. The model allowed two distinct conceptualizations of groundwater availability to be quantified: one that was linked to easily quantified fluxes, and one that was more expressive of long-term sustainability by taking account of all sources and sinks. Simulations showed that the latter implied 13 % less available groundwater for exploitation than did the former. In turn, this has major implications for the existing water-allocation modelling framework used to guide decision makers and water-resources managers worldwide.

AB  - In many parts of the world, groundwater users regularly face serious resource-depletion threat. At the same time, "groundwater overexploitation" is massively cited when discussing groundwater management problems. A kind of standard definition tends to relegate groundwater overexploitation only as a matter of inputs and outputs. However, a thorough state-of-the-art analysis shows that groundwater overexploitation is not only a matter of hydrogeology but also a qualification of exploitation based on political, social, technical, economic or environmental criteria. Thus, an aquifer with no threat to groundwater storage can rightly be considered as overexploited because of many other prejudicial aspects. So, why is groundwater overexploitation so frequently only associated with resource-depletion threat and so rarely related to other prejudicial aspects? In that case, what really lies behind the use of the overexploitation concept? The case of the Kairouan plain aquifer in central Tunisia was used to analyze the way that the overexploitation message emerges in a given context, how groundwater-use stakeholders (farmers, management agencies and scientists) each qualify the problem in their own way, and how they see themselves with regard to the concept of overexploitation. The analysis shows that focusing messages on overexploitation conceals the problems encountered by the various stakeholders: difficulties accessing water, problems for the authorities in controlling the territory and individual practices, and complications for scientists when qualifying hydrological situations. The solutions put forward to manage overexploitation are at odds with the problems that arise locally, triggering tensions and leading to misunderstandings between the parties involved.

AB  - This work integrates detailed geological and hydrogeological information with PSI data to obtain a better understanding of subsidence processes detected in the detrital aquifer of the Vega de Granada (SE Spain) during the past 13 years. Ground motion was monitored by exploiting SAR images from the ENVISAT (2003-2009), Cosmo-SkyMed (2011-2014) and Sentinel-1A (2015-2016) satellites. PSInSAR results show an inelastic deformation in the aquifer and small land surface displacements (up to -55 mm). The most widespread land subsidence is detected during the ENVISAT period (2003-2009), which coincided with a long, dry period in the region. The highest displacement rates recorded during this period (up to 10 mm/yr) were detected in the central part of the aquifer, where many villages are located. For this period, there is a good correlation between groundwater level depletion and the augmentation, of the average subsidence velocity and slight hydraulic head changes (<2 m) have a rapid ground motion response. The Cosmo-SkyMed period (2011-2014) coincided with a rainy period, and the land subsidence is only concentrated in some points. Rates of average subsidence up to 11.5 mm/yr are obtained for this period and are anthropogenic in origin, being related to earthmoving works. During the Sentinel-1A monitoring period (2015-2016) most of the region showed no deformation, except for some points of unknown origin in the NE sector. A general conclusion is that there is a clear lithological control in the spatial distribution of ground subsidence; all the subsiding areas detected are located where a higher clay content was identified. Although the SE sector of the aquifer had more intense groundwater exploitation, no land subsidence processes were detected, as coarse-grained sediments predominate in the substratum. This research will contribute to the drawing-up of a management plan for the sustainable use of this strategic aquifer, taking into account critical levels of groundwater depletion to avoid land subsidence in the areas identified as vulnerable. The European Space Agency satellite Sentinel-1A could be an effective decision making tool in the near future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditionally the Cooper-Jacob equation is used to determine the transmissivity and the storage coefficient for an aquifer using pump test results. This model, however, is a simplified version of the actual subsurface and does not allow for analysis of the uncertainty that comes from a lack of knowledge about the heterogeneity of the environment under investigation. In this paper, a modified fuzzy least-squares regression (MFLSR) method is developed that uses imprecise pump test data to obtain fuzzy intercept and slope values which are then used in the Cooper-Jacob method. Fuzzy membership functions for the transmissivity and the storage coefficient are then calculated using the extension principle. The supports of the fuzzy membership functions incorporate the transmissivity and storage coefficient values that would be obtained using ordinary least-squares regression and the Cooper-Jacob method. The MFLSR coupled with the Cooper-Jacob method allows the analyst to ascertain the uncertainty that is inherent in the estimated parameters obtained using the simplified Cooper-Jacob method and data that are uncertain due to lack of knowledge regarding the heterogeneity of the aquifer.

AB  - River deltas sustain important ecosystems with rich biodiversity and large biomass, as well as human populations via the availability of water and food sources. Anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, tourism and agriculture, may pose threats to river deltas. The knowledge of the factors controlling the regional water quality regime in these areas is important for planning sustainable use and management of the water resources. Here, hydrochemical methods and multivariate statistical techniques were combined to investigate the shallow aquifer of the Pinios River (Thessaly) deltaic plain with respect to water quality, hydrogeochemical evolution and interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies. Water quality assessment indicated that most of the river and groundwater samples fully comply with the criteria set by the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC). The river is recharged mainly from springs of the Tempi valley and the shallow aquifer, and to a lesser degree from precipitation, throughout the year. The hydrogeochemical characteristics indicated a cation (Ca, Mg, and Na) bicarbonate water type, which evolves to calcium -chloride, sodium-bicarbonate and sodium-chloride water type, in the northern part of the delta. Calcite and dolomite dissolution determined the major ion chemistry, but other processes, such as silicate weathering and cation exchange reactions, also contributed. In the northern part of the plain, the interaction with the deeper aquifer enriched the shallow aquifer with Na and Cl ions. Principal Component Analysis showed that five components (PCs) explain 77% of the total variance of water quality parameters; these are: (1) salinity; (2) water-silicate rocks interaction; (3) hardness due to calcite dissolution, and cation exchange processes; (4) nitrogen pollution; and (5) non-N-related artificial fertilizers. This study demonstrated that the variation of water hydrochemistry in the deltaic plain could be attributed to natural and anthropogenic processes. The interpretation of the PCA results dictated the parameters used for the development of a modified Water Quality Index (WQI), to provide a more comprehensive spatial representation of the water quality of the river delta.

AB  - As the Ogallala Aquifer depletes there is a need to identify management options that might make un-irrigated cotton production sustainable over the U.S. Southern High Plains (SHP). To explore those options, the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model was used to simulate the effects of planting options and elevation effects on SHP dryland cotton production. Of the management variables that define the 56 planting options simulated, planting date and density account for the most variability in median SHP yields. Cooler SHP growing seasons have the effect of reducing median lint yields relative to those simulated over the lower elevations of the nearby Rolling Plains. This effect is not as evident in median Rolling Plains yields, which suggests it can be traced to the cooler growing environment of the higher SHP elevations. Also, at both higher and lower elevations lower planting densities maximize median yields, while higher densities result in the lowest yields. These results suggest that the yield suppressing effect of the SHP region's cooler growing conditions might be compensated for by planting early whenever possible and planting at lower densities. The clear decreasing effect on median yields at higher elevation also suggests the possibility of SHP cotton production moving to the lower elevations of the nearby Rolling Plains as Ogallala Aquifer levels drop.

AB  - Irrigated cotton (Gossypium Hirsutum L.) production is a central part of west Texas agriculture that depends on the essentially non-renewable water resource of the Ogallala aquifer. Web-based decision support tools that estimate the profit effects of irrigation for cotton under varying lint price, production cost, and well capacity conditions could help to optimize the agricultural value of the Ogallala's water. The crop modeling and profit analysis component of such a support tool is demonstrated here. This web application is based on a database of modeled yields generated from the meteorological records of four weather stations under un-irrigated (dryland) conditions and under center pivot irrigation with 12 total irrigation (TI) levels spanning deficit to full irrigation conditions. The application converts the database's dryland and irrigated yield outcomes into corresponding values of profit per hectare based on user-defined yield values and production costs. Given the resulting values of dryland and irrigated profit per unit area and the additional constraints of a user's well capacity and center pivot area, the application also calculates the profit effects of dividing center pivot area into dryland and irrigated production under the 12 irrigation levels.

AB  - Different aspects of management policies for shallow geothermal systems are currently under development. Although this technology has been used for a long time, doubts and concerns have been raised in the last years due to the massive implementation of new systems. To assess possible environmental impacts and manage subsurface energy resources, collecting data from operating shallow geothermal systems is becoming mandatory in Europe. This study presents novel advances in the upscaling of operation datasets obtained from open-loop geothermal energy systems for an optimal integration in hydrogeological models. The proposed procedure allows efficient numerical simulations to be performed at an urban scale. Specifically, this work proposes a novel methodology to optimize the data treatment of highly transient real exploitation regimes by integrating energy transfer in the environment to reduce more than 90% registered raw datasets. The proposed methodology is then applied to and validated on five different real optimization scenarios in which upscaling transformation of the injection temperature series of 15-min sampling frequency has been considered. The error derived from each approach was evaluated and compared for validation purposes. The results obtained from the upscaling procedures have proven the usefulness and transferability of the proposed method for achieving daily time functions to efficiently reproduce the exploitation regimes of these systems with an acceptable error in a sustainable resource management framework.

AB  - In this study, several hydrogeological catchments of Central Italy have been characterized focusing the attention on the presence of areas in which, over the last two decades, the hydrological equilibrium between recharge and discharge (phenomena of marked reduction of spring discharge and progressive drawdown of groundwater levels) has been compromised by overexploitation of groundwater resources. A GIS system has been used in order to develop the study and the homogenous distribution of the hydrological knowledge and of the existing imbalances has been performed. Characterizing elements of the research are: a) the definition of the hydrogeological units; b) the hydrogeological survey of around a thousand water-points; c) the monthly analysis of climatic data of numerous survey stations; d) the census and the recording of water concessions; e) the evaluation of agriculture hydro-exigency derived from the analysis of the use of soil; f) the withdrawals defined by a statistic analysis of data. These elements have allowed to define the Distributed Hydrogeological Budget which is a useful instrument to evaluate critical areas.

AB  - Dambos, seasonally saturated wetlands, are widespread in headwater catchments in sub-Saharan Africa. It is widely believed that they play an important role in regional hydrology but, despite research conducted over the last 25 years, their hydrological functions remain poorly understood. To improve conceptualisation of hydrological flow paths and investigate the water balance of a small Zimbabwean catchment containing a single dambo, measurements of alkalinity and chloride in different water types within the catchment have been used as chemical markers. The temporal variation in alkalinity is consistent with the premise that all stream water, including the prolonged dry season recession, is derived predominantly from shallow sources. The proposition that dry season recession flows are maintained by water travelling at depth within the underlying saprolite is not substantiated. There is evidence that a low permeability clay lens, commonly present in many dambos, acts as a barrier for vertical water exchange. However, the highly heterogeneous chemical composition of different waters precludes quantitative hydrograph splitting using end member mixing analysis. Calculation of the chloride mass-balance confirms that, after rainfall, evaporation is the largest component of the catchment water budget. The study provides improved understanding of the hydrological functioning of dambos. Such understanding is essential for the development and implementation of sustainable management strategies for this landform.

AB  - The natural geochemical tracer Rn-222 was used to quantify submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) onto the continental shelf of Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Water column samples were collected aboard the R/V Cape Hatteras on July 21-26, 2002, and an additional nearshore water column transect and groundwater samples were collected in 2005/2006. Assessment of SGD was accomplished using a mass balance approach that quantified sources and sinks of radon, including benthic flux, exchange across the pycnocline or air-sea interfaces, horizontal transport into and out of the study area, and a water column inventory. Four independent geochemical box models were developed to quantify SGD regionally and with distance from shore. Overall, water column inventories and diffusion rates decreased with distance from shore. Average water column inventories were 8520 +/- 1310, 7230 +/- 1190, and 760 +/- 510 dpm m(-2) for three shore-parallel boxes from nearshore to offshore, and resulted in a regional average of 5800 +/- 1050 dpm m(-2) for the Regional box model. Diffusion rates of radon through the sediment-water interface were 0.9 +/- 0.2, 0.6 +/- 0.1, and 0.4 +/- 0.1 dpm m(-2) min(-1) for the near to offshore models, and averaged 0.6 +/- 0.1 dpm m(-2) min(-1) for the Regional. box model. SGD estimates were calculated using two end-member Rn-222 activities for the advecting fluids which allowed a distinction between terrestrialty-driven SGD and total SGD. Terrestrially-driven and total SGD estimates averaged 0.2 and 0.7 cm d(-1), respectively. The calculated terrestrially-driven SGD is as important in the delivery of fresh water as riverine sources to Onslow Bay and a significant contributor to the South Atlantic Bight.

AB  - Globally, urban growth will add 1.5 billion people to cities by 2030, making the difficult task of urban water provisions even more challenging. In this article, we develop a conceptual framework of urban water provision as composed of three axes: water availability, water quality, and water delivery. For each axis, we calculate quantitative proxy measures for all cities with more than 50,000 residents, and then briefly discuss the strategies cities are using in response if they are deficient on one of the axes. We show that 523 million people are in cities where water availability may be an issue, 890 million people are in cities where water quality may be an issue, and 1.3 billion people are in cities where water delivery may be an issue. Tapping into groundwater is a widespread response, regardless of the management challenge, with many cities unsustainably using this resource. The strategies used by cities deficient on the water delivery axis are different than for cities deficient on the water quantity or water quality axis, as lack of financial resources pushes cities toward a different and potentially less effective set of strategies.

AB  - The practical implementation of the European Water Framework Directive has resulted in an increased focus on the hyporheic zone. In this paper, an integrated model was developed for evaluating the impact of point sources in groundwater on human health and surface water ecosystems. This was accomplished by coupling the system dynamics-based decision support system CARD-PLUS to the aquatic ecosystem model AQUA TOX using an analytical volatilization model for the stream. The model was applied to a case study where a trichloroethylene (TCE)-contaminated groundwater plume is discharging to a stream. The TCE source will not be depleted for many decades: however, measured and predicted TCE concentrations in surface water were found to be below human health risk management targets. Volatilization rapidly attenuates TCE concentrations in surface water. Thus, only a 30-m stream reach fails to meet surface water quality criteria. An ecological risk assessment found that the TCE contamination did not impact the stream ecosystem. Uncertainty assessment revealed hydraulic conductivity to be the most important site-specific parameter. These results indicate that contaminant plumes with mu gL(-1) concentrations of TCE entering surface water systems may not pose a significant risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The release of chemicals such as chlorinated solvents, pesticides and other xenobiotic organic compounds to streams, either from contaminated sites, accidental or direct application/release, is, a significant threat to water resources. In this paper, different methods for evaluating the impacts of chemical stressors on stream ecosystems are evaluated for a stream in Denmark where the effects of major physical habitat degradation can be disregarded. The methods are: (i) the Danish Stream Fauna Index, (ii) Toxic Units (TU), (iii) SPEAR indices, (iv) Hazard Quotient (HQ) index and (v) AQUATOX, an ecological model. The results showed that the hydromorphology, nutrients, biological oxygen demand and contaminants (pesticides and trichloroethylene from a contaminated site) originating from groundwater do not affect the good ecological status in the stream. In contrast, the evaluation by the novel SPEAR(pesticides) index and TU indicated that the site is far from obtaining good ecological status - a direct contradiction to the ecological index currently in use in Denmark today - most likely due to stream sediment-bound pesticides arising from the spring spraying season. In order to generalise the findings of this case study, the HQ index and AQUATOX were extended for additional compounds, not only partly to identify potential compounds of concern, but also to determine thresholds where ecological impacts could be expected to occur. The results demonstrate that some commonly used methods for the assessment of ecological impact are not sufficient for capturing - and ideally separating - the effects of all anthropogenic stressors affecting ecosystems. Predictive modelling techniques can be especially useful in supporting early decisions on prioritising hot spots, serving to identify knowledge gaps and thereby direct future data collection. This case study presents a strong argument for combining bioassessment and modelling techniques to multi-stressor field sites, especially before cost-intensive studies are conducted.

AB  - The projected growth in global food demand until mid-century will challenge our ability to continue recent increases in crop yield and will have a significant impact on natural resources. The water and land requirements of current agriculture are significantly less than global reserves but local shortages are common and have serious impacts on food security. Recent increases in global trade have mitigated some of the effects of spatial and temporal variability. However, trade has a limited impact on low-income populations who remain dependent on subsistence agriculture and local resources. Potential adverse environmental impacts of increased agricultural production include unsustainable depletion of water and soil resources, major changes in the global nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, human health problems related to excessive nutrient and pesticide use, and loss of habitats that contribute to agricultural productivity. Some typical case studies from China illustrate the connections between the need for increased food production and environmental stress. Sustainable options for decreasing food demand and for increasing production include reduction of food losses on both the producer and consumer ends, elimination of unsustainable practices such as prolonged groundwater overdraft, closing of yield gaps with controlled expansions of fertilizer application, increases in crop yield and pest resistance through advances in biotechnology, and moderate expansion of rain fed and irrigated cropland. Calculations based on reasonable assumptions suggest that such measures could meet the food needs of an increasing global population while protecting the environment.

AB  - In announcing its bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing chose a "Green Olympics" theme to indicate that hosting the Olympic Games would serve as a catalyst for environmental improvements and sustainable development. With the Olympics now just a short time away, it is appropriate to examine the city's cleanup progress to date. This article does so, and also quantifies some of the health benefits of these cleanup activities, placing an economic value on the gains. Results for air pollution cleanup indicate an economic gain of nearly 50 billion yuan over a ten-year period, with a potential annual gain of 3.5 billion yuan for reaching air quality standards. Water pollution results suggest a potential annual gain of another 2.6 billion yuan.

AB  - Groundwater is a common-pool resource that is subject to depletion in many places around the world as a result of increased use of irrigation and water-demanding cash crops. Where state capacity to control groundwater use is limited, collective action is important to increase recharge and restrict highly water-consumptive crops. We present results of field experiments in hard rock areas of Andhra Pradesh, India, to examine factors affecting groundwater use. Two nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) ran the games in communities where they were working to improve watershed and water management. Results indicate that, when the links between crop choice and groundwater depletion is made explicit, farmers can act cooperatively to address this problem. Longer NGO involvement in the villages was associated with more cooperative outcomes in the games. Individuals with more education and higher perceived community social capital played more cooperatively, but neither gender nor method of payment had a significantly effect on individual behavior. When participants could repeat the game with communication, similar crop choice patterns were observed. The games provided an entry point for discussion on the understanding of communities of the interconnectedness of groundwater use and crop choice.

AB  - Located in the arid basalt desert of northeastern Jordan, the settlement of Jawa is by far the largest and best-preserved archaeological site in the region. The Early Bronze Age (EBA) settlement phase of Jawa (3500-3000 BCE) is characterized by a highly sophisticated water storage system made of a series of pools, dams, and canals. In addition, recent archaeological and geoarchaeological surveys have uncovered agricultural terrace systems in the nearby vicinity. In this study, four of these runoff terrace systems were investigated by detailed mapping. Additionally, thirteen sediment profiles from inside and outside the terrace systems were recorded and sampled. The examined samples were analyzed for bulk chemistry, texture, phytoliths, diatoms, and dung spherulites to supply information on the environmental and depositional conditions. The terrace systems were dated using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Ancient terrace agriculture was practiced on slopes, small plateaus, and valleys close to Jawa through the use of surface canals, which collected and diverted floodwater from nearby wadis or runoff from adjacent slopes. The terraced fields were usually arranged in cascades and comprised a system of risers, canals, and spillways. The terrace fills investigated yield OSL ages of around 3300 BCE, indicating that the terraces were constructed in the Early Bronze Age. The terrace fill sequences are composed of mixed unstratified fine sediments of local origin, reflecting low-energy fluvial deposition regimes. The phytolith record is dominated by Pooid grasses that include the most common Near Eastern cereals, such as wheat and barley. Increased phytolith concentrations in terrace fill sediments, as compared to samples from non-terrace deposits nearby, suggest increased plant growth and water availability within the terraces. Whether the terrace systems were used for growing food crops only or whether they were additionally used for grazing cannot be ascertained. Overall, quantitative phytolith analyses in arid environments are well suited to investigate temporal and spatial distributions of plant microfossil concentrations and their relation to human activity or paleoenvironmental conditions.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems of the world, playing an important role in coastal defense and wildlife conservation. These ecosystems, however, are usually affected by human activities, which may cause a loss and degradation of their ecological status, a decline of their biodiversity, an alteration of their ecological functioning, and a limitation of their ecosystem services. La Pletera salt marshes (NE Spain) are located in a region mainly dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. Part of these wetlands and lagoons has been affected by an incomplete construction of an urban development and in this moment is the focus of a Life(+) project, whose aim is to restore this protected area. Several studies have analyzed the role of hydrological regime in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton in this area, however, the role of groundwater was never considered as a relevant factor in the lagoon dynamics, and its influence is still unknown. In this study, the hydrogeological dynamics in La Pletera salt marshes has been analyzed, as a basis to set sustainable management guidelines for this area. In order to determine their dependence on groundwater resources, monthly hydrochemical (with major ions and nutrients) and isotopic (delta O-18(H2O) and delta D) campaigns have been conducted, from November 2014 to October 2015. In particular, groundwater from six wells, surface water from two nearby streams and three permanent lagoons, and sea water was considered in these surveys. Taking into account the meteorological data and the water levels in the lagoons, the General Lake Model has been conducted to determine, not only evaporation and rainfall occurring in the lagoons, but also the total inflows and outflows. In addition, the Gonfiantini isotopic model, together with equilibrium chemical-speciation/mass transfer models, has been used to analyze the evaporation and the physicochemical processes affecting the lagoons. Results show that during the dry season groundwater inputs may account for 15-80% of the water in La Pletera lagoons. Besides, water salinity depends on two main processes: 1) mixing of fresh and sea water occurring within the lagoons or in the aquifer; and 2) evaporation. According to the obtained results, the goal of preserving La Pletera lagoons and their salinity conditions implies maintaining groundwater fluxes towards the ocean, and also the hydraulic connectivity of these lagoons with the aquifer.

AB  - The objective of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) is to assist in the development of management plans that will lead to the sustainable use of water resources in all EU member states. However, defining the degree of sustainability aimed at is not a straightforward task. It requires detailed knowledge of the hydrogeological characteristics of the basin in question, its environmental needs, the amount of human water demand, and the opportunity to construct a proper water balance that describes the behavior of the hydrological system and estimates available water resources. An analysis of the water balance in the Selva basin (Girona, NE Spain) points to the importance of regional groundwater fluxes in satisfying current exploitation rates, and shows that regional scale approaches are often necessary to evaluate water availability. In addition, we discuss the pressures on water resources, and analyze potential actions, based on the water balance results, directed towards achieving sustainable water management in the basin.

AB  - Multivariate techniques are useful in hydrogeological studies to reduce the complexity of large-scale data sets, and provide more understandable insight into the system hydrology. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) has been used as an exploratory method to identify the key parameters that define distinct flow systems in the Selva basin (NE Spain). In this statistical analysis, all the information obtained in hydrogeological studies (that is, hydrochemical and isotopic data, but also potentiometric data) is used. Additionally, cluster analysis, based on PCA results, allows the associations between samples to be identified, and thus, corroborates the occurrence of different groundwater fluxes. PCA and cluster analysis reveal that two main groundwater flow systems exist in the Selva basin, each with distinct hydrochemical, isotopic, and potentiometric features. Regional groundwater fluxes are associated with high F- contents, and confined aquifer layers: while local fluxes are linked to nitrate polluted unconfined aquifers with a different recharge rates. In agreement with previous hydrogeological studies, these statistical methods stand as valid screening tools to highlight the fingerprint variables that can be used as indicators to facilitate further, more arduous, analytical approaches and a feasible interpretation of the whole data set.

AB  - On the basis of a case study in northern Costa Rica, in an area of one of the country's most important volcanic aquifers, we developed a GIS-based groundwater management system suitable for the limited financial, technical and data resources of developing countries. Input and processing of attribute data-like information about groundwater wells or geological outcrops are realized with the help of an ACCESS database. The GIS-platform ArcView is used for input and analysis of all types of spatial data, e.g. maps of geology, hydrogeotogy, land use, or locations of groundwater wells. A threedimensional model of the subsurface geology is constructed with the help of the interactive 3D-Modetter RHINOCEROS (R)-NURBS modelling for Windows. The GIS-ptatform ArcView is used for the final integrated spatial analysis of the three-dimensional model and the generated spatial and attribute databases. The basic concept for data analysis is a five-step numerical index as a simple but efficient matter of standardization in order to take into account a wide spectrum of input data of varying quality and precision. As an example of application, the assessment of the vulnerability of aquifers is presented, which can be calculated on the basis of the hydrogeological profile (sequence of different strata with varying permeability), the infiltration potential of the soil layer and the distance to fault zones for each location of the study area.

AB  - Risks associated with the management of groundwater in farming landscapes are at the forefront of public discourse in Australia and North America. There has been very little social research examining rural landholder attitudes to groundwater use and management. This is an important gap given the critical role social acceptability plays in resource access decisions, the important role groundwater plays in sustaining livelihoods, and the vital role it plays in maintaining groundwater dependent ecosystems. This paper attempts to address that gap by exploring how rural landholders interpret risks associated with groundwater use for irrigated agriculture. We do that by using a case study from south eastern Australia where farmers' livelihoods are increasingly dependent on groundwater. We draw upon spatially referenced survey data to investigate the general extent and nature of concern about risk associated with pumping groundwater. We also explore the factors influencing risk interpretation, including occupational identity and proximity to the aquifer. Survey results suggest that while there is concern about pumping groundwater for irrigated agriculture in the Wimmera region, there is also considerable confidence that negative outcomes can be avoided. The dimension of risk of most concern to respondents was the possibility that the benefits of pumping groundwater would not be shared equitably. Those reporting lower concern about the risks of groundwater pumping were more likely to own properties located above the aquifer, to exhibit a strong business orientation including prioritising economic values compared to environmental values, and to express attitudes indicating they thought private property rights should be protected. A substantial proportion of survey respondents indicated they were 'Unsure' on all the risk items in the survey. It seems the future social acceptability of groundwater exploitation in the Wimmera region will depend on the extent that those 'Unsure' shift to the 'Agree' or 'Disagree' cohorts. The survey data suggest that focusing on the economic implications of declining water tables would be an effective way of engaging these rural landholders in dialogue about the sustainability of their groundwater resource.

AB  - Distributed hydrological models are traditionally evaluated against discharge stations, emphasizing the temporal and neglecting the spatial component of a model. The present study widens the traditional paradigm by highlighting spatial patterns of evapotranspiration (ET), a key variable at the land-atmosphere interface, obtained from two different approaches at the national scale of Denmark. The first approach is based on a national water resources model (DKmodel), using the MIKE-SHE model code, and the second approach utilizes a two-source energy balance model (TSEB) driven mainly by satellite remote sensing data. Ideally, the hydrological model simulation and remote-sensing-based approach should present similar spatial patterns and driving mechanisms of ET. However, the spatial comparison showed that the differences are significant and indicate insufficient spatial pattern performance of the hydrological model. The differences in spatial patterns can partly be explained by the fact that the hydrological model is configured to run in six domains that are calibrated independently from each other, as it is often the case for large-scale multi-basin calibrations. Furthermore, the model incorporates predefined temporal dynamics of leaf area index (LAI), root depth (RD) and crop coefficient (Kc) for each land cover type. This zonal approach of model parameterization ignores the spatiotemporal complexity of the natural system. To overcome this limitation, this study features a modified version of the DKmodel in which LAI, RD and Kc are empirically derived using remote sensing data and detailed soil property maps in order to generate a higher degree of spatiotemporal variability and spatial consistency between the six domains. The effects of these changes are analyzed by using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to evaluate spatial patterns. The EOF analysis shows that including remote-sensing-derived LAI, RD and Kc in the distributed hydrological model adds spatial features found in the spatial pattern of remote-sensing-based ET.

AB  - This paper aims to discuss the depositional settings and provenances for the Jurassic in Jiyuan basin, North China, based on the rare earth element (REE) and trace element features of 16 Jurassic argillaceous rock samples from the Anyao, Yangshuzhuang and Ma'ao Formations, respectively. Generally, geochemical analysis results show that chondrite-normalised REE distribution patterns of all the three formations are characterised by light-REE (LREE) enrichment, moderately negative Eu anomalies, slightly negative Ce anomalies, and strong fractionation between LREE and heavy-REE (HREE). Trace element proxies V/(V+Ni), Ceanom index, Ce/La, Sr/Ba, and Sr/Cu indicate a weak oxidation-reduction environment, progressively decreasing reducibility and water depth from the bottom up during Jurassic in Jiyuan basin. Palaeoclimate varied from humid in the Early Jurassic to arid in the Middle Jurassic, corresponding with the variations of palaeoredox and palaeosalinity. The provenances of Jurassic rocks in Jiyuan basin are mainly from felsic sources related to active continental margin and continental island arc. The Early-Middle Jurassic (Anyao and Yangshuzhuang Formations) provenances are mainly derived from North Qinling and partially from the eroded recycled felsic sedimentary covers of Taihang Mountain. In the late stage of Middle Jurassic (Ma'ao Formation), Taihang Mountain has been the primary source to Jiyuan basin. We conclude that the Jurassic rocks of Jiyuan basin reveal the progressive uplift and denudation processes of the Taihang Mountain.

AB  - The State of Kansas, as an energy-producing and agriculture-based state, faces problems in production of natural resources and potential pollution from their production. To coordinate information on the exploration, production, and use of coal, nuclear, petroleum, natural gas, hydro, wind, geothermal, coalbed methane, biofuel, solar, and other energy resources, the Kansas Energy Council and the University of Kansas Energy Research Center were created. Water, surface and subsurface, is the other important and maybe the most important natural resource in the welfare of the state. To ease the problems of contamination, situations are monitored by regulatory agencies: the Kansas Corporation Commission, Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture. The Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) at the University of Kansas serves as the archive for energy and natural resource data and conducts research pertinent to the exploration and exploitation of mineral resources, including energy and water. The Kansas Energy Research Center coordinates and supports energy activities. The Kansas Water Office and the staff for the Kansas Water Authority are charged with water planning and preparing reports on water problems and possible solutions. The cost of preserving the environment in a relatively pristine state really is of no concern considering the possible consequences; living conditions should be preserved to assure future generations, a suitable, sustainable, stable environment. With all the dire predictions for the future and energy-producing and pollution problems, Kansas is a model state in this modern industrial age for protecting the environment and is a leader in conservation.

AB  - Developing reliable methods to estimate stream baseflow has been a subject of interest due to its importance in catchment response and sustainable watershed management. However, to date, in the absence of complex numerical models, baseflow is most commonly estimated using statistically derived empirical approaches that do not directly incorporate physically-meaningful information. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as Genetic Programming (GP) offer unique capabilities to reduce the complexities of hydrological systems without losing relevant physical information. This study presents a simple-to-use empirical equation to estimate baseflow time series using GP so that minimal data is required and physical information is preserved. A groundwater numerical model was first adopted to simulate baseflow for a small semi-urban catchment (0.043 km(2)) located in Singapore. GP was then used to derive an empirical equation relating baseflow time series to time series of groundwater table fluctuations, which are relatively easily measured and are physically related to baseflow generation. The equation was then generalized for approximating baseflow in other catchments and validated for a larger vegetation-dominated basin located in the US (24 km(2)). Overall, this study used GP to propose a simple-to-use equation to predict baseflow time series based on only three parameters: minimum daily baseflow of the entire period, area of the catchment and groundwater table fluctuations. It serves as an alternative approach for baseflow estimation in un-gauged systems when only groundwater table and soil information is available, and is thus complementary to other methods that require discharge measurements.

AB  - Sustainable water resources management in most river basins needs appropriate techniques to implement the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources with consideration of uncertainties. In this study, first a linear fuzzy optimization model was used to find the optimal surface and groundwater withdrawal. Then, by using the results of this model, a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) was developed to determine the groundwater withdrawal, automatically. The capability of this approach is studied in the Astaneh-Kouchesfahan Plain in north of Iran. To do this, the groundwater of this Plain was simulated using MODFLOW code. Then, two fuzzy optimization methods were developed to minimize the water shortage. Results showed that the average water shortage was equal to 215 and 138 MCM according to current water withdrawal and the best solution for the fuzzy optimization model which was 22.0% and 14.6% of the water demand, respectively. The results of the optimization model were used to predict the optimal water withdrawal of the aquifer using the FIS, considering the predictor variables. These variables were applied to the developed FIS model under different scenarios in order to determine the best scenario with the highest prediction performance for water withdrawal from the aquifer. The evaluation criteria were coefficient of determination, normalized root mean square error, and the mean absolute error which were equal to 0.94, 0.26 MCM and 3.8 MCM, respectively for the best scenarios. These scenarios were able to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal and can replace the numerical optimization methods.

AB  - This paper shows how uncertainty undermines collaborative transboundary groundwater management. Focusing on the Santa Cruz Aquifer, spanning the United States-Mexico border between Arizona and Sonora, the authors describe the uncertainties within the aquifer using interviews and hydrologic studies. We discuss how data requirements and ambiguous interpretations exacerbate these uncertainties, and explain how each country's water-management culture combines with this uncertainty to create contrasting views on groundwater availability and abstraction impacts. As a result, water managers in both countries predict different impacts from pumping and recharge, and each uses that information discursively to support unilateral policies rather than to promote collaborative management.

AB  - As reliance on groundwater increases, the impact of groundwater-intensive use in internationally shared aquifers threatens not only to create negative environmental and economic externalities, but also to generate tensions between neighboring nations. Through an investigation of the shared Santa Cruz aquifer, located along the United States - Mexico border, we aim to understand factors leading to effective management of transboundary groundwaters. Specifically, we find that purely state-centric approaches provide limited explanatory value, and instead examine how national (domestic) arrangements for water management condition a country's position vis-a-vis its shared groundwaters. Polycentricism in national and subnational institutional regimes leads to gaps and overlaps in authority, limiting binational groundwater management. Concurrently, evolving institutional arrangements lead to ambiguity in decision making, yet crucially also provide opportunities for innovation in binational agenda setting and data sharing, which in turn aid in the alignment of both countries' priorities for the transboundary Santa Cruz aquifer.

AB  - Groundwater, as the world's most important reserve of available fresh water, is known to be affected by urbanization. Managing this resource in a sustainable way is critical for water resource management. Groundwater recharge rates in urban areas remain however still poorly understood and under researched and knowledge about these rates and their expected changes under increasing urbanization is therefore of primary importance. This study aims to give insight into urban groundwater recharge by performing water budget calculations for four different time periods for an urban study site in northern Switzerland. In order to take into account uncertainty in parameter values a Monte Carlo (MC) approach was carried out. Our study highlights a strong positive correlation between groundwater recharge rates and the extent of the urban area. In detail, at the study site urban areas expanded from 6% in 1880 to 44% in 2009, leading to an increase in the mean groundwater recharge rate. However, the increase amount in recharge remains uncertain and varies between 29% and 67% depending on the parameter combination originating from the MC approach. Based on our water budget calculations, the transformation of natural landscapes into impervious areas leads to an increase in groundwater recharge rates due to the reduction of evapotranspiration that more than compensates for the increase in runoff. Furthermore, water main leakages contribute to an increase in recharge rates. Overall, we demonstrate that a better understanding of groundwater recharge changes in urban areas is required to move towards a sustainable water management. We hope that this example will encourage the hydrogeological community to pay more attention to urban groundwater recharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A classical virtual combinatorial chemistry approach (CombiChem) was applied for combinatorial generation of 5590 novel structurally-similar 6-fluoroquinolone analogs by using a virtual synthetic pathway with selected primary (43) and secondary amines (130). The obtained virtual combinatorial library was filtered using an in-house developed set of cheminformatics drug-likeness filters with pre-integrated Boolean options (TRUE/FALSE) for compounds reduction/selection. The retained number (304) of fluoroquinolone analogs (with TRUE outcome) defines the drug-like chemical space (CombiData). Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) study on these 304 virtually generated 6-fluoroquinolone analogs with unknown activity values was performed using a pre-built five-parameter multiple linear regression (MLR) model developed on a set of compounds with experimentally determined activity values (R-tr = 0.8417, Rtr-cv = 0.7884). The obtained activity values for the unknown compounds together with the model results were used to define the applicability domain (AD). The obtained AD offers a good graphical representation and establishment of structure-activity relationships (SAR) which could be used for design of new 6-fluoroquinolones with possible better activity.

AB  - From the integration results of geological and geophysical data, a subsurface geological model of the Corrientes province (Argentina) that allows visualizing its deep geological structure and how it affected the Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) is presented. 44 boreholes, 21 geophysical surveys and 1366 depth data from a Bouguer gravity anomaly model have been used. The model was built from five layers easily distinguishable in the regional subsurface: basement, pre-GAS sediments (Paleozoic), GAS sediments (Triassic-Lower Cretaceous), basalts (Serra Geral Group, Lower Cretaceous) and post basaltic sediments. The resulting geometry shows a basement with a structural high, the Dorsal Asuncion-Rio Grande, where the GAS and the basaltic layer are thinner and the Mesozoic sediments rise near the surface. It is an area prone to local recharge and regional discharge of the GAS and it is in line with the latest piezometry and groundwater chemical analysis. Furthermore, two important depocenters have been identified, Corrientes and Curuzu structural high blocks, with at least 3500 m of sedimentary and volcano-sedimentary deposits that suggest the existence of significant pre-carboniferous sediment units associated to ancient extensional structures of the early Paleozoic. The proposed model allows defining a lithostratigraphic column of Corrientes and gives new criteria to redraw the southwest limit of the GAS. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Improvements in groundwater management require strategies to change human behaviour, yet there has been limited social research in the broad arena of groundwater management. This paper provides a critical review of the small but expanding literature on that topic to identify future directions for social researchers. Comprehensive search methods identified almost three hundred potentially relevant publications, which were sorted thematically and assessed in terms of their theoretical underpinning and the evidence used to support key findings. This process enabled the authors to identify a small number of high quality publications and to identify future research opportunities. The latter includes analysing how concepts of risk and sustainable yield are constructed differently by stakeholders, especially related to divisive issues concerning coal seam gas developments and reforms that reduce irrigation allocations; how governance arrangements can be improved to achieve more effective collaborative management of groundwater, especially if managed aquifer recharge is to be more widely implemented in rural agricultural contexts; and the role that trust and social norms can play in changing groundwater use practices.

AB  - A semiquantitative analysis was used to assess the impacts of water rights appropriations and allocations in the Upper Rio Grande (URG) Basin, in Colorado. The study also explores the causes and effects of the changes on collateral elements in the URG agriculture system, namely the San Luis Valley (SLV) in Colorado. Population increases, after the acquisition of the territory from 1854 to 1900, were the major cause of increased acquisitions of surface water rights. By 1912 surface waters were nearly 100% appropriated. The population continued to increase until 1930 after which it remained stable. Water users began making large increases in the number of appropriations of groundwater around 1925, with the majority of increases starting around 1935. As a result, moratoriums were placed on well development in the 1970s and 80s. Individual spikes in water rights acquisitions of surface and groundwater were associated with periodic droughts and high crop prices. Change point time series analysis identified three major periods of acquisition of waters rights: 1881-1911 for surface water, 1935-1981 for the unconfined aquifer, and 1945-1967 for the confined aquifer. Collateral effects on stream flows and agricultural acreage also were evident. The annual stream outflows from the SLV declined by 400 hm(3) after 1924, being attributed to surface water extractions. An additional reduction in outflow of 60 hm(3) from 1925 to 1963 was attributed to groundwater extraction. An increase in agricultural acreage by 80,000 ha during the period 1948-1978 fostered increases in groundwater rights acquisition from 1935-1981. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000436.

AB  - A combined approach of multivariate statistical analysis, namely factor analysis (FA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), interpretation of geochemical processes, stable water isotope data and organic micropollutants enabling to assess spatial patterns of water types was performed for a study area in Switzerland, where drinking water production is close to different potential input pathways for contamination. To avoid drinking water contamination, artificial groundwater recharge with surface water into an aquifer is used to create a hydraulic barrier between potential intake pathways for contamination and drinking water extraction wells. Inter-aquifer mixing in the subsurface is identified, where a high amount of artificial infiltrated surface water is mixed with a lesser amount of water originating from the regional flow pathway in the vicinity of drinking water extraction wells. The spatial distribution of different water types can be estimated and a conceptual system understanding is developed. Results of the multivariate statistical analysis are comparable with gained information from isotopic data and organic micropollutants analyses. The integrated approach using different kinds of observations can be easily transferred to a variety of hydrological settings to synthesise and evaluate large hydrochemical datasets. The combination of additional data with different information content is conceivable and enabled effective interpretation of hydrological processes. Using the applied approach leads to more sound conceptual system understanding acting as the very basis to develop improved water resources management practices in a sustainable way.

AB  - A new approach of modeling very low frequency-electromagnetic (VLF-EM) and vertical electrical sounding (VES) data with a view of evaluating groundwater resources potential via application of GIS-based multi-criteria technique is investigated in this study. On eight VLF-EM traverses established in the site, 40 VES locations were combed. The acquired geophysical data (VLF-EM and VES) were processed applying Fraser/Karous-Hjelt filter and Win-Resist program geophysical software to determine the area subsurface geophysical parameters. Five hydrogeologic maps were produced based on the results of the interpreted geophysical parameters. The produced hydrogeologic maps were assigned suitable weights and different rankings to the individual classes boundary within the maps using the standard Saaty's scale principle in the context of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) data mining technique. A raster-based empirical GIS model was developed for integrating the hydrogeologic maps to compute the groundwater potential index (GWPI) values in the range of 1.02-2.82 for the study area. Based on the estimated GWPI results, a final map zoning the area into low (0.0930-1.3922), medium (1.3922-1.9109) and high (1.9109-2.8173) groundwater potential classes was produced in GIS environment. The prediction accuracy of the produced potential map was established via cross-validation and in situ well correlation analysis. The results of the study established a new approach of modeling geophysical data for exploring groundwater productivity potential in the study area.

AB  - This study conducted a robust analysis on acquired 2D resistivity imaging data and borehole pumping test records to optimize groundwater potentiality mapping in Perak province, Malaysia using derived aquifer hydraulic properties. The transverse resistance (TR) parameter was determined from the interpreted 2D resistivity imaging data by applying the Dar-Zarrouk parameter equation. Linear regression and GIS techniques were used to regress the estimated values for TR parameters with the aquifer transmissivity values extracted from the geospatially produced BPT records-based aquifer transmissivity map to develop the aquifer transmissivity parameter predictive (ATPP) model. The reliability evaluated ATPP model using the Theil inequality coefficient measurement approach was used to establish geoelectrical-based hydraulic parameters (GHP) modeling equations for the modeling of transmissivity (Tr), hydraulic conductivity (K), storativity (St), and hydraulic diffusivity (D) properties. The applied GHP modeling equation results to the delineated aquifer media was used to produce aquifer potential conditioning factor maps for Tr, K, St, and D. The maps were modeled to develop an aquifer potential mapping index (APMI) model via applying the multi-criteria decision analysis-analytic hierarchy process principle. The area groundwater reservoir productivity potential model map produced based on the processed APMI model estimates in the GIS environment was found to be 71% accurate. This study establishes a good alternative approach to determine aquifer hydraulic parameters even in areas where pumping test information is unavailable using a cost effective geophysical data. The produced map can be explored for hydrological decision making.

AB  - In view of worldwide concern for the sustainability of groundwater resources, basin-wide modeling of groundwater flow is essential for the efficient planning and management of groundwater resources in a groundwater basin. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the performance of finite difference-based numerical model MODFLOW and the artificial neural network (ANN) model developed in this study in simulating groundwater levels in an alluvial aquifer system. Calibration of the MODFLOW was done by using weekly groundwater level data of 2 years and 4 months (February 2004 to May 2006) and validation of the model was done using I year of groundwater level data (June 2006 to May 2007). Calibration of the model was performed by a combination of trial-and-error method and automated calibration code PEST with a mean RMSE (root mean squared error) value of 0.62 m and a mean NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) value of 0.915. Groundwater levels at 18 observation wells were simulated for the validation period. Moreover, artificial neural network models were developed to predict groundwater levels in 18 observation wells in the basin one time step (i.e., week) ahead. The inputs to the ANN model consisted of weekly rainfall, evaporation, river stage, water level in the drain, pumping rate of the tubewells and groundwater levels in these wells at the previous time step. The time periods used in the MODFLOW were also considered for the training and testing of the developed ANN models. Out of the 174 data sets, 122 data sets were used for training and 52 data sets were used for testing. The simulated groundwater levels by MODFLOW and ANN model were compared with the observed groundwater levels. It was found that the ANN model provided better prediction of groundwater levels in the study area than the numerical model for short time-horizon predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forecasting of groundwater levels is very useful for planning integrated management of groundwater and surface water resources in a basin. In the present study, artificial neural network models have been developed for groundwater level forecasting in a river island of tropical humid region, eastern India. ANN modeling was carried out to predict groundwater levels 1 week ahead at 18 sites over the study area. The inputs to the ANN models consisted of weekly rainfall, pan evaporation, river stage, water level in the drain, pumping rate and groundwater level in the previous week, which led to 40 input nodes and 18 output nodes. Three different ANN training algorithms, viz., gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate backpropagation (GDX) algorithm, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and Bayesian regularization (BR) algorithm were employed and their performance was evaluated. As the neural network became very large with 40 input nodes and 18 output nodes, the LM and BR algorithms took too much time to complete a single iteration. Consequently, the study area was divided into three clusters and the performance evaluation of the three ANN training algorithms was done separately for all the clusters. The performance of all the three ANN training algorithms in predicting groundwater levels over the study area was found to be almost equally good. However, the performance of the BR algorithm was found slightly superior to that of the GDX and LM algorithms. The ANN model trained with BR algorithm was further used for predicting groundwater levels 2, 3 and 4 weeks ahead in the tubewells of one cluster using the same inputs. It was found that though the accuracy of predicted groundwater levels generally decreases with an increase in the lead time, the predicted groundwater levels are reasonable for the larger lead times as well.

AB  - Groundwater is the unique source of fresh water in El-Farafra Oasis, western desert, Egypt. The increasing demand of groundwater in El-Farafra Oasis has resulted in an indiscriminate exploitation of this source causing environmental hazards such as decline of groundwater levels and well interference. In this paper, the study of these problems is conducted. The methodology introduced in this paper includes application of mathematical and Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques. This situation has led to a growing realization that through good management, use of groundwater can be made more productive and sustainable. The proposed model of optimization is based on the combination of the MODFLOW with GA. The performance of the proposed model is tested on groundwater management problem (maximization of total pumping rate from an aquifer at steady-state). The results show that the GA solutions nearly agree with the solutions of other methods of previous works. Thus, it can be used to solve the management problems in groundwater. This model is used to develop the optimal pumping rate and number of wells in El-Farafra Oasis under different scenarios. The results show that under the current situation, the optimal pumping rate is 183023 m(3)/day. The second scenario assumes an increase of number of wells by 20%, the optimal rate reaches 220016 m(3)/day. The third scenario proposes pumping rate 254484 m(3)/day which equalizes an increase in the cultivated area by 4000 acres, the optimal rate reaches 258007 m(3)/day.

AB  - The present research aims to assess the geologic determinants influencing sustainable urban planning of Ismailia City at the Suez Canal Province. GIS data integration was utilized to specify geologic factors influencing the 2010 strategic urban plan. Field observations, chemical properties of shallow groundwater and remote sensing data were integrated using Geographic Information Systems. The acquired satellite images in this research were selected to be within 1990-2014 time span. It is noticed that some environmental problems which are originated following the development of urban and industrial projects in Ismailia City in addition to the extension of informal unmanaged settlement areas. These include waterlogging, salinization and land subsidence. The results of chemical analyses of water indicate exceedance of sulphate content which causes salt crust problem and severely affects the foundation resistance. Also, unexpected urban sprawl produces unplanned urban extensions which are strongly suffered by waterlogging and land subsidence. Change detection emphasized that the newly cultivated land, salt crust and informal settlement areas increased during 1990-2014 period. However, waterlogged areas decreased within the same time period. Consequently, this study recommends considering the geological determinants and environmental factors in any future planning.

AB  - A two-dimensional steady-state solute transport model is developed to simulate movement of non-point sources of pollution in anisotropic porous media. The migration of chemicals dissolved in groundwater is governed by advective-dispersive processes which are also affected by the velocity of the flowing groundwater. Therefore, groundwater flow equation is solved for hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity to approximate the average linear velocity of the fluid. The advection-dispersion is used to approximate the spatial and temporal distribution of non-reactive dissolved chemical in a flowing groundwater. A computer code is developed in MATLAB to solve the groundwater flow and solute transports equations by finite difference methods. The developed program is verified with soil-tank experimental data. The solute transport model is used to simulate non-point source of nitrate pollution in an agriculture-intensive region. Finally, the model outputs are analyzed to understand the factors that influence the pollution transport in the study area.

AB  - Integrated water resources management is a paradigm that incorporates technical, scientific, political, legislative and organizational aspects of a water system. This study presents a methodology for undertaking an integrated analysis of water systems supplied by groundwater. This methodology is here applied to examine the water system of the Altiplano region in Murcia, where the water extraction from the aquifers greatly exceeds recharge and the irrigated areas supplied by those aquifers have a very high agrarian profitability. First, the hydrological problematic of the case study was conceptualized. Then, a sectorial study on each aspect related to the water management of the system was developed. As Bayesian Networks was the chosen technique for the integrated analysis, the information obtained by the sectorial studies was translated into specific variables, which together with the relations among them, modelled the real situation. As from a hydrogeological point of view the water system is comprised of four autonomous aquifers, a Bayesian Network for every aquifer was designed. This decision-support system enables us to evaluate the impacts generated under diverse water management scenarios.

AB  - Integrated Aquifers Management (IAM) demands innovative tools and methods that are able to consider as much perspectives as possible. This research is aimed to design, apply and provide an indicator named Social Sustainable Aquifer Yield (SSAY), expressed in units of time that includes pure hydrological variables as well as social ones. The indicator is defined as the relation between the Residence Time, which is the relation between aquifer Storage (S) and Recharge (R) (S/R), and the relation between the aquifer Pumping (P) and the new variable named Aquifer Social Yield (ASY). The whole indicator is defined by this formula: (S/R)/(P/ASY). The assessment of the residence time is essential in aquifers with at least one of the following features: i) high hydraulic diffusivity, and ii) small volume of reserves. Finally, the variable ASY is defined as the average perception from the stakeholders about the maximum acceptable aquifer exploitation. This indicator has been successfully applied in the aquifers located in southern Jaen province (South Spain) belonging to the Water System SE4-Ja,n Water Supply. The results probe the high utility of the indicator, especially in regards to the public participation processes.

AB  - Water pollution and water scarcity are among the main environmental challenges faced by the European Union, and multiple stressors compromise the integrity of water resources and ecosystems. Particularly in lowland areas of northern Europe, high population density, flood protection and, especially, intensive agriculture, are important drivers of water quality degradation. In addition, future climate and land use changes may interact, with uncertain consequences for water resources. Modelling approaches have become essential to address water issues and to evaluate ecosystem management. In this work, three multi-stressor future storylines combining climatic and socio-economic changes, defined at European level, have been downscaled for the Odense Fjord catchment (Denmark), giving three scenarios: High-Tech agriculture (HT), Agriculture for Nature (AN) and Market-Driven agriculture (MD). The impacts of these scenarios on water discharge and inorganic and organic nutrient loads to the streams have been simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The results revealed that the scenario-specific climate inputs were most important when simulating hydrology, increasing river discharge in the HT and MD scenarios (which followed the high emission 8.5 representative concentration pathway, RCP), while remaining stable in the AN scenario (RCP 4.5). Moreover, discharge was the main driver of changes in organic nutrients and inorganic phosphorus loads that consequently increased in a high emission scenario. Nevertheless, both land use (via inputs of fertilizer) and climate changes affected the nitrate transport. Different levels of fertilization yielded a decrease in the nitrate load in AN and an increase in MD. In HT, however, nitrate losses remained stable because the fertilization decrease was counteracted by a flow increase. Thus, our results suggest that N loads will ultimately depend on future land use and management in an interaction with climate changes, and this knowledge is of utmost importance for the achievement of European environmental policy goals.

AB  - In Mediterranean coastal catchments, water management for preservation of pine forests and other natural areas faces particular challenges. Limited rainfall, water consumption by vegetation as well as subsidence, drainage and salt water intrusion all play an important role. Traditionally forest and water management are carried out independent of one another and do not consider water budget calculations. We show with this study that is very important to have quantitative information of all the components of the water budget as well as the size of the fresh water lenses in the aquifer to be able to integrate the water- and forest management. We use an integrated hydrologic-ecologic methodology based on easily attainable data to assess the monthly water budget of a coastal catchment, Marina Romea (Ravenna, Italy). We present detailed monthly water table records, rainfall data, drainage data, tree density and tree perimeter and use published sap flow measurements of single pine trees (Pinus Pinea) to quantify the actual transpiration of single pine trees in different periods of the year. Transpiration amounts to 10-30 l per day per tree. These values are confirmed by independent estimates of tree transpiration based on our water budget calculations: 9-34 l/tree/day. Because typically there are so many trees in planted pine forests, the total transpiration rates over the whole watershed take up a large percentage (up to 200 %) of the precipitation. In Marina Romea, four monitoring periods out of twelve, the tree transpiration is larger than precipitation. In nine monitoring periods, drainage in the watershed is larger than precipitation or tree water transpiration. The measurements and calculations show that not much freshwater is left to recharge the fresh water lens underneath Marina Romea. Monthly monitoring of groundwater table elevation and salinity in the pine forest of Marina Romea from March 2007 to February 2008 shows that the groundwater table strongly fluctuates and groundwater salinity is constantly very high (up to 17.7 g/l). Analytical calculations based on the Ghyben Herzberg Dupuit principle suggest that even a small continuous annual recharge of 15 mm could form a 2-m deep freshwater lens in the unconfined aquifer. This freshwater lens is not present in the study area and this is due to the fact that tree water transpiration and drainage take out most of the fresh water coming into the watershed. In catchments like Marina Romea, water consumption by the (natural) vegetation and seasonal differences as well as the fact that fresh water lenses are limited in salty surroundings should be taken into account in water and forest management.

AB  - To increase the potentiality of development and land reclamation activities, the Egyptian government funds the construction of a new desert road in Upper Egypt. This road connects Upper Egypt with the Red Sea Governorate. Surrounding the road is 207,000 acres of land surface which is almost flat and suitable for reclamation. To ensure the sustainability of the proposed development surrounding the road, analyses of the morphometric parameters, infiltration test and the grain size distribution, geoelectrical and hydrogeological investigations were conducted in the area. The results indicated a possibility of flash flood hazards and poor drainage condition for land reclamation activities is expected. The hydrogeological and geoelectrical investigations revealed that the unconfined Quaternary and confined Nubian Sandstone aquifers are the main aquifers in the area. The depths to water in the two aquifers range from 18 to 36 and 80 to 300 m with an average thickness of 40 and 275 m, respectively. The aquifers are made of sands and silt with clay intercalations. The total dissolved solids of water ranges between 1,700 and 5,400 mg/L, whereas the sodium absorption ratio ranges between 7 and 30 meq/L, indicating the suitability of water for irrigating medium-to high-salt-tolerant crops with proper drainage facilities. Thus, water in this area is not suitable for domestic use. Based on hydrogeological equations, the available water for extraction from the aquifers in the area is about 17.195x10(9) m(3), and this volume is not feasible to reclaim the whole proposed area for reclamation. Meanwhile, it may be possible to water small farms (not more than 60,000 acres for 50 years). Surface water source should be considered for the sustainability development of the area.

AB  - Azraq basin, being one of the largest basins in Jordan and a viable drinking water resource, witnessed a dramatic increase in water demand over the past four decades. This led to an over-abstraction from this aquifer, which in turn resulted in deterioration of its water quality. To better manage and sustain this and other aquifers, new elaborate computer codes, called ParFlow and Slim-Fast, have been used to simulate groundwater flow and contaminants' transport at Azraq basin. ParFlow is a portable and parallel processing simulator, designed for modeling multi-phase fluid flow in 3D heterogeneous porous media. This code possesses a local mesh refinement capability, uses site topography and subterranean formations and offers a variety of numerical methods for various aspects of numerical simulation, while Slim-Fast uses the random walk method to solve sub-surface transport problems of multi-phase, multi-constituent contaminant mixture. Slim-Fast was written specifically to exploit a quasi-analytical formulation to find a rapid solution for the advection transport. These codes provided means to predict the hydraulic head in the upper and middle aquifers, simulate the movement of Total Dissolved Solids (TDSs) in the upper aquifer and estimate the age of groundwater. Results from groundwater model showed that steady state drawdown at points of observation may reach 28 m, which exceeds the 15.3 m drawdown previously predicted by other formal studies. Contaminant transport model results indicated that the concentration of total dissolved solids is expected to increase slowly in the basin due to the movement of high-salinity water toward the pumping wells used for domestic purposes. Estimated values of groundwater age varied between 3000 and more than 50,000 years based on the flow direction.

AB  - Protection of water resources is a major challenge today, given that territory occupation and land use are continuously increasing. In the case of karst aquifers, its dynamic complexity requires the use of specific methodologies that allow establishing local and regional flow and transport patterns. This information is particularly necessary when springs and wells harnessed for water supply are concerned. In view of the present state of the art, this work shows a new approach based on the use of a LiCl based tracer injection test through a borehole for transport characterization from a local to a regional scale. Thus a long term tracer injection test was conducted in a particularly sensitive sector of the Egino karst massif (Basque Country, Spain). The initial displacement of tracer in the vicinity of the injection was monitored in a second borehole at a radial distance of 10.24 m. This first information, assessed by a radial divergent model, allows obtaining transport characteristic parameters in this immediate vicinity during injection. At a larger (regional) scale, the tracer reaches a highly transmissive network with mean traveling velocities to the main springs being from 4.3 to 13.7 m/h. The responses obtained, particularly clear in the main spring used for water supply, and the persistence of part of the tracer in the injection zone, pose reconsidering the need for their protection. Thus, although the test allows establishing the 24-h isochrone, which is the ceiling value in present European vulnerability approaches, the results obtained" advise widening the zone to protect in order to guarantee water quality in the springs. Overall, this stimulus-response test allows furthering the knowledge on the dynamics of solute transport in karst aquifers and is a particularly useful tool in studies related to source vulnerability and protection in such a complex medium.

AB  - A community numerical ocean model is used to extend the understanding of wind-driven circulation in small upland lakes. A 3D model of a case study lake (Llyn Conwy, Wales, UK) is calibrated against measured velocity profiles via adjustment of the bottom roughness coefficient. Validation against a separate set of measured velocity profiles confirms the ability of the model to resolve key features of the flow field. Sensitivity analysis shows that the velocity field responds rapidly to changes in the wind forcing. Analysis of the gross circulation using Empirical Orthogonal Functions reveals a persistent two-gyre circulation pattern in the upper half layer of the water column driven by the interaction of wind and bathymetry. At the bottom, the flow is characterised by locally strong currents and analysis of vertical circulation over short time scales shows strong currents in the deepest parts of the lake basin and the responsiveness of the water column to changes in wind speed and direction. Even in small lakes, the assumption of uniform wind stress across the water surface is not always justified and topographic sheltering or other catchment roughness effects give rise to heterogeneity in the wind field. An idealized experiment for the case study lake shows that differences in circulation emerge if the wind stress is allowed to vary across the lake. Energetic wind forcing in upland areas can drive an energetic lake circulation that has important implications for mixing and sediment dynamics. 3D numerical modelling of wind-driven circulation should be more widely used to provide insights into physical limnology to support a wide range of ecological, biogeochemical and palaeoenvironmental studies.

AB  - Due to the dynamic flow exchange between a stream and a connected water- table aquifer, a physically based hydrologic model is an important tool for the design of conjunctive use of surface and ground waters. It is needed to develop sound plans for sustainable use of the groundwater with minimal undesirable effects. This article reports an investigation of the component (module) that describes the stream-aquifer flow exchange in several groundwater simulators. The study indicates that the module may not have a solid physical basis when used in large-scale regional studies to estimate the stream-aquifer flow exchange. The component relies upon an empirical parameter known as the leakance coefficient. It is demonstrated that neglecting river penetration of the aquifer can lead to non-negligible errors in estimation of seepage. In addition the leakance coefficient (dimension inverse of a time) is not constant in time but varies with the conditions in the river and in the surrounding aquifer. A potential, practical and simple alternative is presented.

AB  - To achieve water resource sustainability in the water-limited southwestern US, it is critical to understand the potential effects of proposed forest thinning on the hydrology of semi-arid basins, where disturbances to headwater catchments can cause significant changes in the local water balance components and basinwise streamflows. In Arizona, the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) is being developed with the goal of restoring 2.4 million acres of ponderosa pine along the Mogollon Rim. Using the physically based, spatially distributed triangulated irregular network (TIN)-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS) model, we examine the potential impacts of the 4FRI on the hydrology of Tonto Creek, a basin in the Verde-Tonto-Salt (VTS) system, which provides much of the water supply for the Phoenix metropolitan area. Long-term (20-year) simulations indicate that forest removal can trigger significant shifts in the spatiotemporal patterns of various hydrological components, causing increases in net radiation, surface temperature, wind speed, soil evaporation, groundwater recharge and runoff, at the expense of reductions in interception and shading, transpiration, vadose zone moisture and snow water equivalent, with south-facing slopes being more susceptible to enhanced atmospheric losses. The net effect will likely be increases in mean and maximum streamflow, particularly during E1 Nino events and the winter months, and chiefly for those scenarios in which soil hydraulic conductivity has been significantly reduced due to thinning operations. In this particular climate, forest thinning can lead to net loss of surface water storage by vegetation and snowpack, increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems and populations to larger and more frequent hydrologic extreme conditions on these semi-arid systems.

AB  - The changes in seawater volumes caused by seawater intrusion are often neglected in coastal aquifer management studies. The conditions under which this can result in significant water balance errors are not well understood. Interface movements also influence temporal trends in coastal aquifer water levels, but there is little guidance on this effect. In this study, we use steady-state, sharp-interface, analytic modelling to generate idealised relationships between seawater volume, freshwater volume and water levels. The approach assumes quasi-equilibrium conditions, which are evaluated using a selection of transient, dispersive simulations. The results demonstrate that seawater volume changes can influence significantly coastal aquifer water level trends, relative to the corresponding non-coastal aquifer situation, particularly within deep aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity and low net recharge. It is also shown that seawater volume changes can be a significant component of coastal aquifer water balances, e.g., relative to freshwater discharge to the sea, especially within deep aquifers characterised by low hydraulic conductivity and low freshwater discharge. Transient simulations show that steady-state conditions are a reasonable approximation for a range of transient seawater intrusion situations, including two of the three cases considered in this analysis. We conclude that changes in seawater volumes should be included routinely in coastal aquifer water balances. Also, temporal trends in coastal aquifer water levels may not provide an adequate measure of freshwater storage trends. It follows that the assessment of coastal aquifer condition should consider groundwater levels relative to the hydraulic head imposed by the ocean, accounting for density effects.

AB  - Water inrush from a karst aquifer threatens mine safety in North China because of the special hydrogeological conditions. This paper systematically analyzes the regional hydrogeological conditions of the Cambrian-Ordovician limestone karst aquifer in the Yuxian Basin. Conceptual and mathematical models of karst water flow system are established, and the karst water flow system is simulated by the finite-difference method. The numerical model is checked using hydraulic head from karst water observation holes, and the sensitivity of hydrogeological parameters is analyzed. Further, the risk of water inrush from the karst aquifer underlying the coal seam in the second mining area of the Beiyangzhuang Mine in the basin is evaluated by the water inrush coefficient method. Based on the critical hydraulic head for mining safety, the rate of mine dewatering is simulated for the three stages of the mining plan with the numerical model. The results show that the risk of water inrush in the second mining area is high. The rate of dewatering in the three stages without grouting is 1300, 1860, and 2050 m(3)/h, respectively, and with local grouting is 1020, 1550, and 1700 m(3)/h, respectively. Dewatering combined with grouting not only ensures coal mine safety, but also significantly reduces the rate of dewatering. The prediction method of mine dewatering has practical significance in engineering applications.

AB  - Prediction of Ground Water Level (GWL) is extremely important for sustainable use and management of ground water resource. The motivations for this work is to understand the relationship between Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived terrestrial water change (Delta TWS) data and GWL, so that Delta TWS could be used as a proxy measurement for GWL. In our study, we have selected five observation wells from different geographic regions in India. The datasets are unevenly spaced time series data which restricts us from applying standard time series methodologies and therefore in order to model and predict GWL with the help of Delta TWS, we have built Linear Regression Model (LRM), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Comparative performances of LRM, SVR and ANN have been evaluated with the help of correlation coefficient (rho) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the actual and fitted (for training dataset) or predicted (for test dataset) values of GWL. It has been observed in our study that Delta TWS is highly significant variable to model GWL and the amount of total variations in GWL that could be explained with the help of Delta TWS varies from 36.48% to 74.28% (0.3648 <= R-2 <= 0.7428). We have found that for the model GWL similar to Delta TWS, for both training and test dataset, performances of SVR and ANN are better than that of LRM in terms of rho and RMSE. It also has been found in our study that with the inclusion of meteorological variables along with Delta TWS as input parameters to model GWL, the performance of SVR improves and it performs better than ANN. These results imply that for modelling irregular time series GWL data, Delta TWS could be very useful. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater is crucial for the livelihoods and food security of millions of people, and yet, knowledge formation in the field of groundwater has remained asymmetrical. While, scientific knowledge in the discipline (hydrology and hydrogeology) has advanced remarkably, relatively little is known about the socio-economic impacts and institutions that govern groundwater use. This paper therefore has two objectives. The first is to provide a balanced view of the plus and the down side of groundwater use, especially in agriculture. In doing so, examples are drawn from countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Spain and Mexico-all of which make very intensive use of groundwater. Second, institutions and policies that influence groundwater use are analyzed in order to understand how groundwater is governed in these countries and whether successful models of governance could be replicated elsewhere. Finally, the authors argue that there is a need for a paradigm shift in the way groundwater is presently perceived and managed-from management to governance mode. In this attempt, a number of instruments such as direct regulation, indirect policy levers, livelihood adaptation and people's participation will have to be deployed simultaneously in a quest for better governance.

AB  - This study explores groundwater management policies and the effect of modeling assumptions on the projected performance of those policies. The study compares an optimal economic allocation for groundwater use subject to streamflow constraints, achieved by a central planner with perfect foresight, with a uniform tax on groundwater use and a uniform quota on groundwater use. The policies are compared with two modeling approaches, the Optimal Control Model (OCM) and the Multi-Agent System Simulation (MASS). The economic decision models are coupled with a physically based representation of the aquifer using a calibrated MODFLOW groundwater model. The results indicate that uniformly applied policies perform poorly when simulated with more realistic, heterogeneous, myopic, and self-interested agents. In particular, the effects of the physical heterogeneity of the basin and the agents undercut the perceived benefits of policy instruments assessed with simple, single-cell groundwater modeling. This study demonstrates the results of coupling realistic hydrogeology and human behavior models to assess groundwater management policies. The Republican River Basin, which overlies a portion of the Ogallala aquifer in the High Plains of the United States, is used as a case study for this analysis.

AB  - Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis ( TB), infects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and is the leading cause of mortality due to infectious disease. Current TB therapy involves a regimen of four antibiotics taken over a six month period. Patient compliance, cost of drugs and increasing incidence of drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains have added urgency to the development of novel TB therapies. Eradication of TB is affected by the ability of the bacterium to survive up to decades in a dormant state primarily in hypoxic granulomas in the lung and to cause recurrent infections. Methods: The availability of M. tuberculosis genome- wide DNA microarrays has lead to the publication of several gene expression studies under simulated dormancy conditions. However, no single model best replicates the conditions of human pathogenicity. In order to identify novel TB drug targets, we performed a meta- analysis of multiple published datasets from gene expression DNA microarray experiments that modeled infection leading to and including the dormant state, along with data from genome- wide insertional mutagenesis that examined gene essentiality. Results: Based on the analysis of these data sets following normalization, several genome wide trends were identified and used to guide the selection of targets for therapeutic development. The trends included the significant up- regulation of genes controlled by devR, down- regulation of protein and ATP synthesis, and the adaptation of two- carbon metabolism to the hypoxic and nutrient limited environment of the granuloma. Promising targets for drug discovery were several regulatory elements ( devR/ devS, relA, mprAB), enzymes involved in redox balance and respiration, sulfur transport and fixation, pantothenate, isoprene, and NAD biosynthesis. The advantages and liabilities of each target are discussed in the context of enzymology, bacterial pathways, target tractability, and drug development. Conclusion: Based on our bioinformatics analysis and additional discussion of in- depth biological rationale, several novel anti- TB targets have been proposed as potential opportunities to improve present therapeutic treatments for this disease.

AB  - Irrigation strategies which maximize crop yield while preventing salt from leaching to the groundwater or undesirable salt increases in the root zone are computed by using a one-dimensional simulation/optimization management model. The included constraint equations maintain a water volume balance and salt transport in the unsaturated zone. Implicit finite difference forms of the unsaturated water flow equation (Richards' equation), the diffusion-convection solute transport equation, functions describing the hydraulic properties of the medium, a root extraction function, and other constraints are used. The model uses a large discretization in time. A cyclic prediction and correction type of approach is adopted to eliminate the inaccuracy that would otherwise result from the coarse discretization. As a result of the procedure presented, intercell water and mass flux rates in the optimization model have the same accuracy as those in a more finely discretized simulation model. The model is applied to a research farm in Huntington, Utah, where salty water is used for irrigation. In that process detailed soil water and salt profiles are computed and spatially distributed moisture content and concentration constraints are satisfied.

AB  - Aquifer overexploitation is widely used to describe negative effects on groundwater resources but has no agreed scientific definition. Usually viewed as a situation where average aquifer abstraction exceeds average recharge, a diagnosis of groundwater overdraft calls upon specific hydrogeological instruments, based on the groundwater balance approach. An analytical method for assessing changes in water flows and stocks through time and space, groundwater balance is also a tool for the investigation of knowledge construction and its embeddedness within power relations. We propose to discuss the politics of groundwater overexploitation diagnoses in Syria and more specifically the Orontes River Basin prior to the 2011 uprising and subsequent conflict. Groundwater overdraft at the national level became a matter of concern in official discourse in the late 1990s as diagnoses of groundwater overexploitation became commonplace in international reports. The steady increase in groundwater abstraction in relation to Syria's centralised agricultural planning from the 1960s onward had undeniable consequences on the hydro-social system. However, the way diagnoses of groundwater overexploitation - in particular groundwater balances - were constructed and used to support water policies implemented from the mid-1990s onwards question the rationalities and interests lying behind technical arguments and actions.

AB  - In vivo the poly(A) signal not only directs 3'-end processing but also controls the rate and extent of transcription. Thus, upon crossing the poly( A) signal RNA polymerase II first pauses and then terminates. We show that the G/U-rich region of the poly(A) signal, although required for termination in vivo, is not required for poly(A)-dependent pausing either in vivo or in vitro. Consistent with this, neither CstF, which recognizes the G/U-rich element, nor the polymerase CTD, which binds CstF, is required for pausing. The only part of the poly(A) signal required to direct the polymerase to pause is the AAUAAA hexamer. The effect of the hexamer on the polymerase is long lasting-in many situations polymerases over 1 kb downstream of the hexamer continue to exhibit delayed progress down the template in vivo. The hexamer is the first part of the poly(A) signal to emerge from the polymerase and may play a role independent of the rest of the poly(A) signal in paving the way for subsequent events such as 3'-end processing and termination of transcription.

AB  - An effective evaluation system can provide specific and practical suggestions to the deep groundwater management. But such kind of evaluation system has not been proposed in China. In this study, an evaluation index system is specifically developed to evaluate deep groundwater management efficiency. It is composed of three first-level indicators (law enforcement capability, management ability, and management effectiveness) and eleven second-level indicators. The second-level indicators include seven mandatory indicators and four optional indicators. Piecewise linear function is used to normalize the quantitative indicators, and expert scoring method and questionnaire survey method are used to normalize the qualitative indicators. Then a comprehensive indicator weighting evaluation method is used to evaluate the first-level indicators and the target topic. A case study is carried out to evaluate deep groundwater management efficiency in Tianjin City. According to the evaluation score in each period, the management efficiency of every district in Tianjin City gradually improved. The overall evaluation score in the early deep groundwater extraction period is 0.12. After a series of deep groundwater protection efforts, this score reached to 0.61 in 2007, and met the regulation criteria. The evaluation results also showed that the further groundwater management efforts in Tianjin City should be focused on building a dynamic database to collect comprehensive deep well-log data; and on a reasonable design and distribution of the groundwater monitoring network. It demonstrated that the index system is suitable to locate the deficiencies of current groundwater management systems and to guide further improvements. It can then be used to protect deep groundwater.

AB  - Although the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to monitor groundwater storage changes has become commonplace, our evaluation suggests that careful processing of the GRACE data is necessary to extract a representative signal especially in regions with significant surface water storage (i.e., lakes/reservoirs). In our study, we use cautiously processed data sets, including GRACE, lake altimetry, and model soil moisture, to reduce scaling factor bias and compare GRACE-derived groundwater storage changes to in situ groundwater observations over parts of East Africa. Over the period 2007-2010, a strong correlation between in situ groundwater storage changes and GRACE groundwater estimates (Spearman's rho = 0.6) is found. Piecewise trend analyses for the GRACE groundwater estimates reveal significant negative storage changes that are attributed to groundwater use and climate variability. Further analysis comparing groundwater and satellite precipitation data sets permits identification of regional groundwater characterization. For example, our results identify potentially permeable and/or shallow groundwater systems underlying Tanzania and deep and/or less permeable groundwater systems underlying the Upper Nile basin. Regional groundwater behaviors in the semiarid regions of Northern Kenya are attributed to hydraulic connections to recharge zones outside the subbasin boundary. Our results prove the utility of applying GRACE in monitoring groundwater resources in hydrologically complex regions that are undersampled and where policies limit data accessibility.

AB  - Groundwater has been used for domestic and irrigation needs from time immemorial. Yet its nature and occurrence have always possessed a certain mystery because water below the land surface is invisible and relatively inaccessible. The influence of this mystery lingers in some tenets that govern groundwater law. With the birth of modern geology during the late nineteenth century, groundwater science became recognized in its own right. Over the past two centuries, groundwater has lost its shroud of mystery, and its scientific understanding has gradually grown hand-in-hand with its development for human use. Groundwater is a component of the hydrological cycle, vital for human sustenance. Its annual renewability from precipitation is limited, and its chemical quality is vulnerable to degradation by human action. In many parts of the world, groundwater extraction is known to greatly exceed its renewability. Consequently, its rational management to benefit present and future generations is a matter of deep concern for many nations. Groundwater management is a challenging venture, requiring an integration of scientific knowledge with communal will to adapt to constraints of a finite common resource. As scientists and policy makers grapple with the tasks of groundwater management, it is instructive to reflect on the evolution of groundwater knowledge from its initial phase of demystification at the beginning of the nineteenth century, through successive phases of technological conquest, scientific integration, discovery of unintended consequences and the present recognition of an imperative for judicious management. The following retrospective provides a broad context for unifying the technical contributions that make up this focus issue on groundwater resources, climate and vulnerability.

AB  - A review of water resources in Egypt indicates that Nile water is fully utilized and the available quantity could potentially decrease by approximately 19% due to proposed water usage by neighboring countries. Seawater desalination and groundwater extraction are the only options to increase Egypt's water supply. The extraction and desalination of brackish groundwater is suggested to develop sustainable decentralized communities. A review of seven main hydro-geological systems across six regions in Egypt is conducted to identify areas with access to brackish groundwater and aquifers are ranked on the potential for sustainable development using multi-criteria analysis based on literature data for productivity, renewability, groundwater depth and development potential. Approximately 55% of Egypt's area has access to brackish groundwater, 47% of which has access to aquifers with moderate to high potential for development. Five high priority areas have been identified for establishing decentralized communities based on brackish groundwater extraction: Areas with access to the Nubian aquifer, the Quaternary aquifer in the central parts of the Sinai Peninsula, in the vicinity of the Nile River in the Eastern Desert and the Western Desert south of Cairo, and the coastal aquifers along the north west Mediterranean coast and the Suez Gulf.

AB  - As irrigation in Egypt by far is the most significant water user, fertilizer-drawn forward osmosis (FDFO) is a valid option to increase the availability of freshwater from brackish water. Although most of Egypt's area has access to brackish groundwater, groundwater in Egypt is not well exploited due to its salinity. FDFO holds high potential as it can make irrigation water available at lower energy than the currently available technologies, and is less vulnerable to operational issues such as membrane fouling, optimizes fertilizers application, and saves on labor cost. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential application of FDFO desalination for brackish groundwater in Egypt. For sustainability reasons, five selection criteria were outlined and two locations have been suggested for potential application. The study demonstrated that the proposed scheme is suitable for the two selected areas.

AB  - Groundwater desalination could be a possible solution to Egypt's water scarcity problem through applying state-of-the-art desalination technologies. This work investigated a recently developed sustainable desalination technology which is fertilizer drawn forward osmosis (FDFO). In this work, ammonium sulfate was selected as a draw solution being a commercial, inexpensive, and efficient Egyptian fertilizer. Three commercially available Forward Osmosis (FO) membranes were tested for baseline flux. The best membrane was selected for further experimentation. A real Egyptian brackish groundwater sample from El Tor in Sinai was used as the feed solution. Performance has been assessed by the water flux, reverse permeation, and the forward rejection of the feed solutes. Porifera's commercial FO membrane proved to be the best membrane with respect to baseline flux. It was chosen for further experimentation. Water flux and ammonium sulfate concentration can be correlated logarithmically. Further increase in ammonium sulfate concentration decreases water flux gradually due to increased severity of concentration polarization effects that take place at high draw solution concentration. Specific Reverse Solute Flux (SRSF) values did not exceed 0.18g/l for both <ion, a phenomenon that could be attributed to thermodynamic influence. SRSF is almost constant irrespective of ammonium sulfate concentration. While increasing draw solution concentration lead to increasing Na+ ion rejection, it caused a significant decline in Cl- ion rejection. This phenomenon could be probably associated to an ion exchange mechanism and the membrane surface charge. In conclusion, the scheme studied showed that ammonium sulfate is an efficient draw solution for FDFO process using Porifera's commercial FO membrane exhibiting high osmotic pressure, low reverse solute permeation, and remarkable rejection of feed solute.

AB  - The identification of specific aquifers that supply water to river systems is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of the rivers' hydrochemistry, particularly in arid and semiarid environments where river flow may be discontinuous. There are multiple methods to identify the source of river water. In this study of the River Andarax, in the Southeast of Spain, an analysis of natural tracers (physico-chemical parameters, uranium, radium and radon) in surface water and groundwater indicates that chemical parameters and uranium clearly identify the areas where there is groundwater-surface water interaction. The concentration of uranium found in-the river defines two areas: the headwaters with U concentrations of 2 mu g L-1 and the lower reaches, with U of 6 mu g L-1. Furthermore, variation in the U-234/U-238 isotopic ratio allowed us to detect the influence that groundwater from the carbonate aquifer has on surface water in the headwaters of the river, where the saline content is lower and the water has a calcium bicarbonate facies. The concentration of Ra-226 and Rn-222 are low in the surface waters: <1.6 x 10(-6) mu g L-1 and <5.1 x 10(-12) mu g L-1, respectively. There is a slight increase in the lower reaches where the water has a permanent flow, greater salinity and a calcium-magnesium-sulphate facies. All this is favoured by the influence of groundwater from the detritic aquifer on the surface waters. The results of this study indicate the utility in the use of physico-chemical and radiological data conjointly as tracers of groundwater-surface water interaction in semiarid areas where the lithology of aquifers is diverse (carbonate and detritic) and where evaporitic rocks are present.

AB  - Groundwater degradation through abstraction, contamination, etc., shows a world-wide increase and has been of growing concern for the past decades. In this light, the stable isotopes of the water molecule (delta(18)O and delta(2)H) from a hard-rock aquifer in the Maheshwaram watershed (Andhra Pradesh, India) were studied. This small watershed (53 km(2)) underlain by granite, is endorheic and representative of agricultural land-use in India, with more than 700 bore wells in use. In such a watershed, the effect of overpumping can be severe and the environmental effects of water abstraction and contamination are of vital importance. A detailed and dynamic understanding of groundwater sources and flow paths in this watershed thus is a major issue for both researchers and water managers, especially with regards to water quality as well as the delimitation of resources and long-term sustainability. To this end, the input from monsoon-precipitation was monitored over two cycles, as well as measuring spatial and temporal variations in delta(18)O and delta(2)H in the groundwater and in precipitation. Individual recharge from the two monsoon periods was identified, leading to identification of periods during which evaporation affects groundwater quality through a higher concentration of salts and stable isotopes in the return flow. Such evaporation is further affected by land-use, rice paddies having the strongest evapotranspiration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In mountain headwaters, climate and land use changes affect short and long term site water budgets with resultant impacts on landslide risk, hydropower generation, and sustainable agriculture. To project hydrologic change associated with climate and land use changes in the Himalaya Mountains, we used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) calibrated for the Tamor and Seti River basins located at eastern and western margins of Nepal. Future climate change was modeled using averaged temperature and precipitation for 2080 derived from Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (B1, A1B and A2) of 16 global circulation models (GCMs). Land use change was modeled spatially and included expansion of (1) agricultural land, (2) grassland, and (3) human settlement area that were produced by considering existing land use with projected changes associated with viability of elevation and slope characteristics of the basins capable of supporting different land use type. From these simulations, higher annual stream discharge was found for all GCM-derived scenarios compared to a baseline simulation with maximum increases of 13 and 8% in SRES-A2 and SRES-A1 B for the Tamor and Seti basins, respectively. On seasonal basis, we assessed higher precipitation during monsoon season in all scenarios that corresponded with higher stream discharge of 72 and 68% for Tamor and Seti basins, respectively. This effect appears to be geographically important with higher influence in the eastern Tamor basin potentially due to longer and stronger monsoonal period of that region. However, we projected minimal changes in stream discharge for the land use scenarios potentially due to higher water transmission to groundwater reservoirs associated with fractures of the Himalaya Mountains rather than changes in surface runoff. However, when combined the effects of climate and land use changes, discharge was moderately increased indicating counteracting mechanisms of hydrologic yield in these mountains. Better understanding of potential hydrologic response to climate and land use changes in these basins might be crucial for national and transnational water management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Karst aquifers in semi-arid regions, like Queren double dagger a-Silves (Portugal), are particularly vulnerable to climate variability. For the first time in this region, the temporal structure of a groundwater-level time series (1985-2010) was explored using the continuous wavelet transform. The investigation focused on a set of four piezometers, two at each side of the S. Marcos-Quarteira fault, to demonstrate how each of the two sectors of the aquifer respond to climate-induced patterns. Singular spectral analysis applied to an extended set of piezometers enabled identification of several quasi-periodic modes of variability, with periods of 6.5, 4.3, 3.2 and 2.6 years, which can be explained by low-frequency climate patterns. The geologic forcing accounts for similar to 15 % of the differential variability between the eastern and western sectors of the aquifer. The western sector displays spatially homogenous piezometric variations, large memory effects and low-pass filtering characteristics, which are consistent with relatively large and uniform values of water storage capacity and transmissivity properties. In this sector, the 6.5-year mode of variability accounts for similar to 70 % of the total variance of the groundwater levels. The eastern sector shows larger spatial and temporal heterogeneity, is more reactive to short-term variations, and is less influenced by the low-frequency components related to climate patterns.

AB  - The cumulative impacts of incremental development present governments all over the world with major difficulties. Well-intended strategic approaches often fail, in whole or in part. In Australia, a joint Federal/State agreement in 1992 initiated reforms of State environmental legislation and policy, which led to the Council of Australian Governments Water Reform Framework 1994-an agreement to introduce comprehensive water reforms targeted at both financial and environmental issues. The Murray-Darling Basin, Australia's largest catchment, overlaps four States plus the small Australian Capital Territory. In 1995 pressing problems of land and water degradation, and the decline of widespread and important environmental values in the Basin, led only to a cap (an administrative limit or ceiling) on river water extraction, even though the importance of the surface water/groundwater connection was evident. Moreover, State Governments have been extremely slow to implement core groundwater reforms added to the Framework in 1996-with some important elements not yet implemented after 12 years. This delay, combined with the failure of States to implement commitments to the precautionary management of natural resources, has magnified the environmental and economic crisis facing the Basin. This crisis appears likely to worsen if current climate change predictions eventuate. Recent initiatives by the Australian Government acknowledge past procrastination, and provide a new administrative framework-an approach will only work if backed by political intelligence and will-power, and good-will and cooperation amongst State premiers. These factors have been absent in the past. The paper concludes with key recommendations aimed at comprehensive and integrated management of the cumulative impacts of incremental water-related development on a catchment-by-catchment basis.

AB  - Groundwater is important for domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. As the city has developed in a coastal environment, the issue of the fresh water supply must be solved for continuous development. The aim of this study was to quantitatively estimate the risk of groundwater salinization in the Ho Chi Minh area due to saline water intrusion into the main coastal aquifer (the Upper Pliocene aquifer) based on field monitoring data, and to evaluate the sustainability of the city with respect to groundwater resources. From the national monitoring database, water level data were obtained for the last 10 years (2000 to 2009), and a total of 33 hydrogeochemical and isotope data sets were obtained from the aquifer. The sustainability of Ho Chi Minh City with respect to the groundwater supply was quantitatively evaluated at an aquifer scale using groundwater sustainability indicators (GWSIs) suggested by the UNESCO/IAEA/IAH Working Group. The results indicated that groundwater in the southern region, part of the western region, and the area along the Saigon riverside was of poor quality, with very high total dissolved solids (> 1,000 mg/L) and high concentrations of Cl and Fe, exceeding the World Health Organization's drinking water guidelines. The Br:Cl ratios and the delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of the samples indicated that the salinization of groundwater resulted mainly from mixing with seawater over a long period. During 2004-2009, the saline boundary moved inland, with the farthest distance reaching similar to 3.2 km. The long-term abstraction of groundwater, which has been much greater than its recharge capability, is probably causing the decline in water level (in 39% of the aquifer area), the degradation of groundwater quality (in 62% of the area), and the continuously expanding saline water intrusion (by 7.4% in 5 years). Thus, for the sustainable development of Ho Chi Minh City, in addition to passive measures to regulate over-pumping and pollution controls, active measures should be considered to prevent further seawater intrusion and to increase groundwater recharge through artificial recharge or better management of aquifer recharge (MAR).

AB  - This paper proposes an integrated (hybrid) Artificial Neural Network-Bayesian (ANN-B) modelling approach to improve the accuracy of predicting seasonal water allocation prices in Australia's Murry Irrigation Area, which is part of one of the world's largest interconnected water markets. Three models (basic, intermediate and full), accommodating different levels of data availability, were considered. Data were analyzed using both ANN and hybrid ANN-B approaches. Using the ANN-B modelling approach, which can simulate complex and non-linear processes, water allocation prices were predicted with a high degree of accuracy (R-BASIC = 0.93, R-INTER. = 0.96 and R-FULL = 0.99); this was a higher level of accuracy than realized using ANN. This approach can potentially be integrated with online data systems to predict water allocation prices, enable better water allocation trade decisions, and improve the productivity and profitability of irrigated agriculture.

AB  - The Ansedonia promontory (southern Tuscany, Italy) is characterized by the presence of fish farms that pump thermal saline groundwater. The water is extracted from a carbonate aquifer with high permeability due to fracturing and karstification that is also exploited for irrigation purposes and domestic use. Such exploitation has led to the degradation of groundwater quality, producing conflict among the different users. The conceptualization of the aquifer allowed the development of a 3D finite element density-dependent numerical model using the FEFLOW code. The slightly negative freshwater budget in the very humid hydrologic year of 2004-2005 revealed that the aquifer was overexploited, especially due to the extraction of freshwater (along with seawater) from fish farm wells and pumping from public supply wells. The model was also used to forecast the quantitative and qualitative evolution of resources over time, thus testing the effects of different management hypotheses. Results demonstrate that the sustainable management of the aquifer mostly depends on withdrawals from public supply wells; the quantity extracted by fish farms only significantly affects the freshwater/saltwater interface and, locally, the salinity of groundwater. Actions to counteract seawater intrusion are proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Arab region is characterized by arid and semi-arid conditions with very limited renewable water resources. Most of the surface water comes from transboundary streams and most of the groundwater resources are fossil in nature. Water quality degradation and excessive use of pesticides and herbicides in agriculture pose severe environmental and health risks. The underlying research is a joint effort between Cairo University and the Technical University of Berlin to develop technologies and strategies for sustainable pesticide-free agriculture using saline or brackish water. This project builds on a previously implemented project in Spain by the German research partner that introduced the concept of Watergy, which presents an integrated desalination horticulture solar greenhouse. In this current research, the Watergy greenhouse is further developed to meet more arid climate requirements, reduce construction costs, and increase resource utilization efficiency. Several lab-scale experiments and a 100 m(2) prototype were built in Egypt to optimize the process and answer research questions. Lessons learned from this project provided guidelines on the development of the most efficient approach of desalination and water management in the system, devised a cost-effective and efficient heat exchanger using low-cost local material, and established the feasibility of the system in the arid climate together with prospects for wider applications. The proposed greenhouse was estimated to be able to save in irrigation water 40% for cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, and 50% for bell peppers. Maximum crop yield can be achieved at extended upper salinity levels using the proposed greenhouse as follows: from 1,000 to 1,700 mg/L for cherry tomatoes; from 960 to 2,000 mg/L for bell peppers; and from 1,600 to 2,700 mg/L for cucumbers.

AB  - Accurate and reliable groundwater level forecasting models can help ensure the sustainable use of a watershed's aquifers for urban and rural water supply. In this paper, a Self-Organizing-Map (SOM)-based clustering technique was used to identify spatially homogeneous clusters of groundwater level (GWL) data for a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to model one and multi-step-ahead GWLs. The wavelet transform (WT) was also used to extract dynamic and multi-scale features of the non-stationary GWL, runoff and rainfall time series. The performance of the FFNN model was compared to the newly proposed combined WT-FFNN model and also the conventional linear forecasting method of ARIMAX (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous input). GWL predictions were investigated under three different scenarios. The results indicated that the proposed FFNN model coupled with the SOM-based clustering method decreased the dimensionality of the input variables and consequently the complexity of the FFNN models. On the other hand, the application of the wavelet transform to GWL data increased the performance of the FFNN model up to 15.3% in average by revealing the dominant periods of the process.

AB  - The River Bush must reach a standard of good ecological potential (GEP) by 2015 due to the requirements of the water framework directive. The role of sediments within a water body is extremely important to all aspects of a river's regime. The aim of this research is to investigate the effects of Altnahinch Dam on sediment distribution in the River Bush (a heavily modified water body) with comparison made against the Glendun River (an unmodified water body). Samples collected from the rivers were analysed by physical (pebble count, sieve analysis) and statistical methods (ANOVA, GRADISTAT). An increase in fine sediments upstream of the dam provides evidence that the dam is impacting sediment distribution. Downstream effects are not shown to be significant. The output of this study also implies similar impacts at other drinking water storage impoundments. This research recommends that a sediment management plan be put in place for Altnahinch Dam and that further studies be carried-out concentrating on fine sediment distribution upstream of the dam.

AB  - For the development of sustainable and realistic water security, generating information on the behaviours, characteristics, and drivers of users, as well as on the resource itself, is essential. In this paper we present a methodology for collecting qualitative and quantitative data on water use practices through semi-structured interviews. This approach facilitates the collection of detailed information on actors' decisions in a convenient and cost-effective manner. Semi-structured interviews are organised around a topic guide, which helps lead the conversation in a standardised way while allowing sufficient opportunity for relevant issues to emerge. In addition, they can be used to obtain certain types of quantitative data. While not as accurate as direct measurements, they can provide useful information on local practices and users' insights. We present an application of the methodology on farmer water use in two districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India. By means of 100 farmer interviews, information was collected on various aspects of irrigation practices, including irrigation water volumes, irrigation cost, water source, and their spatial variability. Statistical analyses of the information, along with data visualisation, are also presented, indicating a significant variation in irrigation practices both within and between districts. Our application shows that semi-structured interviews are an effective and efficient method of collecting both qualitative and quantitative information for the assessment of drivers, behaviours, and their outcomes in a data-scarce region. The collection of this type of data could significantly improve insights on water resources, leading to more realistic management options and increased water security in the future.

AB  - Understanding water user behavior and its potential outcomes is important for the development of suitable water resource management options. Computational models are commonly used to assist water resource management decision making; however, while natural processes are increasingly well modeled, the inclusion of human behavior has lagged behind. Improved representation of irrigation water user behavior within models can provide more accurate and relevant information for irrigation management in the agricultural sector. This paper outlines a model that conceptualizes and proceduralizes observed farmer irrigation practices, highlighting impacts and interactions between the environment and behavior. It is developed using a bottom-up approach, informed through field experience and farmer interaction in the state of Uttar Pradesh, northern India. Observed processes and dynamics were translated into parsimonious algorithms, which represent field conditions and provide a tool for policy analysis and water management. The modeling framework is applied to four districts in Uttar Pradesh and used to evaluate the potential impact of changes in climate and irrigation behavior on water resources and farmer livelihood. Results suggest changes in water user behavior could have a greater impact on water resources, crop yields, and farmer income than changes in future climate. In addition, increased abstraction may be sustainable but its viability varies across the study region. By simulating the feedbacks and interactions between the behavior of water users, irrigation officials and agricultural practices, this work highlights the importance of directly including water user behavior in policy making and operational tools to achieve water and livelihood security.

AB  - Surface water (SUP) and groundwater (SUB) interact inside the hydrological cycle according to geomorphologic and climatic characteristics that compose the landscape. Therefore, the impact on any of these compounds will inevitably affect the quantity and/or quality of the other. In this context, a simple method was proposed based on the general water balance equation; which incorporates the exchange flow of superficial and groundwater in the estimate of the total water availability (OHtotal) in a watershed, starting from minimum hydroclimologic and hydrogeologic data. This method was applied to the micro-basin of La Arenosa-La Margarita creek (Pereira, Colombia) and it was noticed that the input of the groundwater flow influences in the estimate of the water availability. Also, it was analyzed that these results are quite similar to the ones obtained by widely used theoretical models used in hydrology; such as the SCS, UNESCO, added tanks, Long-term hydric balance and Hydric Efficiency for the same study area. Thus, it was concluded that the proposed method is viable to be applied in micro-basins with little hydrologic and hydrogeological information.

AB  - This paper offers an analysis of 'disaster capitalism', in which fear of disaster is exploited to facilitate the entry of a capitalist project, with regard to Jakarta's flood policy. After a major flood hit the city in 2013, the Indonesian government launched a flagship megaproject, the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD), as the solution for the city's sinking problem. The plan involves closing Jakarta Bay by means of a 32-kilometre offshore sea wall and reclaiming 5100 hectares (ha) of land. Following a corruption scandal in a related reclamation project (for 17 artificial islands), the NCICD plan was evaluated for six months in 2016. Although many criticisms of the plan surfaced during the evaluation period, they were not able to bring about radical change, i.e. cancellation of the project. Informed by the concept of 'critical juncture' (an analytical approach focusing on a short period of time in which actors' decisions have a higher probability of affecting a particular outcome), we analyse the extent to which the framing of the sinking crisis by political actors can explain such a 'near-miss' critical juncture, where change is both possible and plausible but not achieved. Drawing data from newspaper discourse, interviews, and policy documents, we find that the project's proponents have eloquently framed the sinking crisis in order to ensure preference for the seawall policy, including the project concerning the 17 islands that was claimed by the critics as the capitalist part of the project. It can be concluded that the 'disaster capitalism' notion helps understand this 'near-miss' outcome.

AB  - To identify and quantitatively evaluate complex latent factors controlling groundwater level (GWL) fluctuations in a riverside alluvial aquifer influenced by barrage construction, we developed the combined use of dynamic factor analysis (DFA) and wavelet analysis (WA). Time series data of GWL, river water level and precipitation were collected for 3 years (July 2012 to June 2015) from an alluvial aquifer underneath an agricultural area of the Nakdong river basin, South Korea. Based on the wavelet coefficients of the final approximation, the GWL data was clustered into three groups (WCG1 to WCG3). Two dynamic factors (DFs) were then extracted using DFA for each group; thus, six major factors were extracted. Next, the time-frequency variability of the extracted DFs was examined using multiresolution cross correlation analysis (MRCCA) with the following steps: 1) major driving forces and their scales in GWL fluctuations were identified by comparing maximum correlation coefficients (r(max)) between DFs and the GWL time series and 2) the results were supplemented using the wavelet transformed coherence (WTC) analysis between DFs and the hydrological time series. Finally, relative contributions of six major DFs to the GWL fluctuations could be quantitatively assessed by calculating the effective dynamic efficiency (D-ef). The characteristics and relevant process of the identified six DFs are: 1) WCGIDF(4,1) as an indicative of seasonal agricultural pumping (scales = 64-128 days; r(max) = 0.68-0.89; D-ef <= 23.1%); 2) WCG1DF(4,4) representing the cycle of regional groundwater recharge (scales = 64-128 days; r(max) = 0.98-1.00; D-ef <= 11.1%); 3) WCG2DF(4,1) indicating the complex interaction between the episodes of precipitation and direct runoff (scales = 2-8 days; r(max) = 0.82-0.91; D-ef <= 353%) and seasonal GW-RW interaction (scales = 64-128 days; r(max)= 0.76-0.91; D-ef <= 14.2%); 4) WCG2DF(4,4) reflecting the complex effects of seasonal pervasive pumping and the local recharge cycle (scales = 64-128 days; r(max) = 0.86-0.94; D-ef <= 16.4%); 5) WCG3DF(4,2) as the result of temporal pumping (scales = 2-8 days; r(max)= 0.98-0.99; D-ef <= 7.7%); and 6) WCG3DF(4,4) indicating the local recharge cycle (scales = 64-128 days; r(max)= 0.76-0.91; D-ef <= 34.2 %). This study shows that major driving forces controlling GWL time series data in a complex hydrological setting can be identified and quantitatively evaluated by the combined use of DFA and WA and applying MRCCA and WTC.

AB  - This study aims to determine the safe and sustainable yields for the Sandy Complex aquifer system in Ergene River basin in northwestern Turkey. A numerical ground-water flow model was developed for the Sandy Complex aquifer, which is the most productive and the most widespread aquifer in the basin. The finite difference ground-water model was used to simulate steady and unsteady flow in the aquifer. The model was calibrated in two steps: a steady-state calibration, by using the observed ground-water levels of January 1970; then a transient calibration, by using the observed ground-water levels for the period of January 1970 and December 2000. The resulting model was used to develop ground-water pumping scenarios in order to predict the changes in the aquifer system under a set of different pumpage conditions for a planning period of 30 years between January 2001 and December 2030. A total of eight pumping scenarios were developed under transient-flow conditions for the planning period, and the results were evaluated to determine the safe and sustainable yields of the aquifer. The results, presented in the form of a trade-off curve, demonstrate that both the safe and the sustainable yield values are exceeded if pumping continues at the present rate. An appropriate suite of management policies and plans are provided that will promote the sustainable development of the aquifer system.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development has gained worldwide attention in recent years which had enhanced its implementation. However, few studies have attempted to map the global research of sustainability. This study utilizes scientometric review of global trend and structure of sustainability research in 1991-2016 using techniques such as co-author, co-word, co-citation, clusters, and geospatial analyses. A total of 2094 bibliographic records from the Web of Science database were analyzed to generate the study's research power networks and geospatial map. The findings reveal an evolution of the research field from the definition of its concepts in the Brundtland Commission report to the recent development of models and sustainability indicators. The most significant contributions in sustainability research have originated primarily from the United States, China, United Kingdom and Canada. Also, existing studies in sustainability research focus mainly on subject categories of environmental sciences, green & sustainable science technology, civil engineering, and construction & building technology. Emerging trends in sustainability research were sustainable urban development, sustainability indicators, water management, environmental assessment, public policy, etc.; while the study generated 21 co-citation clusters. This study provides its readers with an extensive understanding of the salient research themes, trends and pattern of sustainability research worldwide. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of groundwater abstraction on stream discharge and physical habitat conditions for brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a small Danish stream. Stream discharge was simulated using a lumped hydrological model (NAM) and a scenario was set up for stream discharge reference conditions. Stream physical habitat conditions (WUA) were simulated for four life stages of trout using a hydraulic habitat model (RHYHABSIM). The impact of groundwater abstraction on WUA for trout was assessed by combined simulations from the NAM model and the RHYHABSIM model. The model predicted that groundwater abstraction reduced median annual discharge by 37% and mean annual 90th percentile discharge by 82%. Summer discharge was relatively most affected by groundwater abstraction and WUA was therefore particularly affected by groundwater abstraction during summer. WUA for adult trout was mainly controlled by suitable water depths (> 40 cm) even under conditions without abstraction. On an annual basis WUA for fry and juvenile trout was most affected by abstraction. Future modelling should consider improving simulation of low discharges and preferably not use general hydrological models.

AB  - Hydrological models and environmental flow criteria (EFC) are important in water management, but there are potential complications of combining the two. This study aimed to establish and demonstrate a framework for assessing a suitable combination of EFC and hydrological modelling. For this purpose, local expert knowledge on stream ecology is first used to establish a Critical-Flow-Calendar (CFC) depicting the typical periods for different types of stream flow being most critical to the selected ecological indicator. Then EFC are quantified for the period most critical to the specific case. Finally, the EFC are used to build objective functions for calibration of the hydrological model, and the hydrological model's capability to simulate the critical stream flows are evaluated. The purpose is to tailor the hydrological model to simulate the critical stream flows and, if necessary, to select the EFC so that they can be simulated by the hydrological model. The utility of the method was tested for hydrological modelling of EFC in 49 catchments 25-763 km(2) located at the island of Zealand in Denmark. Establishment of a CFC facilitated a constructive dialogue between ecologists and hydrologists which caused the hydrological modelling to focus on the most critical flows (low flows) and the summer low flow period. Seven different methods were applied for quantification of EFC using observations from 49 stream flow gauging stations. The Danish National Water Resource Model was then applied for hydrological modelling using (a) conventional model calibration focusing on annual water balance and (b) model calibration based on objective functions that were related to the CFC and EFC. Results showed that the 20% lowest stream flows were substantially overestimated (>100%) by the conventional hydrological model, whereas the low flow calibrated model performed better only substantially overestimating the 10% lowest stream flows. The relatively high simulation error for the lowest stream flows meant that the highest EFC was most suited to be combined with a hydrological model. To our knowledge this is the first study that tests a large scale hydrological model against EFC specifically for the period where the flow criteria are critical to the ecological indicator in question. In this case it is therefore recommended that EFC should be selected so that they can be simulated by a hydrological model and the hydrological model should be tailored to simulate the relevant flows.

AB  - The Arkansas River Shiner is a threatened species that has been extirpated throughout much of its native range (Arkansas River drainage) and remaining populations are imperiled. Prior to 1978, this species was accidently introduced to the Pecos River (Rio Grande drainage) via bait bucket, and has since persisted for over 30 years. Genetic data show that the Pecos River population maintains comparable levels of diversity at mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci relative to native range populations. Hence, we examined several factors that could be responsible for high introduced genetic diversity including (a) multiple introductions from genetically distinct sources (b) introduction of individuals from a genetically diverse source followed by rapid population expansion, (c) presence of life-history traits that foster propagule diversity and wide spatio-temporal demographic and genetic mixing; and (d) introduction to a suitable habitat in the non-native range. Our findings indicate Arkansas River Shiner was likely introduced from the Canadian River and subsequently experienced rapid population expansion that mitigated loss of diversity during the founding event. Threats to native Arkansas River Shiner have increased due to ongoing drought and water resource development, thus a finding of high diversity in the Pecos River suggests conservation significance of this non-native population. Further, it identifies the Pecos River as both a refuge for native endemic fishes and of genetic diversity of introduced, yet threatened, species.

AB  - A laboratory mock-up of a surface water groundwater system with foam blocks used to replicate a groundwater material was mounted in a tidal basin in the Hydraulics Laboratory at Cardiff University, UK. River flow in the form of a channel was generated, with an oscillating weir at the lower boundary of the system producing tides or controlled water levels. The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the manner in which flow and a conservative tracer interacted between surface and sub-surface flows for simulated riverine and tidal conditions. In these controlled laboratory conditions, results obtained with respect to flows were consistent with the laws governing surface-subsurface flows. In contrast, the conservative tracer could not move through the foam for any meaningful results to be obtained, which was thought to be due to the dominance of surface tension and sorption in the foam pores.

AB  - Contamination of groundwater with nitrate poses a major health risk to millions of people around Africa. Assessing the space-time distribution of this contamination, as well as understanding the factors that explain this contamination, is important for managing sustainable drinking water at the regional scale. This study aims to assess the variables that contribute to nitrate pollution in groundwater at the African scale by statistical modelling. We compiled a literature database of nitrate concentration in groundwater (around 250 studies) and combined it with digital maps of physical attributes such as soil, geology, climate, hydrogeology, and anthropogenic data for statistical model development. The maximum, medium, and minimum observed nitrate concentrations were analysed. In total, 13 explanatory variables were screened to explain observed nitrate pollution in groundwater. For the mean nitrate concentration, four variables are retained in the statistical explanatory model: (1) depth to groundwater (shallow groundwater, typically <50 m); (2) recharge rate; (3) aquifer type; and (4) population density. The first three variables represent intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater systems to pollution, while the latter variable is a proxy for anthropogenic pollution pressure. The model explains 65 % of the variation of mean nitrate contamination in groundwater at the African scale. Using the same proxy information, we could develop a statistical model for the maximum nitrate concentrations that explains 42 % of the nitrate variation. For the maximum concentrations, other environmental attributes such as soil type, slope, rainfall, climate class, and region type improve the prediction of maximum nitrate concentrations at the African scale. As to minimal nitrate concentrations, in the absence of normal distribution assumptions of the data set, we do not develop a statistical model for these data. The data-based statistical model presented here represents an important step towards developing tools that will allow us to accurately predict nitrate distribution at the African scale and thus may support groundwater monitoring and water management that aims to protect groundwater systems. Yet they should be further refined and validated when more detailed and harmonized data become available and/or combined with more conceptual descriptions of the fate of nutrients in the hydrosystem.

AB  - Understanding the temporal-spatial characteristics of groundwater storage is critical for agricultural planning and management in the future, thereby causing more challenges in water resource management. However, the special hydrological features of the snow water equivalent, soil moisture, and total canopy water storage in the freeze-thawing agricultural area requires the innovative methods for the water resource analysis. The watershed land cover variation and the expanding pattern of the farmlands over a decade were identified using the TM-Landsat series data. Combined with the traditional measurements of the water resource, the monthly gravity field data from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) was validated and applied. The water resources distribution based on the remotely sensed data demonstrated that the forest in the watershed center had a larger amount of water storage. The inter-annual and seasonal variability of total water storage (TWS) over the agricultural area was analyzed and the higher value appeared in the thawing period of April. The correlations of the TWS stream flow, soil moisture and snow water equivalent with precipitation were all identified. The precipitation was the dominant factor for the watershed TWS and the groundwater dynamics. Under the similar precipitation condition, the lower groundwater storage in recent years was the consequence of the expanding of farmland. The watershed averaged decrease rate of groundwater level from 2003 to 2012 was 1.06 mm/year, which was much lower than the rates in other agricultural areas. The freeze-thawing process with smelt snow and rainfall in summer had more time and chance to recharge the groundwater resource and provided the sustainable water resource. This study proved that the application of GRACE was an effective method for the temporal-spatial estimation of the TWS anomalies in the freeze thawing agricultural area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a new methodology for the sustainable and optimal allocation of water for a river basin management area. The model distinguishes between short and long-term planning horizons and goals using a short-term modeling component (STM) and a long term modeling component (LTM) respectively. An STM is a linear programming problem, and optimizes a monthly allocation schedule on an annual basis in terms of maximum net economic benefit. A cost of depletion is included in the STM net benefit calculation to address the non-use value of groundwater. An LTM consists of an STM for every year of the long-term planning horizon. Each LTM is quantified using a sustainability index, with sustainability defined in terms of risk to supply and ecological, environmental, and hydrological integrity. The LTMs are optimized to determine the most sustainable net economic benefit for the management area using a genetic algorithm. The model is applied to a test case representative of a management area in Arizona in order to highlight its potential utility.

AB  - Recent scholarship evaluates how peace and conflict affect resource sustainability. The authors of this article address how enhanced Turkey-Syria cooperation could impact management of the Ceylanpinar Aquifer, which flows beneath both countries and accounts for over 10% of Turkey's transboundary groundwater discharge. Although the Euphrates-Tigris river system apportionment has been critical for bilateral relations, allocation of the Ceylanpinar Aquifer has been neglected. The authors develop a simplified conceptual model to simulate water flow in the aquifer. Taking this model as a reference point, this article explores how political changes may impact aquifer sustainability, and proposes data-integrated modelling for sustainable management.

AB  - Mountainous headwater catchments are safeguards of quality groundwater and hence require special protection against contamination by anthropogenic sources. However, methods currently handling contamination risk fail to produce reliable results in mountainous watersheds because they overlook the influence of downhill flows and contaminant transport in the validation process. To overcome this difficulty, a new model based on so-called "concentration profiles" is presented that combines the DRASTIC framework for evaluation of intrinsic vulnerability, the categorization of land uses for evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate and Processing Modflow graphical user interface for simulation of nitrate transport. This model was tested in a mountainous region of Northern Portugal. The risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate was generally classified as moderate. The risky areas are regions used for agriculture and livestock production. These activities have raised nitrate concentrations of spring water (15-25 mg.l(-1)) downstream the risky areas. The Modflow simulations linked the risky areas (contaminant sources) to actual nitrate plumes (contaminant sinks) and modeled nitrate distributions at specific groundwater travel times. Winter plumes could be simulated for the 1-year stress period, and hence are flushable in a short time span. Spring and summer plumes could only be explained by contaminant transport during 10-20 years. In these cases, even if contaminant sources were immediately neutralized, the washout of nitrate would take decades. These results may hold back the fulfillment of sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation until 2030, and hence deserve reflection by water planners and policy makers. The modeling exercise provided extra evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments. Therefore, application of this modified DRASTIC to other mountainous areas may not need to resort to Processing Modflow. The study comprises the main paper (this paper) and a MethodsX companion paper.

AB  - This paper describes the programs and processes of a new center designed to enhance interdisciplinary team effectiveness and the building of new communities of social and natural scientists undertaking socio-environmental synthesis research. The theory and organizational structure of the center is motivated by research on interdisciplinary team science from diverse social science fields. A set of core practices was developed to catalyze the formation of new teams, facilitate team development of shared conceptual frameworks and provide customized support for teams that have challenging methodological, computational, or group dynamic issues. The vast majority of the 58 teams thus far have self-reported good progress and positive team experiences and have published extensively. Most teams took advantage of one or more forms of customized support: 21% of the teams used facilitation services, 38% support for meeting design or for resolving problems that hindered team progress, and 46% of teams used advanced computational support. Throughout, we describe the most common problems teams encountered and provide perspectives on factors and practices that may best promote positive interdisciplinary outcomes on synthesis research by teams of social and natural scientists.

AB  - The intensive use of groundwater by the gold mining industry is an important sustainability concern, especially in arid and semiarid regions where groundwater is a scarce resource. Alternatives, such as water reuse, treatment and recycling, have been implemented to overcome this issue. The potential use of reclaimed wastewater in gold heap leaching, without decreasing the process efficiency, has not yet been considered. Hence, this review focuses on the physicochemical, biological, and chemical features (organic matter, microbial loads, metal ions, and anions) of reclaimed wastewater that may limit its use in gold heap leaching.

AB  - Investigating the response of groundwater levels to the extreme weather events provides essential information for sustainable planning and management of water resources. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the groundwater Level trend of the state Orissa (India) to understand the forcing mechanism of droughts in conjunction with the anthropogenic pressure using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall statistical procedure. The pre- and post-monsoon groundwater level. records of 1002 monitoring stations during the period 1994-2003 were analyzed. The results show that the drawdowns due to deficient rainfall during dry years, high temperatures, and anthropogenic pressure have not been recovered through the recharge in wet years. However, this study does not determine whether drought, high temperatures or anthropogenic effects have had largest influence on the groundwater levels decline. The cases of significant water table declines are higher in number than those expected to occur by chance. In the pre-monsoon season, 59% of the monitoring stations experienced groundwater declines as against 51% in the post-monsoon season for the study area as a whole. This could be interpreted that the fluctuation is not a part of noise, but that a signal. is being identified. Further, the trend result showed wide spatial and seasonal differences. Irrespective of seasons, the consolidated rock formation that covers 80% of the geographical area experienced significant water table decline. However, the semi-consolidated and unconsolidated formations experienced water table decline in the pre-monsoon (summer) season only. The vulnerabte sites where the groundwater-level declined significantly were identified so that recharge measures could be taken up. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater pumping is a boundary condition in groundwater models, and surface application, reuse, diversions, and water reclamation plant discharges are boundary conditions in hydrologic or hydraulic (i.e., surface) models. These processes can be simulated, however, as internal flow and solute transport components within a fully integrated groundwater-surface water model. A methodology has been developed and incorporated into the MODHMS fully integrated surface-subsurface modeling framework to enable evaluation of water distribution and application and impacts to water quality on surface and subsurface domains. This methodology allows the supply and delivery of water and associated water quality to be a part of the model solution rather than being predetermined boundary conditions to the system. Furthermore, this methodology handles temporal and spatial changes to land use and water quality and associated effects on outdoor water distribution, infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration properties that are related to surface cover or land use classifications. This new methodology was applied to a portion of the Upper Santa Clara River system and underlying groundwater basins of southern California to aid in the evaluation of a Cl(-) total maximum daily load (TMDL) study. The outcome of this modeling evaluation has led to an enhanced understanding of how Cl(-) is transported throughout the surface-subsurface model domain and improved collaboration among stakeholders. The model serves as a powerful tool with which to develop and evaluate various approaches for the Cl(-) TMDL implementation for the Upper Santa Clara River system.

AB  - Coastal aquifers are always under threat of seawater intrusion due to over-extraction of groundwater. The objective here is to assess aquifer response to variation in pumping and rainfall recharge due to projected climate change by groundwater modelling in a heavily exploited aquifer. Finite element groundwater flow modelling was carried out from March 1988 to December 2030 using FEFLOW software. Steady state calibration was done to match observed and simulated groundwater head by varying aquifer parameters within the allowable range. Transient state calibration was carried out during the period March 1988 to December 2002. The calibrated model was validated by comparing the simulated and observed groundwater head from January 2003 to December 2012. Groundwater head was predicted for a period until 2030 under eight different scenarios of changes in pumping and rainfall recharge. This prediction indicated that 10% increase of recharge and 10% decrease of pumping causes 3 m and 6 m increase in groundwater head in upper and lower aquifers, respectively, by the end of 2030. Groundwater recharge can be increased by rejuvenation of existing surface water bodies, check dams and construction of proposed check dams. Thus, increase of groundwater recharge and decrease in well field pumping is achievable to restore this heavily exploited coastal aquifer in another 20 years.

AB  - Meteorological droughts can have unexpected cascading consequences on social, economic, and environmental systems, which depend on the starting conditions of affected systems, and on natural and human drivers. In coastal areas, droughts propagate their effects to coastal aquifers, causing exacerbation of withdrawals with consequent worsening of groundwater quality and quantity. Considering the area of Lecce province (Salento peninsula, Apulia region, Southern Italy), the study outlines the non-linear cascading paths related to groundwater depletion and salinization in an urbanized coastal region depending quite entirely on groundwater resources of a coastal karst aquifer. The outline of cascading events is the outcome of a scenario building process carried out through semi-structured interviews to water management stakeholders. The cascading scenarios relate to different degrees of system resilience and describe chain effects and vulnerabilities. These scenarios can have significant outcomes in improving water management practices and increasing both local manager and end-user awareness about potential and unexpected cascading consequences related to droughts.

AB  - The estimation of regional hydraulic conductivity is essential for the sustainable development and efficient management of groundwater. This paper presents a new physical method of estimating hydraulic conductivity based on the water level fluctuation model developed by Park and Parker (Park, E., Parker, J.C., 2008. A simple model for water table fluctuations in response to precipitation. J. Hydrol. 356, 344-349). The developed procedure was validated by comparison with the hypothetical numerical model for a variety of hydraulic conductivities, aquifer inclinations, and the heterogeneities. The model was found to be highly reliable when using water level data far from the hydraulic boundaries. The results show that the monitoring data obtained over a range of relative distances of an observation location (x) to the flow domain (W), x/W > 0.2 avoided the boundary effects. A correction factor was also proposed based on the deviation analysis of the calibrated K and f/n (ratio of recharge to precipitation divided by porosity). The results from the basal inclinations and the heterogeneities cases suggest that the estimated hydraulic conductivity is representing regional property rather than the local one. To confirm the validity of the proposed procedure, it was applied to the coastal aquifer of Jeju Island, Korea. The calibrated hydraulic conductivities were consistent with the results from previous studies. These results show that the proposed method is an effective and economical means to estimate hydraulic conductivity of large supporting volumes of subsurface aquifers with the convenient use of recharge and groundwater level data.

AB  - Explicit algebraic equations are derived to determine approximate maximum pumping rates or minimum injection rates to limit sea water intrusion to a prespecified distance from the coastline. The equations are based on Strack's (1976) single-potential solution. The maximum pumping rates and minimum injection rates applied at wells with uniform spacing to control the inland movement of the fresh water-salt water interface in a coastal aquifer could be calculated from Strack's (1976) solution without the need of a numerical optimization algorithm. When wells are distributed in a simple fashion, the maximum intrusion location can be identified precisely for pumping cases and approximately for injection cases. For pumping cases, critical points are the limit of allowable salt water intrusion, whereas no such limit exists for injection cases. Once an application site is identified, a series of design curves for pumping and injection rates can be developed for arbitrary intrusion limits. When a user is interested only in the largest pumping rates associated with critical points, one design curve can yield complete information.

AB  - A series of three-dimensional numerical simulations using a multidimensional hydrodynamic dispersion numerical model was performed to analyze various saltwater extraction schemes for mitigating seawater intrusion attributed to groundwater pumping in a coastal aquifer system. A steady-state numerical simulation was performed first to obtain initial (i.e., pregroundwater pumping) steady-state conditions before groundwater pumping, and then a transient-state numerical simulation was performed to obtain intermediate (i.e., postgroundwater pumping) steady-state conditions during groundwater pumping. In the subsequent series of transient-state numerical simulations as scenario and sensitivity analyses, four different saltwater extraction factors such as the amount of saltwater extraction, the number of extraction wells, the horizontal location of extraction wells, and the vertical interval of saltwater extraction were considered to determine an optimal saltwater extraction scheme for the coastal aquifer system threatened with seawater intrusion. The numerical simulation results show that seawater intrusion may be better mitigated when saltwater is extracted at 30% (up to 50%) of the groundwater pumping rate from a single extraction well, which is located horizontally midway between the pumping well and the coastline and is screened through the whole sand aquifer.

AB  - We used multi-map analysis of remote sensing and ancillary data to identify potentially accessible sites for groundwater resources in the Kharga Basin in the Western Desert of Egypt. This basin is dominated by Cretaceous sandstone formations and extends within the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer. It is dissected by N-S and E-W trending faults, possibly acting as conduits for upward migration of groundwater. Analysis of paleo-drainage using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) generated from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data shows that the Kharga was a closed basin that might have been the site of a paleolake. Lake water recharged the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer during the wetter Holocene time. We generated the following layers for the multi-map analysis: (1) Fracture density map from the interpretation of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI), SRTM DEM, and RADARSAT data. (2) Thermal Inertia (TI) map (for moisture content imaging) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. (3) Hydraulic conductivity map from mapping lithological units using the Landsat OLI and previously published data. (4) Aquifer thickness map from previously published data. We quantitatively ranked the Kharga Basin by considering that regions of high fracture density, high TI, thicker aquifer, and high hydraulic conductivity have higher potential for groundwater accessibility. Our analysis shows that part of the southern Kharga Basin is suitable for groundwater extraction. This region is where N-S and E-W trending faults intersect, has relatively high TI and it is underlain by thick aquifer. However, the suitability of this region for groundwater use will be reduced significantly when considering the changes in land suitability and economic depth to groundwater extraction in the next 50 years.

AB  - Stormwater drainage and wastewater disposal are primary pathways through which urbanization degrades streams. These technologies and management practices change over time, reshaping the urban template and affecting the environmental challenges a city will face in the following decades to centuries. Spatial and temporal asynchrony in the implementation and replacement of these technologies and the adoption of new management approaches means that the mechanisms of the urban stream syndrome will be heterogeneous. Thus, promoting 'one size fits all' global panaceas for urban streams may be less effective than local solutions based on the unique urban templates and socioeconomic factors governing streams. Understanding the cumulative effects of spatiotemporal changes in urban templates on streams is critical to protecting and managing them because: 1) existing water infrastructure in many countries (especially high-income countries) is aging and requires replacement, 2) urbanization in rapidly developing countries requires ever more infrastructure, and 3) demand for higher levels of environmental quality is transforming technological and management approaches globally. The management and technological decisions made during the current infrastructure replacement or new construction cycle will define the future urban template and select the trajectory and character of the urban stream syndrome during the coming decades.

AB  - In the case of Bounds v. State of New Mexico, the New Mexico Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a statute that allows domestic wells to be permitted with less oversight than other water rights. The statute, known as the domestic well exemption, is common in various forms throughout the Western United States. Currently, there are an estimated 200,000 permitted domestic wells across the State of New Mexico, increasing at a rate of approximately 5,000 per year. Various scholars have argued for amendments to domestic well statutes or local regulations to make exempt well applications as rigorous as other water right applications. In consideration of local solutions, this study addresses one of few municipal ordinances and three important controversies in domestic well management: the interaction between domestic well pumping and other water uses, the longevity of groundwater sources, and the "development loophole." The City of Santa Fe's domestic well ordinance is found to indirectly address concerns related to aquifer use and conservation, however, policies restricting well uptake in threatened areas that speak to specific, measurable goals, aligned with accurate databases, may better serve municipalities and counties in New Mexico as they do in other states.

AB  - Strategies for increasing the development and use of groundwater for agriculture over much of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are urgently needed. Expansion of small-scale groundwater irrigation offers an attractive option to smallholder farmers to overcome unreliable wet-season rainfall and enhance dry-season production. This paper presents a simple, generic groundwater-balance-based methodology that uses a set of type-curves to assist with decision making on the scope for developing sustainable groundwater irrigation supplies, and to help understand how cropping choices influence the potential areal extent of irrigation. Guidance to avoid over-exploitation of the resource is also provided. The methodology is applied to 2 sites in West Africa with contrasting climatic and subsurface conditions. At both sites the analysis reveals that there is significant potential for further groundwater development for irrigation whilst allowing provisions for other sectoral uses, including basic human needs and the environment.

AB  - The abundance of groundwater resources of Sub-Saharan Africa is generally well recognized, but quantitative estimates of their potential for irrigation development are lacking. This study derives estimates using a simple and generic water balance approach and data from secondary sources for 13 countries. Even with conservative assumptions and accounting for water demands from other sectors, including the environment, a 120-fold increase (by 13.5 million hectares) in the area under groundwater irrigation is possible for the countries considered. This expansion could improve the livelihoods of approximately 40% of the present-day rural population.

AB  - Low stream flows in the Fenton River, part of a hydrogeological setting characterized by glacial stratified drift, forces the University of Connecticut to frequently reduce groundwater withdrawals during the months of June-October. The objective of this study was to investigate stream/aquifer interactions in such a hydrogeologic system in order to increase water withdrawals while minimizing adverse impacts to in-stream flow. A groundwater flow model was developed using MODFLOW to investigate the influence of well location and pumping timing on in-stream flow in the vicinity of the water supply wells. The numerical model comprised detailed geophysical data and decadal hydrologic data (2000-2009) to assess well placement, rest periods and cyclical pumping. The relocation of a water supply well up to 228 m from the river had a positive but minimal improvement to stream flows (< 2.83 L/s). When the well field was shut off for more than 45 days, stream flows returned to the no pumping condition with only slight impact at 30 days, whereas a 30 day rest period gave 4 weeks of dampened pumping influence on stream flows. A management scenario of 1 week cyclical pumping between two water supply wells following a 45 day rest period can allow for current restriction thresholds to be reduced by 28.3 L/s with minimal impact to stream flows (7.36 L/s) and would allow additional water to be pumped for all years in which there was a demand for water.

AB  - Water infiltration is a natural process of landscape. The areas with high capacity to infiltrate are especially important in landscape planning, whose protection is crucial for the continuity of water flow, maximizing the recharge of aquifers, minimizing flooding risks and reduce soil erosion. The different interpretations of the criteria for the delimitation water infiltration areas, its imprecise legal nature and the progressive incentive for sustainable water and management policies, have created the need for an integrative and ecological based methodology that suppresses this gap at the landscape planning level. The aim of this research was to create a GIS model, based on ecological principles, that contributes to the delimitation of the maximum infiltration areas. The mapping of water-related systems guarantees the inclusion and protection of the hydrological cycle in the landscape planning. The application of the model in Almada Municipality, from Lisbon Metropolitan Area, allows the integration of the maximum infiltration areas in planning, municipal management and urban design. Almada is part of the recharge area of Tagus River aquifer. With the application of the proposed model, we concluded that 54 % of the municipality has maximum infiltration areas and 38 % of those are already impervious due to construction works. Finally, we concluded that this method should be applied in an early stage of planning, at several scales, leading to the definition of potential soil uses and priority intervention measures according with its ecological suitability.

AB  - The Jordan National Water Master Plan integrates multiple efforts to address the national water shortage, but suffers problems in implementation. The systems analysis-based approach proposed here involves stakeholders in defining: study areas/issues, flow limits (based on infrastructural, sustainability and management reasons), and the optimization objective function. The approach includes using a newly developed computer optimization model to speed analysis of stakeholder proposals. The optimization model calculates multi-period water distribution and allocation strategies, minimizing unsatisfied demand or optimizing economic effect. Implementing the approach would identify opportunities for improving water supply, conveyance and demand management, and help investment planning and international negotiations. It is transferable to other countries.

AB  - Because water shortages limit development in many parts of the world, a systematic approach is needed to use water more productively. To address this need, Molden and Sakthivadivel [Water Resour. Dev. 15 (1999) 55-71] developed a water-accounting procedure for analyzing water use patterns and tradeoffs between users. Their procedure treats groundwater and surface water as a single domain. We adapted this procedure to account for groundwater and surface water components separately, and applied the adapted procedure to the Singkarak-Ombilin River basin, Indonesia, where groundwater is a significant part of the overall water balance. Since 1998, a substantial proportion of water has been withdrawn from Singkarak Lake and diverted out of the basin, resulting in significant impacts on downstream water users and the lake ecosystem. Based on 15-20 years (1980- 1999) of hydrometeorological, land use, soil, and other relevant data, a simple groundwater balance model was developed to generate the hydrogeologic information needed for the water-accounting procedure. The water-accounting procedure was then used to evaluate present and potential future water use performance in the basin. By considering groundwater and surface water components separately, a more realistic estimate of water availability was calculated than could be obtained by lumping these components together. Results show that the diversion of 37 m(3)/s from Singkarak Lake increases the amount of water that is not available for other uses. such as for irrigation, from 57-81 to 81 -95% of total water available in the basin. The new water accounting procedure also demonstrates the viability of increasing downstream water supply and water use performance during the dry months (June -September). For example, by increasing irrigation during the wet months (January-April) or tapping water from a shallow, unconfined aquifer during the dry months, while keep maintaining sustainable groundwater levels.

AB  - The protection of environmental flows, as a management objective for a regulating agency, needs to be consistent with the aquifer water balance and the degree of resource renewability. A stylized hydro-economic model is used where natural recharge, which sustains environmental flows, is considered both in the aquifer water budget and in the welfare function as ecosystem damage. Groundwater recharge and the associated natural drainage may be neglected for aquifers containing fossil water, where the groundwater is mined. However, when dealing with an aquifer that constitutes a renewable resource, for which recharge is not negligible, natural drainage should explicitly appear in the water budget. In doing so, the optimum path of net extraction rate does not necessarily converge to the recharge rate, but depends on the costs associated with ecosystem damages. The optimal paths and equilibrium values for the water volume and water extraction are analytically derived, and numerical simulations based on the Western La Mancha aquifer (southwest Spain) illustrate the theoretical results of the study.

AB  - The paper presents how to solve some practical problems of water planning in a medium/large river basin, such as: the water resources assessment and its spatial-temporal variability over the long-short term, the impact of human activities on the water cycle, due to groundwater pumping and water returns into aquifers, the river-aquifer interactions and the aquifer depletion. It is based on the use of a new monthly conceptual distributed water balance model -PATRICAL- that includes the surface water (SW), groundwater (GW) behavior and the river-aquifer interaction. The model is applied to the Jucar River Basin District (RBD) in Spain (43,000 km(2)), with more than 250 aquifers, including catchments with humid climates (Jucar RBD northern), semiarid and arid catchments (southern). The model has a small number of parameters and obtains a satisfactory performance in SW and GW behavior. It has been calibrated/validated using monthly streamflows and two additional elements not generally used in models for large river basins, GW levels and river-aquifer interactions. In the hydrological time series of the Jucar RBD headers a statistical change point in the year 1979/80 is detected. It is due to changes in precipitation patterns and represents a 40 % of reduction in streamflows in relation with the previous period. The impact of GW pumping in all aquifers is determined, the 'Mancha Oriental' aquifer produces a significant reduction in streamflows of the Jucar river -around 200-250 hm(3)/year. The GW level in the 'Villena-Benejama' aquifer -Vinalopo Valley- has declined more than 200 m in last 30 years.

AB  - The Morelia-Capula zone depends entirely on groundwater for the supply of its more than 120000 inhabitants. The groundwater extraction has caused a decrease in the piezometric level estimated at more than .15 meters in a period rye 21 yews. Because of the importance of the aquifer system of the Morelia-Capula zone it is necessary to have a complete understating of the system, therefore, this study it carried out from the perspective of the Tothian flow systems. Three parameters are used to identify the groundwater dynamics, temperature, major ions, and depth (static level). Groundwater samples mere analyzed in a total of 35 sites (29 wells and 6 springs), consisting 26 intermediate, 8 local, and 1 regional flows. The local flow system is located in the upper strata of the aquifer system and can he seen within the shallow wells and springs The intermediate flow system is located throughout the study area below the local flow ?shin where most wells are extracting water from this system. The local and intermediate flow systems are localized in the terrigenous and volcanic units: The regional flow system is only in the volcanic unit that underlies the terrigenous unit. A few wells have come in contact with this system. A depletion trend shows that in the next few years this flow system will provide water to this cone. It was found that intensive extraction and the presence of geological faults favor the mixture of flows. Most of the water supply in the zone depends. on the intermediate flow system. The static level in the zone descends 2.13 m/year. The flow direction of local and intermediate systems generally plows the topography of the zone, although there are local alterations due to the formation of depletion cones. Results indicate the need to implement strategies to avoid contaminating local flows and to reduce the water pressure derived from extraction toward the intermediate and regional systems.

AB  - Soil salinity affects plant transpiration and growth through two main pathways: the osmotic effect of salt in the soil (osmotic stress; analogous to water stress) and the toxic effect of salt within the plant (ionic stress; salt specific). However, the drastic and sudden reduction of transpiration exhibited by most species in response to an increase of salinity in the root zone is mainly associated with the osmotic phase, while ionic stress appears at a later time, causing the premature senescence of leaves and the reduction of the plant photosynthetic area. To better investigate the effects of salinity on plant-water relations, we introduce a parsimonious soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) model accounting for both salt exclusion at the root level and osmoregulation-i.e.,the adjustment of internal water potential in response to salt stress. The model is used to interpret a paradox observed in salt-tolerant species where transpiration is maximum at an intermediate value of salinity (C-Tr,C-max), and is lower in more fresh (C < C-Tr,C-max) and more saline (C > C-Tr,C-max) conditions. Such nonmonotonic transpiration-salt concentration (T-r-C) patterns can be largely explained by plant osmoregulation, while the peak of transpiration at C-Tr,C- max tends to disappear over longer time scales, when ionic stress appears and morphological adaptations become predominant. Osmoregulation emerges here as a water-saving behavior similar to the strategies that xerophytes use to cope with aridity. The maximum of transpiration at C-Tr,C- max is thus the result of a trade-off between the enhancement of salt-tolerance and optimal carbon assimilation. Plain Language Summary Soil salinization represents a major threat for the food security and sustainable development of drylands, with salt affected soils-presently covering more than 9 billion ha worldwide-expected to further increase due to climate change, land use modifications and erroneous irrigation/groundwater abstraction practices. Despite this fact, the effects of salinity on the rate at which plants transpire and grow in salt affected soils are rarely considered in ecological and ecohydrological models, and the different processes leading to salt tolerance are yet poorly understood. Here, we introduce a simple model of how salt tolerant species adapt to elevated salt concentrations in the soil, and of how such adaptations substantially lead to plant osmoregulation, as an emergent water-saving behavior similar to the strategies that aridity-tolerant species (xerophytes) use to cope with extreme water scarcity. The bottom line is that salt-tolerant plants experience salt-stress as an alternative form of water-limitation, and developed both short-and long-term adaptations accordingly. Our findings are instrumental to a better comprehension of the interplay between soil salinization, salt tolerance and efficient water use that is, in turn, the key to understand the potential of salt-tolerant crops and contrast soil salinization.

AB  - In this study, we have integrated a suite of Holocene paleoclimatic proxies with mathematical modeling in an attempt to obtain a comprehensive picture of how watersheds respond to past climate change. A three-dimensional surface-water-groundwater model was developed to assess the effects of mid-Holocene climate change on water resources within the Crow Wing Watershed, Upper Mississippi Basin in north central Minnesota. The model was first calibrated to a 50 yr historical record of average annual surface-water discharge, monthly groundwater levels, and lake-level fluctuations. The model was able to reproduce reasonably well long-term historical records (1949-1999) of water-table and lake-level fluctuations across the watershed as well as stream discharge near the watershed outlet. The calibrated model was then used to reproduce paleo-groundwater and lake levels using climate reconstructions based on pollen-transfer functions from Williams Lake just outside the watershed. Computed declines in mid-Holocene lake levels for two lakes at opposite ends of the watershed were between 6 and 18 m. Simulated streamflow near the outlet of the watershed decreased to 70% of modern average annual discharge after similar to 200 yr. The area covered by wetlands for the entire watershed was reduced by similar to 16%. The mid-Holocene hydrologic changes indicated by these model results and corroborated by several lake-core records across the Crow Wing Watershed may serve as a useful proxy of the hydrologic response to future warm, dry climatic forecasts (ca. 2050) made by some atmospheric general-circulation models for the glaciated Midwestern United States.

AB  - In order to investigate how droughts are changed by the groundwater system and to analyse the performance of groundwater during drought, 10 time series of 1000 years of recharge and groundwater discharge were generated. The 10 X 1000 years of synthetic daily data were generated using Nearest Neighbour resampling based on 37 years of observed daily meteorological data. The root zone was simulated by a non-linear water balance model and the groundwater system by a linear reservoir model. The size and thus the response time of the reservoir was characterised by a reservoir coefficient. Subsequently, the deficit and duration of the droughts were derived from the time series of recharge and groundwater discharge using the threshold level approach. An analysis of the distribution of these droughts shows that for droughts with small return periods, the deficit in the groundwater discharge is smaller than in the recharge. For droughts with large return periods, the deficit in the groundwater discharge is larger than in the recharge. The performance of groundwater systems with respect to droughts was evaluated using three classical performance indicators (reliability, resilience and vulnerability), a combination of these three indicators (Loucks' sustainability index) and three newly defined overall performance indicators. The newly defined indicators combine the severity and frequency of the droughts, instead of analysing these separately in reliability and vulnerability. The performance is estimated for the groundwater recharge and for the discharge of groundwater systems with three different values of the reservoir coefficient. Of all the performance indicators used, one of the newly introduced overall performance indicators with a strong emphasis on droughts with a high return period appeared to characterise the groundwater droughts best. This indicator shows a more or less constant performance for low and medium high reservoir coefficients and an increasing performance for higher reservoir coefficients. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Groundwater is increasingly important for meeting water demand across the United States (U.S.). Forward thinking governance and effective management are necessary for its sustainable use. In the U.S., state governments are primarily responsible for groundwater governance (i.e., making laws, policies, and regulations) and management (i.e., implementation of laws, policies, and regulations). This decentralized system results in diverse strategies and practices. We surveyed a water quality professional from each state to better understand commonalities and differences across states. These professionals identify a wide assortment of groundwater issues and concerns, including quality and quantity impairment, staffing and budget issues, private well vulnerability, and overdraft. Respondents indicate contamination problems from natural and anthropogenic sources. Most respondents report that their states have significantly changed groundwater quality policy during the past 30 years. While most states have multiple funding sources for water quality programs, program budgets have decreased in the last decade, thereby hindering effective implementation of new policies. Over half of respondents indicate that water-quality/water-level monitoring and increased groundwater pumping will require more attention over the next decade. Several respondents anticipate groundwater regulation changes in the next five years. We discuss how our findings align with current groundwater uses in the U.S.

AB  - The quantification of the renewable flux (i.e. sustainable limit) of the hydrologic system is the prerequisite for transitioning from unsustainable to sustainable water resources management. The application of the Watershed Characteristics Approach to estimate the renewable flux of the hydrologic system was demonstrated using Minnesota's (USA) Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA). The methodology quantified the relationships between landscape properties and water balance characteristics, resulting in the development of functioning hierarchical hydrogeological units with corresponding recharge rates. This renewable flux is a key quantitative characteristic for the assessment of a sustainability indicator. The key indicator of sustainable water use is the ratio of the renewable capacity of the hydrologic system to the water use by humans and the environment. By incorporating water use estimates for the TCMA relative to the calculated recharge rates, sustainability indicators for groundwater and total flux were calculated for the metropolitan area. As far back as the 1890s, declines in TCMA groundwater levels have been observed, which correspond to the unsustainable groundwater extraction estimates identified in the results of this study. The non-stationary characteristics of urban watersheds influenced by ongoing land use/land cover changes as illustrated in this paper, emphasizes the need for conservative hydrologic planning to achieve sustainable water management. This approach can also be applied to other metropolitan areas as a hydrologic tool for decision-makers to design sustainable water policy and prevent the over-extraction of the water flowing through the hydrologic system.

AB  - This paper presents a nonlinear transfer function noise model for time-series modeling of unconfined groundwater hydrographs. The motivation for its development was that existing groundwater time-series models were unable to simulate large recharge events and multiyear droughts. This was because existing methods do not partition rainfall to runoff and do not account for nonlinear soil water drainage. To account for these nonlinear processes, a vertically integrated soil moisture module was added to an existing transfer function noise model. The soil moisture module has a highly flexible structure that allowed 84 different forms to be built. Application of the time-series model requires numerical calibration of parameters for the transfer functions, noise model and, for the nonlinear models, the soil moisture module. This was undertaken using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) global calibration scheme. However, reproducible calibration to the global optima was challenging and a number of modifications were required to the transfer function noise model. In trialing the 84 nonlinear models and 2 linear models, each was applied to eleven observation bores within a paired catchment study area in Great Western, Victoria, Australia. In comparison with existing groundwater hydrograph time-series models, the proposed nonlinear time-series model performed significantly better at all observation bores during calibration and evaluation periods. Both the linear and nonlinear models were also used to quantify the impact of revegetation within the paired catchment; however, results were inconclusive, which is likely due to time-series data for the state of the revegetation being unavailable. By analyzing the application of 84 nonlinear models to each bore, an optimal structure for the soil moisture module was identified. It is unlikely, however, that this model structure would be appropriate for all climates and geologies. To encourage further investigations, open-source code for the highly flexible groundwater time-series modeling framework is available and we invite others to develop new models.

AB  - Debate about irrigation development of water resources in northern Australia has been hampered by a lack of quantitative information to enable accurate assessment of the volume of water that could potentially be regulated in the 'North' (north of the tropic of Capricorn). Too often the debate focuses solely on streamflow volumes and quantities of runoff. In this paper we present simple calculations to estimate a representative irrigation requirement and the potential exploitable yield in each of the 12 drainage divisions of Australia in order to more fully inform this on-going debate. Environmental, social, cultural and economic considerations are not examined. The results indicate that, despite northern Australia generating approximately 64% of the continent's runoff, only 45% of Australia's potentially exploitable yield is located in that portion of Australia, due to unfavourable streamflow characteristics, storage constraints and large evaporation losses. If exploitable yield and irrigation requirement were the sole factors constraining sustainable irrigation, under a full development scenario, southern Australia could hypothetically support an area of irrigation about 60% greater than that of northern Australia (based on only 36% of the country's runoff). Using 'best estimates' of rainfall and evapotranspiration projected under changes in climate resulting from a moderate emissions scenario, the percentage of Australia's exploitable yield located in northern Australia is estimated to increase from 45% to 47% by the year 2050, which equates to a 2% increase to the percentage of Australia's hypothetical area of irrigation that could be located in northern Australia. These results suggest that efforts towards achieving and developing sustainable irrigation practices in the South will remain most important in achieving Australia's long term irrigation potential. This study also highlights the need for better regional scale information on the potential to regulate streamflow in Australia, under current and future climates. Such information is essential to guide policy and planning, future Government and private investment, and to manage community expectations of Australia's water resources.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the notion of collapse of agricultural groundwater economies using the adaptive-cycle analytical framework. This framework was applied to four case studies in southern Europe and North Africa to question and discuss the dynamics of agricultural groundwater economies. In two case studies (Saiss in Morocco and Clain basin in France), the imminent physical or socio-economic collapse was a major concern for stakeholders and the early signs of collapse led to re-organization of the groundwater economy. In the other two cases (Biskra in Algeria and Almeria in Spain), collapse was either not yet a concern or had been temporarily resolved through increased efficiency and access to additional water resources. This comparative analysis shows the importance of taking the early signs of collapse into account. These signs can be either related to resource depletion or to environmental and socio-economic impacts. Beyond these four case studies, the large number of groundwater economies under threat in (semi-)arid areas should present a warning regarding their possible collapse. Collapse can have severe and irreversible consequences in some cases, but it can also mean new opportunities and changes.

AB  - A conceptual model of the transboundary Milk River Aquifer (MRA), extending across the Canada-USA border, was developed based on literature, focused fieldwork and a three-dimensional geological model. The MRA corresponds to the Virgelle Member of the Milk River Formation (Eagle Formation in Montana, USA) and it is an important groundwater resource over a large area (25,000 km(2)). The Virgelle outcrops near the international border and along the Sweet Grass Arch in Montana. The down-gradient limit of the MRA is the unconformity separating the Virgelle from the gas-bearing sandy shale of the Alderson Member. The MRA is confined above by the Pakowki/Claggett Formations aquitards and below by the Colorado Group aquitard. The MRA contains higher transmissivity areas resulting in preferential flowpaths, confirmed by natural geochemical tracers. Tritium and C-14 delineate restricted recharge areas along the outcrops on both sides of the international border. Drastic decreases in horizontal hydraulic gradients indicate that the Milk River intercepts a large proportion of groundwater flowing to the north from the recharge area. Downgradient of the Milk River, groundwater movement is slow, as shown by Cl-36 residence times exceeding 1 Ma. These slow velocities imply that groundwater discharge downgradient of the Milk River is via vertical leakage through the Colorado Group and upward along buried valleys, which act as drains and correspond to artesian areas. When confined, the MRA contains a fossil groundwater resource, not significantly renewed by modern recharge. Groundwater exploitation thus far exceeds recharge, a situation requiring properly managed MRA groundwater depletion.

AB  - Encouraging the use of more efficient irrigation technology is often viewed as an effective, politically feasible method to reduce the consumptive use of water for agricultural production. Despite its pervasive recommendation, it is not clear that increasing irrigation efficiency will lead to water conservation in practice. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of a widespread conversion from traditional center pivot irrigation systems to higher efficiency dropped-nozzle center pivot systems that has occurred in western Kansas. State and national cost-share programs subsidized the conversion. On an average, the intended reduction in groundwater use did not occur; the shift to more efficient irrigation technology has increased groundwater extraction, in part due to shifting crop patterns.

AB  - A rigorous chemical engineering mass balance/unit operations approach is applied here to bio-diesel from algae mass culture. An equivalent of 50,000,000 gallons per year (0.006002 m(3)/s) of petroleum-based Number 2 fuel oil (US, diesel for compression-ignition engines, about 0.1% of annual US consumption) from oleaginous algae is the target. Methyl algaeate and ethyl algaeate diesel can according to this analysis conceptually be produced largely in a technologically sustainable way albeit at a lower available diesel yield. About 11 square miles of algae ponds would be needed with optimistic assumptions of 50 g biomass yield per day and m(2) pond area. CO(2) to foster algae growth should be supplied from a sustainable source such as a biomass-based ethanol production. Reliance on fossil-based CO(2) from power plants or fertilizer production renders algae diesel non-sustainable in the long term. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater availability is at the core of hydrogeology as a discipline and, simultaneously, the concept is the source of ambiguity for management and policy. Aquifer yield has undergone multiple definitions resulting in a range of scientific methods to calculate and model availability reflecting the complexity of combined scientific, management, policy, and stakeholder processes. The concept of an aquifer-yield continuum provides an approach to classify groundwater yields along a spectrum, from non-use through permissive sustained, sustainable, maximum sustained, safe, permissive mining to maximum mining yields, that builds on existing literature. Additionally, the aquifer-yield continuum provides a systems view of groundwater availability to integrate physical and social aspects in assessing management options across aquifer settings. Operational yield describes the candidate solutions for operational or technical implementation of policy, often relating to a consensus yield that incorporates human dimensions through participatory or adaptive governance processes. The concepts of operational and consensus yield address both the social and the technical nature of science-based groundwater management and governance.

AB  - The National Water Act (NWA) of 1998 has been promulgated in South Africa to support the attainment of sustainable water resource use. Before the Act was promulgated, landowners were entitled to unlimited groundwater use. The Act rectified this anomaly; however, the practical application of sustainable development concepts in groundwater resource management will be complex. A multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was used to identify critical alternative courses of action and to develop a decision-making framework for sustainable groundwater management. Through applying the decision model described in this paper a number of strategies have been proposed which are aligned to the legislative requirements of the NWA.

AB  - This study evaluated the impacts of submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) on a rocky intertidal community of South Portugal, during April-November 2011. Chlorophyll-a concentration was higher at the SGD site in respect to the Reference site. Epibenthic community structure differed between sites, with an increase in Chthamalus spp. and a decrease in macroalgae coverage at the SGD site. The abundance and body size of Mytilus galloprovincialis were consistently higher at the SGD site. During mid-spring, under potentially higher SGD and less favorable conditions for coastal phytoplankton, the ecophysiological condition of M. galloprovincialis and G. umbilicalis was also higher at the SGD site. These beneficial effects on filter-feeders and herbivores probably resulted from local increases in prey availability, supported by SGD-driven nutrient inputs. Conversely, P. depressa was not favoured by SGD, probably due to a lower dependency on algae as food. The analysis of epibenthic community structure and ecophysiological condition represents a promising approach to disentangle the ecological impacts of SGD on intertidal ecosystems.

AB  - The classic Ghyben-Herzberg estimate of the depth of the freshwater-saltwater interface together with the Dupuit approximation is a useful tool for developing analytical solutions to many seawater intrusion problems. On the basis of these assumptions, Strack (1976) developed a single-potential theory to calculate critical pumping rates in a coastal pumping scenario. The sharp interface assumption and, in particular, this analytical solution are widely used to study seawater intrusion and the sustainable management of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers. The sharp interface assumption neglects mixing and implicitly assumes that salt water remains static. Consequently, this approximation overestimates the penetration of the saltwater front and underestimates the critical pumping rates that ensure a freshwater supply. We investigate the error introduced by adopting the sharp interface approximation, and we include the effects of dispersion on the formulation of Strack (1976). To this end, we perform numerical three-dimensional variable density flow simulations. We find that Strack's equations can be extended to the case of mixing zone if the density factor is multiplied by an empirically derived dispersion factor [1 - (alpha(T)/b')(1/6)], where alpha(T) is transverse dispersivity and b' is aquifer thickness. We find that this factor can be used not only to estimate the critical pumping rate but also to correct the Ghyben-Herzberg estimate of the interface depth. Its simplicity facilitates the generalization of sharp interface analytical solutions and good predictions of seawater penetration for a broad range of conditions.

AB  - In many arid and semi-arid regions agriculture is the main user of GW, causing problems with the quantity and quality of water, but there are few institutional policies and regulations governing sustainable GW exploitation. The authors suggest an integrated methodology for enabling local GW management, capable of combining the need for GW protection with socio-economic and behavioural determinants of GW use. In the proposed tool, integration is reinforced by the inclusion of multiple stakeholders, and the use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to simulate and explore these stakeholders' attitude to GW exploitation and their responses to the introduction of new protection policies. BBNs and hydrological system properties are integrated in a GIS-based decision support system - GeSAP - which can elaborate and analyse scenarios concerning the pressure on GW due to exploitation for irrigation, and the effectiveness of protection policies, taking into account the level of consensus. In addition, the GIS interface makes it possible to spatialize the information and to investigate model results. The paper presents the results of an experimental application of the GeSAP tool to support GW planning and management in the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). To evaluate the actual usability of the GeSAP tool, case study applications were performed involving the main experts in GW protection and the regional decision-makers. Results showed that GeSAP can simulate farmers' behaviour concerning the selection of water sources for irrigation, allowing evaluation of the effectiveness of a wide range of strategies which impact water demand and consumption.

AB  - This paper describes a robust methodology for determining current surface and groundwater availability and use, as well as future changes due to climate and landuse changes. It is based on the methodology developed by CSIRO to deliver on four large-scale water availability assessments conducted in the Murray-Darling Basin, Northern Australia, south-west Western Australia, and Tasmania. It will focus on the application of the technique and results from Tasmania, providing a representative example of the approach used. The genesis of this work was the explicit desire by Australian State and Commonwealth governments to use the outputs of these water availability assessments for assisting the formation of state and federal government water policy. For example, the results of the work have already been utilised as a key technical input to decision making on funding for proposed irrigation projects in Tasmania. Outputs from the other three study areas have been used to assist in developing a water resources plan for the Murray-Darling Basin, to guide infrastructure development in northern Australia, and to plan for reductions in water availability due to climate change in south-west Western Australia. The methodology assesses current water availability through the application of rainfall-runoff and river models, and recharge and groundwater models. These were calibrated to streamflow records and groundwater levels, and parameterised using estimates of current surface and groundwater extractions and use. Having derived an estimate of current water availability, the impacts of future climate change on water availability were determined through deriving projected changes in rainfall and potential evaporation from 15 IPCC AR4 global climate models. The changes in rainfall were then dynamically down-scaled using the CSIRO-CCAM model over the study area (50,000 km(2)). The future climate sequence was then derived by modifying the historical 84-year climate sequence based on these changes in rainfall and potential evaporation. This future climate sequence was then run through the rainfall-runoff, river, recharge and groundwater models to give an estimate of water availability under future climate. The impacts of landuse changes were derived by modifying the parameters and inputs/outputs of each of the models as appropriate. Results for Tasmania indicate that historical average surface water availability across the study area is 21,815 GL/year. Of this, 636 GL/year is currently extracted for use. Historical groundwater development in Tasmania has been largely unregulated and unmetered, however current extraction is estimated to be only 38 GL/year. In some intensive irrigation areas, the modelling has demonstrated that current and future groundwater extraction will reduce baseflow in connected streams. By 2030, rainfall is projected to decrease by an average of 3% over the study area. This decrease in rainfall and concurrent increase in potential evaporation leads to a decrease in runoff and, to a lesser extent recharge, leading to a reduction in surface water availability of 5% by 2030. Results from this study are being used by the Tasmanian and Australian governments to guide decisions on the development of a sustainable irrigated agriculture industry in Tasmania.

AB  - The management of groundwater resources in coastal environments within the Mediterranean basin has become of paramount importance, especially in the light of global changes. A typical example of such a hydrosystem is the Lavrio basin in Greece. This research site involves two aquifer types-granular and karstic formations-that are hydraulically interconnected. Furthermore, the proximity to the sea and the abstractions for irrigation and drinking water supply have led to the phenomenon of seawater intrusion. The present study aims at analyzing the hydraulic, hydrological, and hydrogeological conditions of the area by means of hydrochemical and isotopical data interpretation as supporting tools, which will inform and support the development of an integrated conceptual hydrogeological model of the area. Field investigations were conducted in order to collect piezometric and chemical data and use them to retrieve the quantitative and qualitative status of the local aquifer units. New interpretation of an older dataset gave an insight into how the karstic aquifer behaves in terms of hydraulics. The results have also demonstrated that there is a hydraulic connection between the different aquifers and the Mediterranean Sea, while natural recharge was quantified for both aquifer types.

AB  - Freshwater lens on small islands may easily be overexploited or polluted due to overdrafts of fresh water by pumping which causes drawdown of the water table a rise or up-coning of the saltwater interface. Present study is concerned with using a three-dimensional finite-difference numerical model to simulate the groundwater flow and transport model to predict the behavior of groundwater system in Manukan Island. The simulations were done using variable density SEAWAT-2000 for three selected pumping schemes. Hydraulic heads (groundwater level) is the highest at the center of the island and decreases in radial shape towards the coast in all the pumping schemes (PS1-PS3). The chloride concentration in the studied aquifer increased by 98.7% in the pumping well if the pumping rate is doubled by the current (PS2 to PS3). The 1.4% seawater-freshwater mixing moves further forward to inland about 1.6m when the current pumping rate was doubled whereas moves backward to sea about 1.7m if the current pumping rate is reduced by 50%. This preliminary model of Manukan island aquifer shows that an overexploitation of groundwater in Manukan Island contributes to the seawater intrusion. Adjusting the future groundwater pumping scheme and improving groundwater management strategies are necessary to protect the freshwater aquifers. The current numerical model is a reasonable representation of the aquifer in Small Island which can be used in similar small islands with similar hydrogeological conditions in elsewhere.

Journal of Coastal Research, 28(1), 202-209. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. A numerical model (SEAWAT-2000) was selected to estimate the water balance components in the low-lying area of Manukan Island. The water balance components of the current situation have shown that decreasing freshwater storage is due to irregularities in the patterns of recharge rate and overpumping. Scenarios land 2 were selected for factors that affect the water balance components in the current situation. The water balance components in Scenarios 1 and 2 have illustrated sustainable management and utilization of groundwater resources in the study area. A valuable tool to restore groundwater storage has been demonstrated in Scenario 2, which represents the impact of future El Nino events. The best artificial recharge method must be selected with consideration given to other important factors. Extra meteorological and water usage data will aid sustainable management and utilization of groundwater resources, as well as further reduction of the pumping rate. The results of this study provide a management foundation for restoration of the groundwater resources of Manukan Island. The management foundation can also be used with other small islands that have similar hydrogeological conditions for the purpose of groundwater resource protection.

AB  - Numerical models are capable of simulating various groundwater scenarios and relate it towards groundwater management. This paper focuses on numerical modeling and water balance approaches in the search for a sustainable management plan in Manukan Island. The impacts of pumping and recharge rates represented by groundwater scenarios were investigated by means of hydraulic heads, chloride concentrations and water balance components. Overpumping and inconsistency in recharge rate are the stresses shown in Scenario A. Scenario B involved with reduction pumping rate by 25% has shown an increase in groundwater levels, chloride concentration and groundwater storage. Scenario C showed the most promising finding compared with Scenarios A and B. Highest hydraulic heads, lowest chloride concentration (1,552.2 mg/L) and positive groundwater storage (254.3 m(3)/day) were obtained in Scenario C. Chloride concentration in pumping wells still exceeds World Health Organization International Standard limit in Scenario C which illustrates an additional water treatment is needed. Nevertheless, in view of a compromise groundwater management plan in study area, Scenario C is the best plan so far to protect the groundwater resources in the study area. More understanding of the artificial recharge method (percolation tank) and study site by means of modeling studies is needed. Additionally, further progress is needed in obtaining the water usage data from each part to determine the best pumping rate. A sustainable groundwater management plan is crucial to maintain the natural resources and social benefits as well as to protect the ecological balance of Manukan Island.

AB  - The impacts of climate change and human pressure in groundwater have been greatest threats facing small islands. This paper represents a case study of groundwater responses towards the climate change and human pressures in Manukan Island Malaysia. SEAWAT-2000 was used for the simulations of groundwater response in study area. Simulations of six scenarios representing climate change and human pressures showed changes in hydraulic heads and chloride concentrations. Reduction in pumping rate and an increase in recharge rate can alter the bad effects of overdrafts in Manukan Island. In general, reduction in pumping rate and an increase in recharge rate are capable to restore and protect the groundwater resources in Manukan Island. Thus, for groundwater management options in Manukan Island, scenario 2 is capable to lessen the seawater intrusion into the aquifer and sustain water resources on a long-term basis. The selection of scenario 6 is the preeminent option during wet season. The output of this study provides a foundation which can be used in other small islands of similar hydrogeological condition for the purpose of groundwater resources protection.

AB  - The grand challenge of accessing fresh water and sanitation is a global concern. The intensity of challenge depends on the geographical location as well as the level of socio-economic development of individual countries. The present paper first reviews the key water-related global trends and examines the global agenda on water issues. Next the focus is turned on Russia. Despite of being one of the water-rich countries in the world, Russia faces a number of substantial administrative and structural issues in the water sector. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a long-term strategy for the management of this infinite, but strategic resource. The present paper develops long-term scenarios and strategies for the Russian water sector towards the year 2030. The study draws upon an earlier horizon scanning activity that identified a set of global trends and uncertainties related to water sector. This horizon scanning work is extended into alternative futures for the Russian water sector by using a combination of Foresight methods including scenario analysis, data mining, and various expert methods. Scenarios developed are characterized by a set of qualitative and quantitative factors and indicators of future developments in three key domains for the water sector: (i) the sustainability of water systems; (ii) water use by households and industry; and (iii) new water products and services. Scenarios present four alternative trajectories for the water sector that may also be applied for certain countries whose water sector is comparable with the Russia. Among the scenarios developed in the study, it is concluded that the most probable ones are Problem conservation and Losses and accidents. However, there is a possibility to revert these scenarios into more desirable trajectories, which are presented in other scenarios. For instance, a variety of new clean water technologies may be widely applied to achieve the Nearly perfect future (visionary) scenario. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Any change in the components of the water balance in a coastal aquifer, whether natural or anthropogenic, can alter the freshwater-salt water equilibrium. In this sense climate change (CC) and land use and land cover (LULC) change might significantly influence the availability of groundwater resources in the future. These coastal systems demand an integrated analysis of quantity and quality issues to obtain an appropriate assessment of hydrological impacts using density-dependent flow solutions. The aim of this work is to perform an integrated analysis of future potential global change (GC) scenarios and their hydrological impacts in a coastal aquifer, the Plana Oropesa-Torreblanca aquifer. It is a Mediterranean aquifer that extends over 75 km(2) in which important historical LULC changes have been produced and are planned for the future. Future CC scenarios will be defined by using an equi-feasible and non-feasible ensemble of projections based on the results of a multi-criteria analysis of the series generated from several regional climatic models with different downscaling approaches. The hydrological impacts of these CC scenarios combined with future LULC scenarios will be assessed with a chain of models defined by a sequential coupling of rainfall-recharge models, crop irrigation requirements and irrigation return models (for the aquifer and its neighbours that feed it), and a density-dependent aquifer approach. This chain of models, calibrated using the available historical data, allow testing of the conceptual approximation of the aquifer behaviour. They are also fed with series representatives of potential global change scenarios in order to perform a sensitivity analysis regarding future scenarios of rainfall recharge, lateral flows coming from the hydraulically connected neighbouring aquifer, agricultural recharge (taking into account expected future LULC changes) and sea level rise (SLR). The proposed analysis is valuable for improving our knowledge about the aquifer, and so comprises a tool to design sustainable adaptation management strategies taking into account the uncertainty in future GC conditions and their impacts. The results show that GC scenarios produce significant increases in the variability of flow budget components and in the salinity.

AB  - Climate and land use change (global change) impacts on groundwater systems cannot be studied in isolation. Land use and land cover (LULC) changes have a great impact on the water cycle and contaminant production and transport. Groundwater flow and storage are changing in response not only to climatic changes but also to human impacts on land uses and demands, which will alter the hydrologic cycle and subsequently impact the quantity and quality of regional water systems. Predicting groundwater recharge and discharge conditions under future climate and land use changes is essential for integrated water management and adaptation. In the Mancha Oriental system (MOS), one of the largest groundwater bodies in Spain, the transformation from dry to irrigated lands during the last decades has led to a significant drop of the groundwater table, with the consequent effect on stream-aquifer interaction in the connected Jucar River. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of water quantity and water quality is essential for a proper management of the system. On the one hand, streamflow depletion is compromising the dependent ecosystems and the supply to the downstream demands, provoking a complex management issue. On the other hand, the intense use of fertilizer in agriculture is leading to locally high groundwater nitrate concentrations. In this paper we analyze the potential impacts of climate and land use change in the system by using an integrated modeling framework that consists in sequentially coupling a watershed agriculturally based hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) with a groundwater flow model developed in MODFLOW, and with a nitrate mass-transport model in MT3DMS. SWAT model outputs (mainly groundwater recharge and pumping, considering new irrigation needs under changing evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation) are used as MODFLOW inputs to simulate changes in groundwater flow and storage and impacts on stream-aquifer interaction. SWAT and MODFLOW outputs (nitrate loads from SWAT, groundwater velocity field from MODFLOW) are used as MT3DMS inputs for assessing the fate and transport of nitrate leached from the topsoil. Three climate change scenarios have been considered, corresponding to three different general circulation models (GCMs) for emission scenario A1B that covers the control period, and short-, medium-and long-term future periods. A multi-temporal analysis of LULC change was carried out, helped by the study of historical trends (from remote-sensing images) and key driving forces to explain LULC transitions. Markov chains and European scenarios and projections were used to quantify trends in the future. The cellular automata technique was applied for stochastic modeling future LULC maps. Simulated values of river discharge, crop yields, groundwater levels and nitrate concentrations fit well to the observed ones. The results show the response of groundwater quantity and quality (nitrate pollution) to climate and land use changes, with decreasing groundwater recharge and an increase in nitrate concentrations. The sequential modeling chain has been proven to be a valuable assessment tool for supporting the development of sustainable management strategies.

AB  - Four examples are investigated for the optimal and sustainable extraction of groundwater from a coastal aquifer under the threat of seawater intrusion. The objectives and constraints of these management scenarios include maximizing the total volume of water pumped, maximizing the profit of selling water, minimizing the operational and water treatment costs, minimizing the salt concentration of the pumped water, and controlling the drawdown limits. The physical model is based on the density-dependent advective-dispersive solute transport model. Genetic algorithm is used as the optimization tool. The models are tested on a hypothetical confined aquifer with four pumping wells located at various depths. These solutions establish the feasibility of simulating various management scenarios under complex three-dimensional flow and transport processes in coastal aquifers for the optimal and sustainable use of groundwater.

AB  - Major ion geochemistry reveals that the hydrochemical evolutionary process of karst groundwater in the northeastern Huaibei Plain, China, consists of three sub-processes: the dissolution of dolomite, gypsum dissolution with dedolomitization, and mixing with overlying pore water. Understanding hydrochemical evolution has been an important topic in understanding the history, status, and dynamics of the groundwater flow system. The presented study found a hydrochemical boundary roughly corresponding to the thickness of overlying strata equating to 50 m depth, indicating two flow compartments participating in different hydrological cycles-a local shallow rapidly replenished compartment showing lower and more stable main ion concentrations, and a regional deep-flow compartment showing higher and sporadic concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl- and SO4 (2-), as well as high total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). In areas with aquifers with low water transmitting ability, groundwater samples show a high chloride ratio and elevated TDS values, indicating salinization of groundwater due to stagnant water flows. Analyses of the data on the saturation indexes and mineral solutions, in tandem with trilinear diagram analysis and petrological observations, indicate that dedolomitization is the dominant process controlling the chemical characteristics of karst groundwater in the study area. Groundwater and pore-water mixing was also observed at the later evolutionary stage of groundwater flow, demonstrating frequent groundwater/pore-water interactions where groundwater is recharged by pore water due to lower groundwater level in the study area.

AB  - Groundwater overdraft has caused fast water level decline in the North China Plain (NCP) since the 1980s. Although many hydrological models have been developed for the NCP in the past few decades, most of them deal only with the groundwater component or only at local scales. In the present study, a coupled surface water-groundwater model using the MIKE SHE code has been developed for the entire alluvial plain of the NCP. All the major processes in the land phase of the hydrological cycle are considered in the integrated modeling approach. The most important parameters of the model are first identified by a sensitivity analysis process and then calibrated for the period 2000-2005. The calibrated model is validated for the period 2006-2008 against daily observations of groundwater heads. The simulation results compare well with the observations where acceptable values of root mean square error (RMSE) (most values lie below 4 m) and correlation coefficient (R) (0.36-0.97) are obtained. The simulated evapotranspiration (ET) is then compared with the remote sensing (RS)-based ET data to further validate the model simulation. The comparison result with a R-2 value of 0.93 between the monthly averaged values of simulated actual evapotranspiration (AET) and RS AET for the entire NCP shows a good performance of the model. The water balance results indicate that more than 70% of water leaving the flow system is attributed to the ET component, of which about 0.25% is taken from the saturated zone (SZ); about 29% comes from pumping, including irrigation pumping and non-irrigation pumping (net pumping). Sustainable water management analysis of the NCP is conducted using the simulation results obtained from the integrated model. An effective approach to improve water use efficiency in the NCP is by reducing the actual ET, e. g. by introducing water-saving technologies and changes in cropping.

AB  - The rhamnose-GlcNAc disaccharide is a critical linker which connects arabinogalactan to peptidoglycan via a phosphodiester linkage. The biosynthesis of dTDP-rhamnose is catalysed by four enzymes, and the first reaction is catalysed by an rmlA gene encoding D-glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (RmlA). We generated a Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155 mutant lacking the rmlA gene via a homologous recombination method. We tested the requirement for the rmlA gene and the effect of a lack of RmlA on bacterial cell morphology. The results demonstrate that the rmlA gene is essential for mycobacterial growth and that lack of RmlA activity has profound negative effects on bacterial cell morphology. RmlA is thus a potential target for the development of new antituberculosis drugs.

AB  - Globally, the demand for water is continuously increasing, placing many regions under the burden of water stress thus leading to transboundary water conflicts and overexploitation of existing water resources. Managing water resources in many of these water-stressed regions are hampered by the lack of long-term spatio-temporal observations of surface and groundwater resources and an inadequate understanding of changes associated with increased groundwater pumping. In this study, observational data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment are combined with data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System land surface models to assess regional changes in water storage over time in the water-stressed Levant region of the Middle East. Results show that the Levant has been witnessing an overall drop in its total water storage at a rate of 10.64 +/- 0.48 mm/year, equivalent to the loss of 80% of the volume of Lake Tiberias-the largest natural freshwater body in the region. More than 90% of the water losses were attributed to overexploitation of groundwater resources, with annual groundwater losses estimated to exceed 40% of the consumed groundwater. Time series analysis of changes in total water storage supports a temporally constant loss rate rather than an abrupt change to the system instigated by the onset of the 2007 regional drought, which severely affected the wider Middle East region. An assessment of current and projected non-conventional water supply projects in the region show that their capacities will be limited to less than 40% of the model estimated annual drop in groundwater storage. These findings highlight the importance of increasing water use efficiency, particularly in the agricultural sector in an effort to reverse the groundwater storage losses.

AB  - Inadequate water management stresses water resources, impacting not only economic but also social and environmental sectors. Its consequences negatively impact the gross domestic product of affected countries by limiting economic growth. Arid coastal regions are the most severely affected due to the confluence of periods of greater demand and periods of greater scarcity. In such regions, the most reliable sources of fresh water are coastal aquifers (CAs); however, due to their current overexploitation, CAs are encountering problems such as marine intrusion (MI). In Mexico, the Costa de Hermosillo aquifer (CHA) is one of the most exploited, and at present it is experiencing the negative consequences of MI, which are harming not only quality of life of the inhabitants but also irreparably damaging the regional environment. This article aims to formulate a coastal aquifer management plan through a case study that takes environmental costs into consideration to support decision-making processes and seeks to show how sustainability strategies can be applied to recover, conserve, and sustainably exploit CAs water resources. The originality/value of this paper is the interaction of the sustainability pillars that allowed an environmental accounting evaluation as a step toward the implementation of future holistic strategies to facilitate water resource management in a sustainable development framework.

AB  - Natural groundwater recharge is inherently difficult to quantify and predict, largely because it comprises a series of processes that are spatially distributed and temporally variable. Infiltration ponds used for managed aquifer recharge (MAR) provide an opportunity to quantify recharge processes across multiple scales under semi-controlled conditions. We instrumented a 3-ha MAR infiltration pond to measure and compare infiltration patterns determined using whole-pond and point-specific methods. Whole-pond infiltration was determined by closing a transient water budget (accounting for inputs, outputs, and changes in storage), whereas point-specific infiltration rates were determined using heat as a tracer and time series analysis at eight locations in the base of the pond. Whole-pond infiltration, normalized for wetted area, rose rapidly to more than 1.0 m/d at the start of MAR operations (increasing as pond stage rose), was sustained at high rates for the next 40 d, and then decreased to less than 0.1 m/d by the end of the recharge season. Point-specific infiltration rates indicated high spatial and temporal variability, with the mean of measured values generally being lower than rates indicated by whole-pond calculations. Colocated measurements of head gradients within saturated soils below the pond were combined with infiltration rates to calculate soil hydraulic conductivity. Observations indicate a brief period of increasing saturated hydraulic conductivity, followed by a decrease of one to two orders of magnitude during the next 50 to 75 d. Locations indicating the most rapid infiltration shifted laterally during MAR operation, and we suggest that infiltration may function as a variable source area processes, conceptually similar to catchment runoff.

AB  - The study analyzes drought using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Mann-Kendall (MK) Trend Test in the context of the impacts of drought on groundwater table (GWT) during the period 1971-2011 in the Barind area, Bangladesh. The area experienced twelve moderate to extreme agricultural droughts in the years 1972, 1975, 1979, 1982, 1986, 1989, 1992, 1994, 2003, 2005, 2009 and 2010. Some of them coincide with El Nio events. Hydrological drought also occurred almost in the same years. However, relationship between all drought events and El Nio is not clear. Southern and central parts of the area frequently suffer from hydrological drought, northern part is affected by agricultural drought. Trends in SPI values indicate that the area has an insignificant trend towards drought, and numbers of mild and moderate drought are increasing. GWT depth shows strong correlation with rainy season SPI values such that GWT regaining corresponds with rising SPI values and vice versa. However, 2000 onwards, GWT depth is continuously increasing even with positive SPI values. This is due to over-exploitation of groundwater and changes in cropping patterns. Agricultural practice in Barind area based on groundwater irrigation is vulnerable to drought. Hence, adaptation measures to minimize effects of drought on groundwater ought to be taken.

AB  - In Bangladesh, agriculture plays a major role in the national economy. In the drought prone Barind area in NW Bangladesh, cropping intensity has increased almost double since late eighties of last century (from 1985) because of the introduction of groundwater irrigation. Long-term behavior of groundwater table (GWT) in the drought prone Barind area has been studied using MAKESENS model in the wake of massive installation of tube-wells. The study reveals that the maximum and minimum depths to GWT during 1991-2010 show on average declining trend of 4.51 m and 4.73 m. The long-term prediction for the period of 2020-50 assuming the current rate of groundwater withdrawal is that the declining trend will be 1.16 to 1.59 and 1.07 to 1.82 times more for maximum and minimum groundwater depths respectively in comparison to the present. The rigorous exploitation of groundwater for irrigation, decreasing rainfall and surface geological attributes lead towards declining trend of GWT. This will hamper the country's food security and ultimately threaten its socio-economic sustainability. So the appropriate strategies for the management of groundwater resource on a sustainable basis should be the priority for maintaining agricultural productivity.

AB  - Reservoirs created by impounding sediment-laden streams infill over time, reducing storage capacity and altering water quality. Increasing freshwater demand on a limited supply is adding pressure on reservoir water storage and management across much of the western and central U.S. Determining sedimentation rates is helpful to ensure a reliable and sustainable clean water supply for drinking, irrigation and recreation purposes. In the state of Kansas, located in the central Great Plains, bathymetric surveys have been completed recently for many major state and federally constructed reservoirs. In this paper, we examine sediment infill rate and storage capacity loss for all 24 federally operated reservoirs in Kansas. As of 2016, these reservoirs have an average age of 52 years and collectively have lost approximately 17% of their original capacity, with the highest single-reservoir loss of 45%, the highest annual loss rate of 0.84%, and the highest annual sediment yield of 1688 m(3)/km(2)/year. Results from this paper provide baseline information pertinent to the development, prioritization and assessment of remediation and mitigation strategies for addressing the sediment infill problem in Kansas, with general implications for other large reservoirs across the Great Plains as well as other climatologically and ecologically similar regions around the world.

AB  - Sustainable water resources management in arid and semi-arid areas needs robust models, which allow accurate and reliable predictive modeling. This issue has motivated the researchers to develop hybrid models that offer solutions on modelling problems and accurate predictions of groundwater potential zonation. For this purpose, this research aims to investigate the capability and robustness of a novel hybrid model, namely the logistic model tree (LMT) and compares it with state-of-the-art models such as the support vector machine and C4.5 models that locate potential zones for groundwater springs. A spring location dataset consisting of 359 springs was provided by field surveys and national reports and from which three different sample data sets (S1-S3) were randomly prepared (70% for training and 30% for validation). Additionally, 16 spring-related factors were analyzed using regression logistic analysis to find which factors play a significant role in spring occurrence. Twelve significant geo-environmental and morphometric factors were identified and applied in all models. The accuracy of models was evaluated by three different threshold-dependent and -Independent methods including efficiency (E), true skill statistic (TSS), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) methods. Results showed that the LMT model had the highest accuracy performance for all three validation datasets (E-mean = 0.860, TSSmean = 0.718, AUC-ROCmean = 0.904); although a slight sensitivity to change in input data was sometimes observed for this model. Furthermore, the findings showed that relative slope position (RSP) was the most important factor followed by distance from faults and lithology.

AB  - Concerns regarding groundwater contamination with nitrate and the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources have prompted the development of a multi-layered three-dimensional (3D) geological model to characterise the aquifer geometry of the Wairau Plain, Marlborough District, New Zealand. The 3D geological model which consists of eight litho-stratigraphic units has been subsequently used to synthesise hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical data for different aquifers in an approach that aims to demonstrate how integration of water chemistry data within the physical framework of a 3D geological model can help to better understand and conceptualise groundwater systems in complex geological settings. Multivariate statistical techniques (e.g. Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis) were applied to groundwater chemistry data to identify hydrochemical facies which are characteristic of distinct evolutionary pathways and a common hydrologic history of groundwaters. Principal Component Analysis on hydrochemical data demonstrated that natural water-rock interactions, redox potential and human agricultural impact are the key controls of groundwater quality in the Wairau Plain. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis revealed distinct hydrochemical water quality groups in the Wairau Plain groundwater system. Visualisation of the results of the multivariate statistical analyses and distribution of groundwater nitrate concentrations in the context of aquifer lithology highlighted the link between groundwater chemistry and the lithology of host aquifers. The methodology followed in this study can be applied in a variety of hydrogeological settings to synthesise geological, hydrogeological and hydrochemical data and present them in a format readily understood by a wide range of stakeholders. This enables a more efficient communication of the results of scientific studies to the wider community. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the impact of the 2011 severe drought on summer evapotranspiration (ET) and energy partitioning of a managed Old World bluestem grassland in the Southern Great Plains and compared the results with those from 2010, a hydrologically wet year. Measurements of CO2, latent heat (LE), and sensible heat (H) fluxes were made using an eddy covariance flux tower. In 2010, the total precipitation received during the summer months (June-August) was 82% above the 9-year average precipitation, and in 2011, it was only 8% of the 9-year average precipitation. The amount of net radiation (R-n) available at the surface was higher in the wet year (54.3% of the incident radiation) compared with the drought year (41.1% of the incident radiation). In 2010, LE consumed the majority of available energy resulting in a high evaporative fraction (EF). In 2011, less energy was converted to LE as soil moisture remained low, which also resulted in reduced plant growth. Thus, the energy partitioning in 2011 was dominated by H. Significant differences in bulk canopy conductance (G(s)) were also observed between the two years. In both years, G(s) was linearly correlated with soil volumetric water content in the top 4cm of the soil profile. The gross primary production (GPP) was linearly correlated to ET. The water use efficiency was 2.63gCkg(-1) of water in 2010 and 0.69gCkg(-1) of water in 2011. Results from this study showed that, in semi-arid grasslands, the ET and energy balance are strongly affected by water availability. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Climate change and increase of population is expected to affect coastal groundwater systems in many parts of the world. Changes in the rainfall pattern due to climate change may also lead to uncertainties in the supply and management of the groundwater resources. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of climate change on seawater intruded coastal aquifer located north of Chennai, India by density dependent groundwater modelling and to identify suitable measures of mitigation. This aquifer system is affected by seawater intrusion since the year 1969 due to over extraction of groundwater for agriculture and drinking water supply to Chennai city. Since the climate change projections for this area is available until the year 2030, the density-dependent model was used to predict the changes in hydrological stresses on the groundwater head until this year. The impact of sea level rise on seawater intrusion was noticed up to about 5 km from the coastline. The 10% increase in rainfall recharge with an additional check dams and 1 m increase in crest level of all the existing check dams is expected to increase the groundwater head by about 3 m in the upper and 5.5 m in the lower aquifers. This will also decrease the chloride concentration by about 1000 mg/l in the upper and 700 mg/l in the lower aquifers respectively. Thus, the construction of Managed Aquifer Recharge structures along with the 10% increase of rainfall pattern due to climate change will decrease the chloride concentration and restore in this seawater intruded aquifer in future.

AB  - The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome encodes 12 alternative sigma factors, several of which regulate stress responses and are required for virulence in animal models of acute infection. In this work we investigated M. tuberculosis SigM, a member of the extracytoplasmic function subfamily of alternative sigma factors. This sigma factor is expressed at low levels in vitro and does not appear to function in stress response regulation. Instead, SigM positively regulates genes required for the synthesis of surface or secreted molecules. Among these are genes encoding two pairs of Esx secreted proteins, a multisubunit nonribosomal peptide synthetase operon, and genes encoding two members of the proline-proline-glutamate (PPE) family of proteins. Genes up regulated in a sigM mutant strain include a different PPE gene, as well as several genes involved in surface lipid synthesis. Among these are genes involved in synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), a surface lipid critical for virulence during acute infection, and the kasA-kasB operon, which is required for mycolic acid synthesis. Analysis of surface lipids showed that PDIM synthesis is increased in a sigM-disrupted strain and is undetectable in a sigM overexpression strain. These findings demonstrate that SigM positively and negatively regulates cell surface and secreted molecules that are likely to function in host-pathogen interactions.

AB  - Groundwater flow modeling has been used extensively worldwide with varying degrees of success. The ability to predict the groundwater flow is critical in planning and implementing groundwater development projects under increasing demand for fresh water resources. This paper presents the simulation of the aquifer system for planning the groundwater development of Varada basin, Karnataka, India using the Galerkin finite-element method. The government of Karnataka State, India is implementing the World Bank assisted project, "Jal Nirmal" for a sustainable development of the region, thereby ensuring a safe supply of drinking water to the northern districts of the state. Varada basin is one of the beneficiaries of the project in Haveri district. Field tests carried out in the study area indicate that the region is predominantly a confined aquifer with transmissivity and storage coefficients ranging from 5.787x10(-6) m(2)/s (0.500 m(2)/day) to 4.213x10(-3) m(2)/s (3.640x10(2) m(2)/day) and 0.011-0.001x10(-2), respectively. This study mainly emphasizes the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater potential under different developmental scenarios. The model predictions were reasonably good with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.78 to 0.91 with the root mean square error of about 0.46-0.78 during calibration and validation. The stated accuracies are based on comparisons between measured and calculated heads. The outcome of the study would be a useful input for the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater planning for the sustainable development of the region.

AB  - A significant worldwide challenge is to increase the food supply to accommodate a population growing to 9,000,000,000 in the face of climate change. Per capita water supply in Jordan is among the world's lowest. Despite this scarcity, three-quarters of Jordan's water use is consumed by irrigated agriculture, while producing low economic values from additional water used compared to urban uses. However, irrigated agriculture supports Jordan's food security, so its policymakers continue to examine measures to produce more crop per drop in irrigated agriculture, to permit scarce water to meet growing urban demands. This paper examines economically efficient measures to conserve water in irrigated agriculture to sustain growing urban water demands. Using a sample of one-third of the farms in Jordan's Mafraq Basin, an econometric model is formulated to identify factors influencing irrigation water use and economic productivity. Findings show that the price of water is the overarching factor influencing both. A low water price discourages water conservation even if other institutions promote it. A high price of water encourages conservation even in the presence of other discouraging factors. Results suggest that water-conserving policies in Jordan's irrigated agriculture can be more effectively implemented where water institutions and programs are designed to be compatible with the underlying economic scarcity of water. Results carry significant implications for the design and implementation of development programs affecting the use of water in the world's dry areas.

AB  - This paper designs a stylized model representing farming in water-scarce regions of South India to address the problem of managing depleting groundwater assets facing the threat of irreversible loss. Circumstances under which it may be optimal to forgo sustainable water use are evaluated in the context of farmers' wealth and land endowments, crop choices, and risk of groundwater loss. Several policy and management implications are derived. Additionally, it is argued here that attaining livelihood resilience will entail a transformation process involving tradeoffs between different capital assets where it may be optimal for a farmer to forego the objective of maintaining groundwater sustainability. However, mere forgoing of sustainability may not ensure resilience for all. Initial wealth and risk endowments come into play, especially in heterogeneous communities.

AB  - The continuous and large-scale abstraction of groundwater has created a groundwater depletion problem in several parts of the Punjab state including Bist Doab, the interfluve region of Beas and Satluj rivers. In the present study, a few important parameters, viz. water level, stable isotope, EC, temperature, groundwater age, that can be used to fingerprint the over-exploitation of groundwater have been examined. It has been observed that with the increase in over-exploitation, the yield of shallow aquifer is progressively getting reduced and as a result forcing the farmers to sink their wells to deeper depths. With abstraction of deeper aquifer, the storage of old groundwater at the deeper aquifer is declining and getting replaced by induced accelerated inflow of young water from the recharge zone and the overlying shallow aquifer. The signatures of the modern water have been observed in the data analyzed for isotopic, hydro-chemical facies, electrical conductivity and temperature of water from deeper aquifer. The study has identified the usefulness of these parameters for identifying groundwater over-exploitation in the region. Depleting water resource may stagnate the economic progress of the region. The paper provides suitable water resource management strategies to be adopted to improve the sustainability of water resources and economic growth in the region.

AB  - Groundwater abstraction from coastal aquifers is vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise because both may potentially impact saltwater intrusion and hence groundwater quality depending on the hydrogeological setting. In the present study the impacts of sea level rise and changes in groundwater recharge are quantified for an island located in the Western Baltic Sea. The low-lying central area of the investigated part of the island was extensively drained and reclaimed during the second half of the 19th century by a system of artificial drainage canals that significantly affects the flow dynamics of the area. The drinking water, mainly for summer cottages, is abstracted from 11 wells drilled to a depth of around 20 m into the upper 5-10 m of a confined chalk aquifer, and the total pumping is only 5-6% of the drainage pumping. Increasing chloride concentrations have been observed in several abstraction wells and in some cases the WHO drinking water standard has been exceeded. Using the modeling package MODFLOW/MT3D/SEAWAT the historical, present and future freshwater-sea water distribution is simulated. The model is calibrated against hydraulic head observations and validated against geochemical and geophysical data from new investigation wells, including borehole logs, and from an airborne transient electromagnetic survey. The impact of climate changes on saltwater intrusion is found to be sensitive to the boundary conditions of the investigated system. For the flux-controlled aquifer to the west of the drained area only changes in groundwater recharge impacts the freshwater-sea water interface whereas sea level rise does not result in increasing sea water intrusion. However, on the barrier islands to the east of the reclaimed area, below which the sea is hydraulically connected to the drainage canals, and the boundary of the flow system therefore controlled, the projected changes in sea level, groundwater recharge and stage of the drainage canals all have significant impacts on saltwater intrusion and the chloride concentrations found in abstraction wells.

AB  - Groundwater discharge constitutes a significant proportion of the total flow volume in most rivers. The exchange flux between surface and groundwater greatly impacts the surface as well as the groundwater balance with serious implications on ecosystem health especially during low flow conditions. There is a move towards conjunctive river-aquifer management with the integration of surface-groundwater exchange fluxes into surface and groundwater models to manage water as a single resource. Groundwater-Surface water (GW-SW) exchange fluxes are seldom integrated into river operation and planning models. The time lags associated with the impacts of groundwater processes on nearby rivers can greatly compromise the forecasting capacity of river models especially during low flow conditions. This paper presents a conceptual framework for integrating GW-SW exchange fluxes into the new generation river operation-planning model 'Source Integrated Modelling System'. The proposed GW-SW Link Module adopts a simple pragmatic approach for estimating the exchange fluxes between a river reach and the underlying aquifer using explicit analytical solutions. This flux becomes an inflow/outflow to that river reach and forms part of the routing and calibration processes. The exchange flux comprises four components: (1) natural exchange flux resulting from river stage fluctuations during low flow conditions, within bank and overbank fluctuations; (2) flux due to groundwater extraction; (3) flux due to changes in aquifer recharge; and (4) flux due to changes in evapotranspiration. The sum of those components during every time step dictates whether the river loses water to or gains water from the aquifer. The proposed analytical solutions were found to provide flux predictions that agree favourably with those derived from a numerical groundwater model. Recognising that the simplifying assumptions that underpin the explicit analytical solution are likely to be violated in the natural world, a suite of criteria was recommended for their use under many violating conditions related to boundary conditions, head gradients, and aquifer heterogeneity. Low flow indices were adopted to demonstrate the critical role of GW-SW exchange flux when predicting river low flows. Explicit accounting of GW-SW interactions into river operation and planning models greatly enhances their forecasting capacity during low flow conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changes in groundwater storage lead to a reduction in groundwater contribution to river flow and present as non-stationarity, especially during low-flow conditions. Conventional river models typically ignore this non-stationarity, and, hence, their predictions of declines in low flows during drought periods are likely to be compromised. The present study assesses non-stationarity and highlights its implications for river modelling. A quantile regression analysis showed non-stationarity of low flows in the Namoi catchment (Australia), with statistically significant downward trends in the 10th percentile of log-transformed baseflow (10-LTB). This highlighted the usefulness of the 10-LTB metric to identify non-stationarity and, hence, alert modellers to the importance of adopting models that explicitly account for groundwater processes when modelling such river systems.

AB  - Surface-groundwater (SW-GW) interactions constitute a critical proportion of the surface and groundwater balance especially during dry conditions. Conjunctive management of surface and groundwater requires an explicit account of the exchange flux between surface and groundwater when modelling the two systems. This paper presents a case study in the predominantly gaining Boggabri-Narrabri reach of the Namoi River located in eastern Australia. The first component of the study uses the Upper Namoi numerical groundwater model to demonstrate the importance of incorporating SW-GW interactions into river management models. The second component demonstrates the advantages of incorporating groundwater processes in the Namoi River model. Results of the numerical groundwater modelling component highlighted the contrasting groundwater dynamics close to, and away from the Namoi River where lower declines were noted in a near-field well due to water replenishment sourced from river depletion. The contribution of pumping activities to river depletion was highlighted in the results of the uncertainty analysis, which showed that the SW-GW exchange flux is the most sensitive to pumping rate during dry conditions. The uncertainty analysis also showed that after a drought period, the 95% prediction interval becomes larger than the simulated flux, which implies an increasing probability of losing river conditions. The future prospect of a gaining Boggabri-Narrabri reach turning into losing was confirmed with a hypothetical extended drought scenario during which persistent expansion of groundwater pumping was assumed. The river modelling component showed that accounting for SW-GW interactions improved the predictions of low flows, and resulted in a more realistic calibration of the Namoi River model. Incorporating SW-GW interactions into river models allows explicit representation of groundwater processes that provides a mechanism to account for the impacts of additional aquifer stresses that may be introduced beyond the calibration period of the river model. Conventional river models that neglect the effects of such future stresses suffer from the phenomenon of non-stationarity and hence have inferior low flow predictions past the calibration period of the river model. The collective knowledge acquired from the two modelling exercises conducted in this study leads to a better understanding of SW-GW interactions in the Namoi River thus leading to improved water management especially during low flow conditions.

AB  - The canal water supply, which is the only source of irrigation, in the rice-dominated cropping system of the Hirakud canal command (eastern India) is able to meet only 54 % of the irrigation demand at 90 % probability of exceedance. Hence, considering groundwater as the supplemental source of irrigation, conjunctive use management study by combined simulation-optimization modelling was undertaken in order to predict the maximum permissible groundwater pumpage from the command area. Further, optimal land and water resources allocation model was developed to determine the optimal cropping pattern for maximizing net annual return. The modelling results suggested that 2.0 and 2.3 million m(3) of groundwater can be pumped from the bottom aquifer during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons, respectively, at 90 % probability of exceedance of rainfall and canal water availability (PERC). Optimal cropping patterns and pumping strategies can lead to about 51.3-12.5 % increase in net annual return from the area at 10-90 % PERC. The sensitivity analysis of the model indicates that the variation in the market price of crops has very high influence on the optimal solution followed by the cost of cultivation and cultivable area. Finally, different future scenarios of land and water use were formulated for the command area. The adoption of optimal cropping patterns and optimal pumping strategies is strongly recommended for sustainable management of available land and water resources of the canal command under hydrological uncertainties.

AB  - The present rice-dominated cropping system in the Hirakud canal command (eastern India) is under severe threat due to imbalance between irrigation water supply and demand. The canal water supply, which is the only source of irrigation, only meets 54% of the demand at 90% probability of exceedance (PE). In order to mitigate the irrigation water deficit from canal water, groundwater is considered as a supplemental source. Quasi-three-dimensional groundwater flow simulation modelling was, therefore, carried out by using Visual MODFLOW to detect the change in hydraulic head due to transient pumping stresses. The simulation model was calibrated and validated satisfactorily. Sensitivity analysis of the model parameters shows that groundwater recharge is most sensitive followed by aquifer hydraulic conductivity at almost all the sites of the command area, whereas the model is comparatively less sensitive to specific storage and specific yield. Enhanced pumping scenarios showed that groundwater extraction can be increased up to 50 times of the existing pumping without causing any adverse effect to the aquifer but the aquifer does not permit to exploit water in order to fulfill the irrigation water demand even at 10% PE. Hence, it is imperative to develop an optimal land and water resources management plan of the command area. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In forty six wells >150 m deep, from across the arsenic-polluted area of south-central Bangladesh, groundwater composition remained unchanged between 1998 and 2011. No evidence of deteriorating water quality was found in terms of arsenic, iron, manganese, boron, barium or salinity over this period of 13 years. These deep tubewells have achieved operating lives of more than 20 years with minimal institutional support. These findings confirm that tubewells tapping the deep aquifers in the Bengal Basin provide a safe, popular, and economic, means of arsenic mitigation and are likely to do so for decades to come. Nevertheless, concerns remain about the sustainability of a resource that could serve as a source of As-safe water to mitigate As-pollution in shallower aquifers in an area where tens of millions of people are exposed to dangerous levels of arsenic in well water. The conjunction of the stable composition in deep groundwater and the severe adverse health effects of arsenic in shallow groundwater lead us to challenge the notion that strong sustainability principles should be applied to the management of deep aquifer abstraction in Bangladesh is, the notion that the deep groundwater resource should be preserved for future generations by protecting it from adverse impacts, probably of a minor nature, that could occur after a long time and might not happen at all. Instead, we advocate an ethical approach to development of the deep aquifer, based on adaptive abstraction management, which allows possibly unsustainable exploitation now in order to alleviate crippling disease and death from arsenic today while also benefiting future generations by improving the health, education and economy of living children.

AB  - A replicable multidisciplinary approach is presented for science-based groundwater management practices: Bir Al-Nas (Bottom-up IntegRated Approach for sustainabLe grouNdwater mAnagement in rural areaS). This approach provides a practical example of the concept of "socio-hydrogeology", a way of incorporating the social dimension into hydrogeological investigations, as reinforced by the translation of the Arabic bir al-nas: "the people's well". To achieve this, hydrogeologists act as "social hydrologists" during their monitoring activities, which often bring them into contact with local communities and end users (and polluters) of water. Not only can they retrieve reliable information about traditional know-how and local issues, but they can also change the public perception of science/scientists to create the basis for mutual collaboration and understanding in view of implementing improved integrated groundwater management. The final outcomes are expected to be an increased awareness of communities at the local level and a clear understanding of their water issues and needs from the very early stages of the investigation. Although the importance of using such methods in groundwater analysis and management is widely recognized, hydrogeological investigations are currently dominated by sectorial approaches that are easier to implement but less sustainable. The pressure of population growth, the shift towards more water-dependent economies, climate change and its impact on water availability will require scientists to use a more integrated approach, such as Bir Al-Nas, when dealing with increasing water pollution and water-scarcity issues.

AB  - Salinization and nitrate pollution are generally ascertained as the main issues affecting coastal aquifers worldwide. In arid zones, where agricultural activities also result in soil salinization, both phenomena tend to co-exist and synergically contribute to alter groundwater quality, with severe negative impacts on human populations and natural ecosystems' wellbeing. It becomes therefore necessary to understand if and to what extent integrated hydrogeochemical tools can help in distinguishing among possible different salinization and nitrate contamination origins, in order to provide adequate science-based support to local development and environmental protection. The alluvial plain of Bou-Areg (North Morocco) extends over about 190 km(2) and is separated from the Mediterranean Sea by the coastal Lagoon of Nador. Its surface is covered for more than 60% by agricultural activities, although the region has been recently concerned by urban population increase and tourismexpansion. All these activities mainly rely on groundwater exploitation and at the same time are the main causes of both aquifer and lagoon water quality degradation. For this reason, it was chosen as a case study representative of the typical situation of coastal aquifers in arid zones worldwide, where a clear identification of salinization and pollution sources is fundamental for the implementation of locally oriented remedies and long-term management strategies. Results of a hydrogeochemical investigation performed between 2009 and 2011 show that the Bou-Areg aquifer presents high salinity (often exceeding 100 mg/L in TDS) due to both natural and anthropogenic processes. The area is also impacted by nitrate contamination, with concentrations generally exceeding the WHO statutory limits for drinking water (50 mg/L) and reaching up to about 300 mg/L, in both the rural and urban/peri-urban areas. The isotopic composition of dissolved nitrates (delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO)) was used to constrain pollution drivers. The results indicate two main origins for human-induced pollution: (i) manure and septic effluents, especially in urban areas, and (ii) synthetic fertilizers in agricultural areas. In the latter, delta N-15-enriched values highlight a mixture of those sources, possibly related to unbalanced fertilization and agricultural return flow. Boron isotopes (delta B-11) were hence studied to further distinguish the nitrate origin in the presence of multiple sources and mixing processes. The results indicate that in the study area, the high geochemical background for B and Cl, associated to the complex waterrock interaction processes, limit the application of the coupled delta B-11 and delta N-15 isotopic systematics to the detection of sources of groundwater pollution. In fact, despite the exceedingly high nitrate contents, the depleted delta B-11 values that characterize synthetic fertilizers and sewage leakages could not be detected. Therefore, even if in saline groundwater the anthropogenic contribution has a negligible effect in terms of salinity input, with both sewage and irrigation water not very charged, the associated nitrate content fuels up water-rock interaction processes, eventually leading to a mineralization increase.

AB  - Groundwater modeling is undergoing a change from traditional stand-alone studies toward being an integrated part of holistic water resources management procedures. This is illustrated by the development in Denmark, where comprehensive national databases for geologic borehole data, groundwater-related geophysical data, geologic models, as well as a national groundwater-surface water model have been established and integrated to support water management. This has enhanced the benefits of using groundwater models. Based on insight gained from this Danish experience, a scientifically realistic scenario for the use of groundwater modeling in 2020 has been developed, in which groundwater models will be a part of sophisticated databases and modeling systems. The databases and numerical models will be seamlessly integrated, and the tasks of monitoring and modeling will be merged. Numerical models for atmospheric, surface water, and groundwater processes will be coupled in one integrated modeling system that can operate at a wide range of spatial scales. Furthermore, the management systems will be constructed with a focus on building credibility of model and data use among all stakeholders and on facilitating a learning process whereby data and models, as well as stakeholders' understanding of the system, are updated to currently available information. The key scientific challenges for achieving this are (1) developing new methodologies for integration of statistical and qualitative uncertainty; (2) mapping geological heterogeneity and developing scaling methodologies; (3) developing coupled model codes; and (4) developing integrated information systems, including quality assurance and uncertainty information that facilitate active stakeholder involvement and learning.

AB  - The European Hydrological System (or Systeme Hydrologique Europeen, SHE) was initiated as a collaborative venture in 1976 between the Danish Hydraulic Institute (Denmark), Institute of Hydrology (UK) and SOGREAH (France). The present paper reviews the development history of the SHE and discusses the practical and scientific difficulties encountered during the different stages of the development. Comparison is made with eight other well-known model codes with respect to development stage and code dissemination among researchers and practitioners. Finally, the scientific developments and disputes on physically-based distributed modelling are discussed and the future perspectives outlined. The SHE venture has resulted in significant contributions to hydrological science, both in terms of model codes and new scientific insight. The fundamental scientific problems related to the inability to incorporate local scale spatial heterogeneity, scaling and uncertainty that were formulated are fundamentally still unresolved. Thus, in spite of the original visions, the hydrological community has not yet witnessed a model that in a universal sense (i.e. at all scales and for all internal variables) simulates accurate results for the right reasons. Instead, much of the scientific progress achieved during the recent years has dealt with how to live with these recognized problems.

AB  - Urbanization strongly impacts aquatic ecosystems by decreasing water quality and altering water cycles. Today, much effort is put towards the restoration and conservation of urban waterbodies to enhance ecosystem service provision, leading to liveable and sustainable cities. To enable a sustainable management of waterbodies, the quantification of the temporal and spatial variability of pollution levels and biogeochemical processes is essential. Stable isotopes have widely been used to identify sources of pollution in ecosystems. For example, increased nitrogen levels in waterbodies are often accompanied with a higher nitrogen stable isotope signature (delta N-15), which can then be detected in higher trophic levels such as mussels. The main aim of this study was to assess the suitability of nitrogen stable isotopes as measured in mussels (Mytilus edulis), as an indicator able to resolve spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen pollution in an urban, tidally influenced estuary (Swan River estuary in Western Australia). Nitrogen concentrations were generally low and nitrogen stable isotope values of nitrate throughout the estuary were well within natural values of uncontaminated groundwater, organic nitrate from soils, or marine-derived sources, indicating groundwater inflow rather than pollution by human activity was responsible for differences between sites. The delta N-15 signature in mussels was very stable over time within each site which indicated that mussels can be used as time-integrated sentinel organisms in urban systems. In addition, our study shows that the nature of the relationship between delta N-15 in the mussels and the nitrate in the water can provide insights into site-specific biogeochemical transformation of nutrients. We suggest that mussels and other sentinel organisms can become a robust tool for the detection and characterization of the dynamics of a number of emerging anthropogenic pollutants of concern in urban water systems.

AB  - This study presents new data-driven, annual estimates of the division of precipitation into the recharge, quick-flow runoff, and evapotranspiration (ET) water budget components for 2000-2013 for the contiguous United States (CONUS). The algorithms used to produce these maps ensure water budget consistency over this broad spatial scale, with contributions from precipitation influx attributed to each component at 800m resolution. The quick-flow runoff estimates for the contribution to the rapidly varying portion of the hydrograph are produced using data from 1,434 gaged watersheds, and depend on precipitation, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, and surficial geology type. Evapotranspiration estimates are produced from a regression using water balance data from 679 gaged watersheds and depend on land cover, temperature, and precipitation. The quick-flow and ET estimates are combined to calculate recharge as the remainder of precipitation. The ET and recharge estimates are checked against independent field data, and the results show good agreement. Comparisons of recharge estimates with groundwater extraction data show that in 15% of the country, groundwater is being extracted at rates higher than the local recharge. These maps of the internally consistent water budget components of recharge, quick-flow runoff, and ET, being derived from and tested against data, are expected to provide reliable first-order estimates of these quantities across the CONUS, even where field measurements are sparse.

AB  - Considerable financial, human and administrative reserves of the European Community are currently concentrated on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This implementation is hoped to positively change the approach to groundwater management in many countries; however, it probably does not have any significant impact on the issue of groundwater management optimization at the operational level. Taking into account the WFD requirements concerning the optimization of groundwater management, a methodology of groundwater resources reporting and balancing in catchment systems is proposed here. The entire discussion presented in this paper focuses on quantitative aspects of groundwater management.

AB  - Urban areas (especially cities) are challenged in meeting their direct water needs from local sources. They also exert strain on global water resources through their indirect (virtual) water use. Agencies concerned with urban water management have visions and goals for managing direct water use, but indirect use is only inferred in more global visions for sustainable consumption. There is limited quantification of "urban water performance" at the macro urban scale (whole of city) to monitor progress toward these goals. It is constrained by a lack of clarity about the evaluation approaches that best serve them. We ask, How can the evaluation approaches described in literature advance urban water management goals? We reviewed the utility of eight evaluation approaches, including urban water system modeling, urban metabolism (territorial and mass balance), consumption (life cycle assessment, water footprinting, and input-output analysis), and complex systems (ecological network analysis and systems dynamics) approaches. We found that urban metabolism based on water mass balance is a core method for generating information to inform current goals for direct urban water use, with potential for being "coupled" with the other approaches. Consumption approaches inform the management of indirect water use. We describe this in a framework for urban water evaluation to give greater clarity to this field and flag the further research that would be needed to progress this. It includes the recommendation to differentiate the evaluation of direct and indirect urban water, but to also interpret them together.

AB  - The safe groundwater yield plays a major role in the appropriate management of groundwater systems, particularly in (semi-)arid areas like Iran. This study incorporates both the water balance equation and the water table fluctuation to estimate the annual safe yield of the unconfined aquifer in the eastern part of the Kaftar Lake, an Iranian semiarid region. Firstly, the water balance year 2002-03, owing same water table elevation at the beginning and year-end, was chosen from the monthly representative groundwater hydrograph of the aquifer to be taken into account as a basic water year for determining the safe yield. Then the ratio of the total groundwater pumping to the annual groundwater recharge in the selected water balance year together with the quantity of total recharge occurred in the wet period (October to May) of the year of interest were applied to evaluate the annual safe yield at the initiation of the dry period (June to September) of the year of interest. Knowing the annual safe groundwater withdrawal rate at the initiation of each dry period could be helpful to decision makers in managing groundwater resources conservation. Analysis results indicate that to develop a safe management strategy in the aquifer; the ratio of the annual groundwater withdrawal to the annually recharged volume should not exceed 0.69. In the water year 2003-04 where the ratio is equal to 0.52, the water table raised up (about 0.48 m) while the groundwater level significantly declined (about 1.54 m) over the water year 2007-08 where the ratio of the annual groundwater withdrawal to the annually recharged volume (i.e., 2.76) is larger than 0.69.

This journal, one of the most read Indian newspapers, contributes to make these resources more visible and promotes their conservation while justifying exploitation. We identified four types of qualifications of groundwater going with different management approaches: (a) endangered heritage whose access must be regulated, (b) limited resource that must be optimized, (c) issue of survival with access ensured and (d) a source of emancipation that must be granted. The analysis invites to consider carefully the multivalence of groundwater and the arrangements between preservation and necessary uses.

AB  - In the past decades, groundwater over-exploitation has increased the vulnerability of users, social inequalities and environmental degradation. In this context, the DIALAQ project aimed to experiment and disseminate a participatory approach intended to strengthen stakeholders' capacity to implement more sustainable agricultural and groundwater management. DIALAQ's network encompasses 8 regions in 4 countries (India, Morocco, France and the United States) including groups of farmers, administration's representatives, NGOs, elected representatives and researchers from several disciplines. A seed funding enabled cooperation between academics and non-academic partners that led to the consolidation of the network and enabled the design of the project. Firstly, a focused review of literature on participatory foresight exercises in the field of groundwater management is presented. Secondly, the challenges and pathways taken in designing the research is described. This process resulted in a common methodological and ethical framework presented in conclusion.

AB  - In the Indian water policy, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is considered as one of the best supply side water management options to face groundwater depletion. It is expected to optimize the resource as well as attain environmental sustainability and meet water demands and social justice. It is also expected to be implemented with a paradigmatic shift in water management. From policy to practices, at the local level, numerous recharge structures exist, are built or planned and reveal controversial implementation. With a socio-historical approach, our paper analyses the trajectory of MAR implementation in the Pondicherry Region (South India). Through interviews and observations, the trajectories of two local projects are scrutinized, The Tank Rehabilitation Programs in Pondicherry district and a recharge shaft in Kiliyanur. Stakeholders' strategies and values regarding MAR are analysed and how local appropriation leads to adaptation and diversion. Finally, there is no paradigmatic shift going with MAR implementation. Instead, MAR is shown as a consensual policy because it is a possible compromise between groundwater conservation, optimization of the resource, satisfaction of the users and social justice, but controversial positions and oppositions should be acknowledged within implementation. The paper discusses opposed conceptions of MAR: participatory vs. expert driven, demand vs. supply driven and traditional vs. modern.

AB  - Groundwater is a finite resource under continuous external pressures. Current unsustainable groundwater use threatens the resilience of aquifer systems and their ability to provide a long-term water source. Groundwater storage is considered to be a factor of groundwater resilience, although the extent to which resilience can be maintained has yet to be explored in depth. In this study, we assess the limit of groundwater resilience in the world's largest groundwater systems with remote sensing observations. The Total Groundwater Stress (TGS) ratio, defined as the ratio of total storage to the groundwater depletion rate, is used to explore the timescales to depletion in the world's largest aquifer systems and associated groundwater buffer capacity. We find that the current state of knowledge of large-scale groundwater storage has uncertainty ranges across orders of magnitude that severely limit the characterization of resilience in the study aquifers. Additionally, we show that groundwater availability, traditionally defined as recharge and redefined in this study as total storage, can alter the systems that are considered to be stressed versus unstressed. We find that remote sensing observations from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment can assist in providing such information at the scale of a whole aquifer. For example, we demonstrate that a groundwater depletion rate in the Northwest Sahara Aquifer System of 2.690.8 km(3)/yr would result in the aquifer being depleted to 90% of its total storage in as few as 50 years given an initial storage estimate of 70 km(3).

AB  - Groundwater is an increasingly important water supply source globally. Understanding the amount of groundwater used versus the volume available is crucial to evaluate future water availability. We present a groundwater stress assessment to quantify the relationship between groundwater use and availability in the world's 37 largest aquifer systems. We quantify stress according to a ratio of groundwater use to availability, which we call the Renewable Groundwater Stress ratio. The impact of quantifying groundwater use based on nationally reported groundwater withdrawal statistics is compared to a novel approach to quantify use based on remote sensing observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Four characteristic stress regimes are defined: Overstressed, Variable Stress, Human-dominated Stress, and Unstressed. The regimes are a function of the sign of use (positive or negative) and the sign of groundwater availability, defined as mean annual recharge. The ability to mitigate and adapt to stressed conditions, where use exceeds sustainable water availability, is a function of economic capacity and land use patterns. Therefore, we qualitatively explore the relationship between stress and anthropogenic biomes. We find that estimates of groundwater stress based on withdrawal statistics are unable to capture the range of characteristic stress regimes, especially in regions dominated by sparsely populated biome types with limited cropland. GRACE-based estimates of use and stress can holistically quantify the impact of groundwater use on stress, resulting in both greater magnitudes of stress and more variability of stress between regions.

AB  - The strategic project of economic development in the Dornogobi Province in Mongolia is dependent on water supply. Thus a comprehensive hydrogeological characterization was focused on the Upper Cretaceous multi-aquifer system north of Sainshand city. A conceptual model was developed to discover the groundwater flow pattern essential to correct the setting of the numerical model of groundwater flow created using MODFLOW to assess the natural recharge of the aquifer. The conceptualization was based on geological and hydrogeological characterization. However, the evaluation of hydrochemistry proved to be the key factor revealing the principal feature of the groundwater flow pattern, which is the presence of preferential flow zones. These zones allow for intensive transfer of relatively fresh Na(Mg,Ca)-HCO3-dominated groundwater into discharge areas, where it leaks into the Quaternary aquifer. The numerical model suggested an enormous natural recharge of 22 100 m(3)/d, originating in 64% of the preferential flow zones.

AB  - We investigate complex surface deformation within the Los Angeles and Santa Ana Coastal Basins due to groundwater withdrawal and subsequent aquifer compaction/expansion. We analyze an 18 year interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series of 881 interferograms in conjunction with global positioning system (GPS) data within the groundwater basins. The large data set required the development of a distributed time series analysis framework able to automatically decompose both the InSAR and GPS time series into short-term and long-term signals. We find that short-term, seasonal oscillations of ground elevations due to annual groundwater withdrawal and recharge are unsteady due to changes in seasonal withdrawal by major water districts. The spatial pattern of seasonal ground deformation near the center of the basin corresponds to a diffusion process with peak deformation occurring at locations with highest groundwater production. Long-term signals occur over broader areas and are ultimately caused by long-term changes in groundwater production. Comparison of the geodetic data with hydraulic head data from major water districts suggests that different regions of the groundwater system are responsible for different temporal components in the observed ground deformation. Short-term, seasonal ground deformation is caused by compaction of shallower aquifers used for the majority of groundwater production whereas long-term ground deformation is correlated with delayed compaction of deeper aquifers and potential compressible clay layers. These results demonstrate the potential for geodetic analysis to be an important tool for groundwater management to maintain sustainable pumping practices.

AB  - We have developed an in vitro transcription system, using HeLa nuclear extract, that supports not only efficient splicing of a multiexon transcript but also efficient cleavage and polyadenylation. In this system, both last-intron splicing and cleavage/polyadenylation are functionally coupled to transcription via the tether of nascent RNA that extends from the terminal exon to the transcribing polymerase downstream. Communication between the 3' splice site and the poly(A) site across the terminal exon is established within minutes of their transcription, and multiple steps leading up to 3'-end processing of this exon can be distinguished. First, the 3' splice site establishes connections to enhance 3'-end processing, while the nascent 3'-end processing apparatus makes reciprocal functional connections to enhance splicing. Then, commitment to poly(A) site cleavage itself occurs and the connections of the 3'-end processing apparatus to the transcribing polymerase are strengthened. Finally, the chemical steps in the processing of the terminal exon take place, beginning with poly(A) site cleavage, continuing with polyadenylation of the 3' end, and then finishing with splicing of the last intron.

AB  - Groundwater management policies will need to be revised in many Mediterranean countries, in light of the impact of climate change and the increasing demand for water. In this paper, we analyse stakeholder perceptions of three groundwater policy scenarios which respectively assume a strengthening of state intervention, the introduction of market regulation mechanisms, and the transfer of regulation responsibility to farmers. The method consists of organizing scenario workshops with experts, institutional representatives and farmers. It is applied in two case studies in France and Portugal. From a methodological viewpoint, the research demonstrates farmers' ability to contribute to an exploratory assessment of possible future water management scenarios. From a policy viewpoint, it clarifies expectations concerning state intervention and self-regulation by farmers. It also provides some insights regarding the acceptability of tradable groundwater permits in two European contexts. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A regional hydrogeological study was carried out in the Maritimes provinces, in one of the main aquifer systems in Canada. The study area covers a land surface of 10,500 km(2), of which 9,400 km(2) is over Carboniferous and younger rocks. The sedimentary fractured bedrock is composed of a sequence of discontinuous strata of highly variable hydraulic properties, and is overlain by a thin layer of glacial till (mostly 4 to 8 m). Depending on areas, 46 to 100% of the population relies on groundwater for water supply. Almost all residential wells are shallow (28 m on average) open holes that are cased only through the surficial sediments. This paper describes a regional hydrogeological investigation based on targeted fieldwork, the integration of a wide variety of existing multisource datasets and groundwater flow numerical modelling. The aim of this paper is to present the current state of understanding of the aquifer system in a representative area of the Maritimes Basin, along with the methodology used to characterize and analyze its distinct behaviour at the regional, local and point scales. This regional hydrogeological system contains confined and unconfined zones, and its aquifer lenticular strata extend only a few kilometers. Preferential groundwater recharge occurs where sandy tills are present. The estimated mean annual recharge rate to the bedrock aquifers ranges between 130 and 165 mm/year. Several geological formations of this Basin provide good aquifers, with hydraulic conductivity in the range of 5x10(-6) 10(-4) m/s. Based on numerical flow modelling, faults were interpreted to play a key role in the regional flow. Pumping test results revealed that the aquifers can locally be very heterogeneous and anisotropic, but behave similarly to porous media. Work performed at the local scale indicated that most water-producing fractures generally have a sub-horizontal dip along a north-east (45) strike.

AB  - Development of sustainable groundwater management in Canada requires an integrated approach, including scientific knowledge and managerial and institutional issues. The priority areas that must be considered to assure the sustainable use of groundwater include factors related to groundwater availability and use; these are based on aquifer knowledge (hydrogeological maps, water budgets), as well as social (water demands), political (water laws and regulations), economical, and environmental issues (ecosystem needs). Outside of the Permafrost Shield, groundwater is ubiquitous in most of the landmass of Canada but its distribution (quantity and quality) is orgy well known in scattered parts of the country To sustain groundwater supplies in urban and rural areas, the management of groundwater resources should be supported by strong science-based programs with scientific knowledge of groundwater availability' vulnerability and sustainability and should be incorporated with water laws and regulations. A case study of an aquifer located in the province of Quebec reveals the consequences of the use of groundwater beyond sustainable pumping rates. This case study involved detailed assessment of the aquifer and 3D numerical simulations of the current and predictive scenarios of groundwater withdrawals. A synthesis of the current knowledge of groundwater resources in the world and in Canada as well as the state-of-the-art of the groundwater sciences, future research activities and other emerging issues with respect to the environment, society and policy, complete this overview.

AB  - Study region: Canada-USA border. Study focus: Since 2005, Canada has followed international developments in transboundary groundwater issues in cooperation with its southern neighbor the United States (USA) within the Internationally Shared Aquifer Resources Management Initiative (ISARM) of UNESCO. As a result, 10 Transboundary Aquifer Systems (TAS) were identified along the border between Canada and the USA. This study is an extensive review of the current state of the 10 TAS. Documentation of scientifically-based knowledge on TAS is an important step in identifying potential issues in policies that might be adopted to address shared water-resource issues. New hydrological insights for the region: This analysis emphasizes the need for more scientific data, widespread education and training, and a more clearly defined governments' role to manage groundwater at the international level. The study reviews the current legal framework and summarises the current scientific knowledge for the TAS with respect to the hydrologic and geologic framework as well as some of the major drivers for supply and demand. It also describes the links, approach and relevance of studies on the TAS to the UN Law of Transboundary Aquifers and on how these might fit in the regional strategy for the assessment and management of the TAS. Clear communication, shared knowledge and common objectives in the management of TAS will prepare the countries for future negotiations and cooperative binational programs.

AB  - The already exploited geothermal resources in the Mura-Zala basin are planned to be further developed. In this study I investigated thermal water abstraction and its impact on both the fissured basement aquifers and the intergranular Neogene siliciclastic aquifers. Total abstraction of thermal water in northeast Slovenia summed to 3.1 million m3 in 2011, with very limited artificial recharge supplied through a single reinjection well. This exploitation has resulted in depletion of the aquifers, with decline in aquifer pressure, piezometric groundwater levels and discharge rates, as well as chemistry variation, being evident in many wells. A research monitoring network has been established in 2009 and has been taking hourly measurements in eight wells. These wells are up to 2 km deep and tap aquifers in the Upper Miocene sandy Mura Formation. Daily, seasonal and annual trends were interpreted, and the measured overall regionally declining static groundwater levels are alarming, reaching 0.53 m per year. Despite the changes in conditions in the aquifers, no change of production temperature has so far been perceived. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we investigate hydrogeological aspects of eleven geothermal aquifer types in four countries in the western Pannonian basin, and their development potential. Most thermal waters outflow with temperature below 50 degrees C, and are used for bathing, drinking, industrial water supply, space and water heating. Geothermal electricity is produced only in Austria at a small pilot plant. Low share of direct use is coupled by small number of reinjection wells. Waste thermal water is produced at 149 user sites and by 307 objects, and shows rather low thermal efficiency of exploitation. Annual production of thermal water sums to approximately 40 million m(3), and the Pannonian-Pontian clastic and the Mesozoic carbonate rocks form most productive and transboundary aquifers. The innovative approach and field investigation enabled identification of potential of inactive wells which sums to 4.7 million m(3) of thermal water per year, while the legislative potential is estimated to be approximately 58.8 million m(3) per year. Since depletion of many geothermal aquifers is already evident, such increase in production might be hydrogeologically unfeasible, at least if no improvements in utilization technology are made. In order to exploit the vast identified potentials without major investments in new production wells, we recommend optimization of exploitation and extensive implementation of reinjection wells in this transboundary region.

AB  - This paper investigates depletion rates and available thermal water resources of the transboundary Upper Pannonian loose sandstone geothermal aquifer of the Mura Formation in the Mura-Zala sedimentary basin in north-eastern Slovenia, and outlines a regional reinjection strategy to mitigate depletion. The research monitoring network of 12 geothermal wells, which is being constantly upgraded since 2009, has highlighted that the current abstraction rate of 2.4 million m(3) in 2014 is not sustainable because hydraulic state has been continuously deteriorating regionally while the chemical state is affected only locally. The average regional drawdown rate in observation wells is 0.67 m annually, while very rough average value for abstraction wells is 3.0 m per year. The cumulative historical regional drawdown is above 16 m. The available thermal water resources are addressed as the cumulative abstraction rate which reverses the observed declining trend of groundwater levels, and were numerically assessed to be similar to 1.3 million m(3) of thermal water per year. These numerical models set up in the AUTOUGH2 code also provided the quantification tool of the regional groundwater balance and confirmed the gravity-driven regional groundwater flow with prevailing conductive heat transfer mechanism. Simulations of the regional reinjection strategy outline that the cumulative reinjection rate of similar to 1.48 million m(3) of thermal water per year should be sufficient to reach good status of the aquifer if the cumulative regional abstraction rate does not change. If it does, the rate should be adjusted accordingly. The water is provided by eight users of geothermal heat and should be returned by the existing reinjection wells in Lendava and Murska Sobota and two new wells situated in the central part of the basin by 2021 the latest. These findings should enhance optimization of exploitation practice and implementation of geothermal doublets in the region as the successful example of a doublet in Lendava exemplifies that no major technological issues should occur if the system is properly designed.

AB  - Human impacts on land use and vegetation in arid basins have, in some regions, altered infiltration, recharge, and groundwater chemistry. However, some modeling approaches currently used do not account for these effects. In the Trans-Pecos region of Texas the presence of modern water, increasing groundwater NO3- concentrations, and vadose zone cores flushed of naturally accumulated solutes belie the notion that basin groundwater is unaffected by overlying land use and vegetation change. Recharge to the Trans-Pecos basins is spatially and temporally variable, and due to human impacts it has likely changed since pre-western settlement time (circa 1850s). By using the INFIL 3.0.1 model, a spatially distributed model of net infiltration, the volume and spatial distribution of net infiltration was examined for two basins, Wild Horse/Michigan Flats and Lobo/Ryan Flats, with model simulations designed to examine the effects of irrigated agriculture and human impacts on vegetation. Model results indicate that recharge to the basins is not limited to mountain-front zones and discrete features (i.e., alluvial channels), rather, irrigation return flow contributes an estimated 6.3 x 10(7) m(3) (408 mm) of net infiltration over 40 yrs and net infiltration on the basin floors could contribute between 7% and 11.5% of annual basin recharge. Model results also indicate that net infiltration may be higher under current vegetation regimes than in pre-western settlement conditions; the removal of thick dense grasslands in INFIL model simulations enhanced net infiltration by 48% or more. Results from distributed models (like INFIL) improve upon scientific understanding of the links between vegetation regime and hydrological processes; this is important for the sustainable management of arid basin aquifers in Texas and elsewhere.

AB  - Remote sensing (radar, thermal and topographic) and geophysical (Vertical Electrical Sounding and Ground Penetrating Radar) data are used to understand areas with enhanced groundwater potential in deeper aquifer settings between 22 degrees 0'-22 degrees 56'N and 30 degrees 21-31 degrees 20'E in the Tushka area of southwest Egypt. The premise is that areas with enhanced groundwater accumulations represent the best locations for agricultural development that is underway in this region and that deeper sources groundwater resources are the most sustainable. New fluvial and structural interpretations emphasize that the desert landscape was produced by fluvial action in the past. The correlation of high drainage and fault densities, coincident with gentle slope, guided sites for geophysical investigation that provides information about the aquifer depth and distribution, and the subsurface distribution of faults. Results confirm the presence of subsurface fault plains and fault zones and potential water aquifers at these locations. Surface environments further demonstrated an abundance of shrubs and cultivatable soils. The new approach therefore is a cost effective and noninvasive technique that can be applied throughout the eastern Sahara to assist in resource management decisions and support the planned agricultural expansion.

AB  - A key factor for sustainable management of groundwater systems is the accurate estimation of groundwater recharge. Hydrological models are common tools for such estimations and widely used. As such models need to be calibrated against measured values, the absence of adequate data can be problematic. We present a nested multi-response calibration approach for a semi-distributed hydrological model in the semi-arid catchment of Wadi al Arab in Jordan, with sparsely available runoff data. The basic idea of the calibration approach is to use diverse observations in a nested strategy, in which sub-parts of the model are calibrated to various observation data types in a consecutive manner. First, the available different data sources have to be screened for information content of processes, e.g. if data sources contain information on mean values, spatial or temporal variability etc. for the entire catchment or only subcatchments. In a second step, the information content has to be mapped to relevant model components, which represent these processes. Then the data source is used to calibrate the respective subset of model parameters, while the remaining model parameters remain unchanged. This mapping is repeated for other available data sources. In that study the gauged spring discharge (GSD) method, flash flood observations and data from the chloride mass balance (CMB) are used to derive plausible parameter ranges for the conceptual hydrological model J2000g. The water table fluctuation (WTF) method is used to validate the model. Results from modelling using a priori parameter values from literature as a benchmark are compared. The estimated recharge rates of the calibrated model deviate less than 10% from the estimates derived from WTF method. Larger differences are visible in the years with high uncertainties in rainfall input data. The performance of the calibrated model during validation produces better results than applying the model with only a priori parameter values. The model with a priori parameter values from literature tends to overestimate recharge rates with up to 30%, particular in the wet winter of 1991/1992. An overestimation of groundwater recharge and hence available water resources clearly endangers reliable water resource managing in water scarce region. The proposed nested multi-response approach may help to better predict water resources despite data scarcity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Both increasing aridity and population growth strongly stress freshwater resources in semi-arid areas such as Jordan. The country's second largest governorate, Irbid, with over 1 million inhabitants, is already suffering from an annual water deficit of 25 million cubic meters (MCM). The population is expected to double within the next 20 years. Even without the large number of refugees from Syria, the deficit will likely increase to more then 50 MCM per year by 2035 The Governorate's exclusive resource is groundwater, abstracted by the extensive Al Arab and Kufr Asad well fields. This study presents the first three-dimensional transient regional groundwater flow model of the entire Wadi al Arab to answer important questions regarding the dynamic quality and availability of water within the catchment. Emphasis is given to the calculation and validation of the dynamic groundwater recharge, derived from a multi-proxy approach, including (1) a hydrological model covering a 30-years dataset, (2) groundwater level measurements and (3) information about springs. The model enables evaluation of the impact of abstraction on the flow regime and the groundwater budget of the resource. Sensitivity analyses of controlling parameters indicate that intense abstraction in the southern part of the Wadi al Arab system can result in critical water-level drops of 10 m at a distance of 16 km from the production wells. Moreover, modelling results suggest that observed head fluctuations are strongly controlled by anthropogenic abstraction rather than variable recharge rates due to climate changes.

AB  - The circulation of rainwater within urban areas has not yet been described in a detailed manner, as studies on this topic often remain limited to the runoff on impervious surfaces. The need for innovative and sustainable methods of water management has incited increased research efforts on the hydrological processes at work in urban areas. A distributed hydrological model based on information supplied by current urban databanks has been developed in this aim. The components of rainwater flux (i.e. surface runoff, soil runoff, drainage flow via the sewer, and evapotranspiration) as well as information on the hydric state of the urban soil (saturation level, storage capacity) are modeled at the parcel scale, and then coupled with a detailed description of the hydrographic network. This model runs continuously and has been intended to reproduce hydrological variables over very tong time series. In order to evaluate this model, it has been applied at two different scales, on two urban catchments of various land use, where hydrological data were available. This evaluation is based on the comparison of observed and simulated flowrates and saturation levels, and details the various compartments (soil, impervious or natural areas) to the outflow. This study shows the importance of water fluxes often neglected in urban hydrology, such as the evapotranspiration or the soil infiltration into sewers. This first evaluation has highlighted the capability of mapping most of the hydrological fluxes on urban catchments, such as the capacity of soil to store water. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes the design, calibration and testing processes of a new device named Automated Laboratory Infiltrometer (ALI). It allows to determinate in laboratory, under controlled conditions the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of altered or unaltered soil samples which is a key parameter to understand the movement of water through a porous medium. The ALI combines the advantages of three different approaches: measures vertical infiltration rates in a soil column, measures the actual volumes of vertically drained water through the soil column, and finally, uses heat as a natural tracer to determinate water flux rates through the porous medium; all those parameters are used to determinate Ks. The ALI was developed using the popular Arduino microcontroller board and commercially available sensors that give the whole system a low cost. Data from the ALI are recorded in a microSD memory so they can be easily read from any spreadsheet software helping to reduce time consuming and avoiding reading errors. The performance of this device was evaluated by comparing the water flow rates determined by the three approaches for which is designed; an excellent correlation among them was observed (worst correlation: R-2 = 0.9826 and r-RSME = 0.94%).

AB  - The impact derived from the exploitation of natural resources can be quantified using statistical indicators. We analyse the groundwater level evolution of jeopardised aquifers using the Temporal Variation Index and the Piezometric Situation Index. The application of both piezometric indicators to the aquifers linked to the Fuente de Piedra playa lake (southern Spain) allows us to investigate their suitability to manage groundwater resources in order to preserve its associated ecosystems. The results obtained showed that the aquifers, a detrital aquifer enclosed within Miocene-Quaternary rocks and two carbonate aquifers formed by Jurassic units, show a dissimilar piezometric level drop. In the Miocene-Quaternary aquifer various sectors are under strong pressure and piezometric levels do not recover after rainy periods. In the Jurassic aquifers, the piezometric level drops continuously over time. In view of these results, we recommend an urgent limitation of the groundwater extraction from the carbonate aquifers. This case study proves that piezometric indicators constitute a valuable tool to managers and stakeholders for identifying sectors affected by overexploitation and, thus, help to design management strategies and public participation to preserve these types of ecosystems in the future.

AB  - Crystalline-rock aquifers generally yield limited groundwater resources. However, some highly productive aquifers may be encountered, typically near tectonic discontinuities. In this study, we used a multidisciplinary experimental field approach to investigate the hydrogeological behavior of a sub-vertical permeable fault zone identified by lineament mapping. We particularly focused our investigations on the hydrogeological interactions with neighboring reservoirs. The geometry of the permeable domains was identified from geological information and hydraulic test interpretations. The system was characterized under natural conditions and during a 9-week large-scale pumping test. We used a combination of piezometric analysis, flow logs, groundwater dating and tracer tests to describe the interactions between permeable domains and the general hydrodynamical behaviors. A clear vertical compartmentalization and a strong spatial heterogeneity of permeability are highlighted. Under ambient conditions, the vertical permeable fault zone allows discharge of deep groundwater flows within the superficial permeable domain. The estimated flow across the total length of the fault zone ranged from 170 to 200 m(3)/day. Under pumping conditions, hydrological data and groundwater dating clearly indicated a flow inversion. The fault zone appears to be highly dependent on the surrounding reservoirs which mainly ensure its recharge. Groundwater fluxes were estimated from tracer tests interpretation. This study demonstrates the hydrogeological capacities of a sub-vertical fault aquifer in a crystalline context. By describing the hydrological behavior of a fault zone, this study provides important constrain about groundwater management and protection of such resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Groundwater recharge is an important metric for sustainable water management, particularly in semi-arid regions. Hard-rock aquifers underlie two-thirds of India and appropriate techniques for estimating groundwater recharge are needed, but the accuracy of such values is highly uncertain. The chloride mass balance (CMB) method was employed to estimate annual groundwater recharge rates in a monsoon-dependent area of Jaisamand Lake basin in Rajasthan, which contains the Gangeshwar watershed. A monitoring program was established within the watershed during summer 2009, with local participation for the collection of rainfall and groundwater samples. Groundwater recharge was estimated spatially over a 3-year period with pre-monsoon and post-monsoon datasets. Recharge rates estimated using the CMB method were then compared to those estimated using the water-table fluctuation (WTF) method. Specific yield was 0.63 % and assumed to be homogenous across the watershed. The average recharge rate derived from the WTF method (31 mm/year) was higher than that derived from the CMB method (24.3 mm/year). CMB recharge rates were also applied to obtain a water balance for the watershed. CMB recharge rates were used to estimate annual groundwater replenishment and were compared with estimates of groundwater withdrawal using Landsat imagery. Over the 2009-2011 study period, groundwater demand was about seven times greater than the estimated groundwater renewal of 5.6 million cubic meters. This analysis highlights the challenges associated with estimating groundwater recharge in fractured hard-rock aquifers, and how renewable groundwater-resource estimates can be used as a metric to promote sustainable water use.

AB  - The influence of both local and global drivers on long-term changes in the vegetation of Namibia's extensive rangelands was investigated. Fifty-two historical photographs of the Palgrave Expedition of 1876 were re-photographed and used to document changes over more than 130 years, in grass, shrub and tree cover within three major biomes along a 1200 km climatic gradient in central and southern Namibia. We showed that patterns of change are correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and that below a threshold of around 250 mm, vegetation has remained remarkably stable regardless of land-use or tenure regime. Above this threshold, an increase in tree cover is linked to the rainfall gradient, the legacies of historical events in the late 19th century, subsequent transformations in land-use and increased atmospheric CO2. We discuss these findings in relation to pastoral and settler societies, paleo- and historical climatic trends and predictions of vegetation change under future global warming scenarios. We argue that changes in land-use associated with colonialism (decimation of megaherbivores and wildlife browsers; fire suppression, cattle ranching), as well as the effects of CO2 fertilisation provide the most parsimonious explanations for vegetation change. We found no evidence that aridification, as projected under future climate change scenarios, has started in the region. This study provided empirical evidence and theoretical insights into the relative importance of local and global drivers of change in the savanna environments of central and southern Namibia and global savanna ecosystems more generally.

AB  - The Vaslui river, a left hand tributary of Barlad, is located in the eastern part of Romania. The monitoring of groundwaters, within water bodies, records information in view of a long term tendency evaluation, both as a result of changes in the natural conditions and as an effect of anthropic activities. The hydrographic network of Vaslui is in deficit, in regard to surface water reserves. The groundwater reserves are richer, but that is of local importance only, as they are often salinized. The main subterranean waters are accumulated in cracks and cavities of the calcareous-sedimentary complex, as well as in the sand of the interfluvial surfaces. The water body GWPRO3, specific to the hydrographic network Vaslui, is a "qualitative risk water body" and its quantity is directly influenced by the quantity of rain. The subterranean waters register a relative flow rate stability, but the reserves are scarce, compared to the rest of the country. The GWPRO5 water body is a cross-basin and cross-border one and it is used in compliance with the European principles for the exploitation of subterranean resources. The qualitatively deteriorated phreatic aquifer consists of alluvial deposits in the waterside and terraces of Vaslui, but also at the bottom of the loess deposits within the interfluvial network. From a hydrological point of view, the Vaslui basin is of low importance. As it is geographically located in the poorest department of the EU, that area is under intense study. Therefore, the hydro-geologic studies represented a priority, in order to emphasize the water reserves. Due to their high flow rate and proper quality, the deep groundwaters are exploited and they can supply the necessary water for certain urban and rural areas.

AB  - The mountainous climate of Suha drainage basin manifests through important rainfall quantities, which despite their relatively reduced length ensure a rich and constant discharge of rivers. The study of groundwater and their quality has been conducted by analyzing three wells drilled in 1972. Observations thus sum up over 40 years, sufficient time for a correct evaluation of water resources. The three wells are located on Gemenea (F1), Suha (F2) and Negrileasa (F3) rivers. The wells depths are different (F1 - 11 m, F2 - 10.5 m and F3 - 4.25 m) and present a water table depth of 9.5 m at Fl, 8.60 m for F2 and 2.87 m in F3 section. Ostra and Stulpicani townships are alimented with groundwater from the aquifer represented by Suha and its tributaries' common floodplain. In order to analyze water quality, samples from Tamicioara and Stulpicani sections have been used. All chemical parameters (pH, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Cr, Cu, Zn, Cl etc.) do not present exceeding of the maximum admissible concentration (MAC). The aquifer represented by gravels and sands is rich and contains good quality water. Water resources present in Suha basin can sustain alimentation with drinkable and industrial water in the conditions in which mining activities at Lesu Ursului have stopped.

AB  - In the Tiber river basin (Central Italy) a conspicuous part of the water for human consumption arises from karstic springs. In this context it is fundamental for management purposes to study the relations between the evolution of the rainfall input overall the basin and the distribution in time and space of the stored resources, in relation to the present or future basin climatic conditions. However, the lack of sound and representatively long time series of outflow represents an obstacle, as very often only few information on their flow regimen is available. Hence one of the problem that the manager has to face concerns the reconstruction of reliable spring discharge time series consistent with the observed and future rainfall regimen. The final aim of this work is to determine suitable parameters for generating realistic weekly hydrographs for the main springs located in Central Italy, consistent with the observed precipitation evolution. For this goal, the available data for the outflow of 6 carbonatic springs have been analyzed for the period 1998-2010 (except one of them, whose data are available from 1930). These springs share the same hydrological annual behavior: a rising period (approximately winter and spring) characterized by a steep quasi-linear increase and a recession period characterized by a decrease of the outflow which can be approximated by an exponential function. The annual outflow parameters (maximum and minimum outflow, duration of the rising and recession) are linearly related to the standardized precipitation indices computed at basin scale and for suitable aggregation times, different for each parameter. The approximation introduced considering the basin rainfall regime, instead of the local one, appears to be negligible. The variability in time of the springs parameters has been estimated considering the regression line of the parameters themselves versus the SPI. The method has been validated comparing the observed and the simulated hydrographs. The comparison shows that the error on the annual minimum outflow, that is the most important parameter when one has to tackle management problems, is in the order of 10-15% when the own variability of the spring is taken into account and in the order of 20-25% when the mean variability computed all over the available springs is considered.

AB  - The term sustainable pumping rate (SPR) is defined as the maximum pumping rate that can be maintained indefinitely without mining an aquifer, and is different from the concept of safe yield (SY), which takes into account also aspects related to the much wider concept of sustainability. The assessment of the SPR for the case study of Petrignano d'Assisi, an alluvial aquifer located in Central Italy, shows the need for a reliable estimate of the global water budget of the aquifer, particularly of the recharge under undisturbed conditions; however, the latter is not sufficient, because the SPR is affected also by the geometry of the aquifer, the hydraulic conductivity pattern, the variation of recharge/discharge ratio induced by the abstractions, and so on. All these aspects are analyzed by means of a numerical flow model calibrated both under undisturbed conditions (1974) and under exploitation conditions (1998 to 2004). The steady-state modeling results show that the relation between recharge and abstractions both at local and global scale is a key point in order to estimate a long-term SPR. Moreover, as it could be necessary to overexploit the aquifer for short periods, e.g., during drought episodes, the estimate of SPR must be performed also in transient conditions, in order to take into account the characteristic time of depletion and the successive recovery.

AB  - Maintenance of low flows during dry periods is critical for supporting ecosystem function in many rivers. Managed aquifer recharge is one method that can be used to augment low flows in rivers that are hydraulically connected to an alluvial groundwater system. In this study, we performed numerical modeling to evaluate a managed recharge operation designed to retime streamflow in the South Platte River, northeastern Colorado (USA). Modeling involved the simulation of spatially and temporally variable groundwater-surface water exchange, as well as streamflow routing in the river. Periodic solutions that incorporate seasonality were developed for two scenarios, a natural base case scenario and an active management scenario that included groundwater pumping and managed recharge. A framework was developed to compare the scenarios by analyzing changes in head-dependent inflows and outflows to/ from the aquifer, which was used to interpret the simulated impacts on streamflow. The results clearly illustrate a retiming of streamflow. Groundwater pumping near the river during winter months causes a reduction in streamflow during those months. Delivery of the pumped water to recharge ponds, located further from the river, has the intended effect of augmenting streamflow during low-flow summer months. Higher streamflow is not limited to the target time period, however, which highlights an inefficiency of flow augmentation projects that rely on water retention in the subsurface.

AB  - Groundwater resources are steadily subjected to increasing water demands. The aquifers are considered as the most accessible source of fresh water. In recent years, they have been faced with severe water withdrawal in arid and semi-arid countries like Iran and thus some aquifers was considered as forbidden aquifers that it means the water withdrawal from these aquifers is unauthorized. Given a critical situation, groundwater resources management in the form of tools such as monitoring the level of the aquifers and developing the restoring scenarios is essential. Therefore, for this purpose, a framework has been developed based on prediction of groundwater level using Bayesian Networks (BNs) model. Furthermore, Multi Criteria Decision Making methods (MCDM) techniques proposed and employed for ranking of proposed groundwater management scenarios. This framework was evaluated for restoring the Birjand aquifer in Iran in different hydrological conditions. A probabilistic Dynamic BN was proposed for groundwater level prediction under uncertainties. After analyzing the obtained results, the applicable short term scenarios for groundwater management as well as appropriate economic, social and technical criteria were defined for decision making procedure. Then, using elicitation of decision makers' opinions on the relative importance and performance of criteria, SAW, TOPSIS and PROMETHEE-II techniques were applied to rank the scenarios and the obtained results were aggregated by Borda method for final ranking of the scenarios. Lastly, the final results demonstrates the capability of the proposed framework for groundwater resources planning and management which can be employed for reducing the risk of aquifer level declining.

They are also vulnerable to pollution and overabstraction of groundwater. Basic knowledge on hydrogeological and hydrochemical processes of freshwater lenses is important to ensure a sustainable water management, especially when taking into account possible effects of climate change. This is the first study which gives a compact overview on the age distribution, recharge conditions and hydrochemical evolution of a barrier island freshwater lens in the southern North Sea (Spiekeroog Island, Eastfrisian Wadden Sea). Two ground- and surface water sampling campaigns were carried out in May and July 2011, supplemented by monthly precipitation sampling from July to October. H-3-He-3 ages, stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and major ion concentrations show that the freshwater lens reaches a depth of 44 mbsl, where an aquitard constrains further expansion in vertical direction. Groundwater ages are increasing from 4.4 years in 12 mbsl up to >70 years at the freshwater-saltwater interface. Stable isotope signatures reflect average local precipitation signatures. An annual recharge rate of 300-400 mm was calculated with H-3-He-3 data. Freshwater is primarily of Na-Ca-Mg-HCO3- and Ca-Na-HCO3-Cl type, while lowly mineralized precipitation and saltwater are of Na-Cl types. A trend towards heavier stable isotope signatures and higher electric conductivities in the shallower, younger groundwater within the freshwater lens may indicate increasing atmospheric temperatures in the last 30 years.

AB  - Lake eutrophication is a large and growing problem in many parts of the world, commonly due to anthropogenic sources of nutrients. Improved quantification of nutrient inputs is required to address this problem, including better determination of exchanges between groundwater and lakes. This first of a two-part review provides a brief history of the evolution of the study of groundwater exchange with lakes, followed by a listing of the most commonly used methods for quantifying this exchange. Rates of exchange between lakes and groundwater compiled from the literature are statistically summarized for both exfiltration (flow from groundwater to a lake) and infiltration (flow from a lake to groundwater), including per cent contribution of groundwater to lake-water budgets. Reported rates of exchange between groundwater and lakes span more than five orders of magnitude. Median exfiltration is 0.74cm/day, and median infiltration is 0.60cm/day. Exfiltration ranges from near 0% to 94% of input terms in lake-water budgets, and infiltration ranges from near 0% to 91% of loss terms. Median values for exfiltration and infiltration as percentages of input and loss terms of lake-water budgets are 25% and 35%, respectively. Quantification of the groundwater term is somewhat method dependent, indicating that calculating the groundwater component with multiple methods can provide a better understanding of the accuracy of estimates. The importance of exfiltration to a lake budget ranges widely for lakes less than about 100ha in area but generally decreases with increasing lake area, particularly for lakes that exceed 100ha in area. No such relation is evident for lakes where infiltration occurs, perhaps because of the smaller sample size. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the relevance to groundwater management of Ostrom's design principles for managing common property resources. Experience in four case studies of groundwater management in the Murray Darling Basin in Australia and the Upper Guadiana Basin in Spain suggests that while Ostrom's design principles are relevant, sustainable groundwater management depends on the effective collaboration between government authorities and water users. A flexible and adaptive management approach is required, with collaboration between scientists, policy makers, water suppliers, and water users. Key management challenges include agreeing on a sustainable level of extraction, and establishing effective coordination and collaboration, and monitoring and control systems. Further case studies of groundwater management and their synthesis could make a useful contribution to the transition towards sustainable groundwater management regimes.

AB  - Water resources in agriculture-dominated basins of the arid western United States are stressed due to long-term impacts from pumping. A review of 88 regional groundwater-flow modeling applications from seven intensively irrigated western states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas) was conducted to provide hydrogeologists, modelers, water managers, and decision makers insight about past modeling studies that will aid future model development. Groundwater models were classified into three types: resource evaluation models (39 %), which quantify water budgets and act as preliminary models intended to be updated later, or constitute re-calibrations of older models; management/planning models (55 %), used to explore and identify management plans based on the response of the groundwater system to water-development or climate scenarios, sometimes under water-use constraints; and water rights models (7 %), used to make water administration decisions based on model output and to quantify water shortages incurred by water users or climate changes. Results for 27 model characteristics are summarized by state and model type, and important comparisons and contrasts are highlighted. Consideration of modeling uncertainty and the management focus toward sustainability, adaptive management and resilience are discussed, and future modeling recommendations, in light of the reviewed models and other published works, are presented.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers due to human intervention has become a major challenge in different parts of the world. This review highlights some of the factors influencing saltwater intrusion processes in coastal aquifers, and discusses the methodologies proposed for development of management strategies on a regional scale, utilizing solutions of mathematical models. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the development of mathematical tools for evolving optimal management strategies aimed at controlling saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. This article also reviews different modelling techniques utilized, and offers a brief account of management strategies prescribed by several researchers. Two types of modelling approaches exist in the literature: descriptive models aiming at simulating the physical processes analytically or numerically for evaluating the impact of a chosen management strategy, and prescriptive models for choosing optimal aquifer management strategies. Recent trend is to develop artificial-intelligence-based surrogate models trained by using random inputs and corresponding numerical outputs in order to develop coastal aquifer management strategy. Therefore, different surrogate modelling approaches aimed at reducing the computational burden in a linked simulation-optimization methodology are also highlighted in this review. Furthermore, this review provides a brief outline of the development of methodologies for optimal monitoring network design and sequential compliance monitoring of the real life consequences of implementing prescribed management strategies for coastal aquifers.

AB  - Groundwater is one of the most critical natural resources in an era of climate change, yet groundwater depletion is extensive in many parts of the world. The Pajaro Valley, an agricultural region in Central California, exemplifies the common challenges to sustainably manage a groundwater basin. This article draws on materialist conceptions of power and political economy, and humanist conceptions of place identity and dependence, to illuminate how both can influence groundwater management practices. Through ethnographic observation and interviews with self-identified groundwater users, we find that social character, economic interactions, and dominant understandings of culture and community all work together to define personal and collective meanings of and attachments to place. We suggest that using a "politics of place" approach can provide a deeper understanding of why particular groundwater management practices occur, and that this can aid in shaping future sustainability efforts.

AB  - Groundwater is a vital resource in California, and the concept of "sustainable yield" is an attempt to determine a metric that can ensure the long-term resilience of groundwater systems. However, its meaning is ambiguous and quantification is challenging. To provide insight into developing a working definition that encompasses the inherent uncertainty and complexity of the term, this paper examines how sustainable yield in groundwater is interpreted by (1) scientists, (2) the courts in groundwater adjudications, (3) state agencies, and (4) local water practitioners. Through qualitative interviews, this paper identifies problems that local water agencies in the state encounter in engaging with sustainable yield as they incorporate the term in groundwater management practices. The authors recommend that any definitions make explicit the human dimensions of, and assumptions embedded in, the use of these terms in groundwater management practices, and they point to the value of participation in this process.

AB  - Groundwater, a critical resource in many parts of the world, is often characterized as a common pool resource (Brozovic et al., 2006). Multiple individuals utilize groundwater from a basin, and each person has the capacity to reduce the quantity or quality available to others. We turn to a case study of the Pajaro Groundwater Basin in Central California to re-envision the characterization of "commons." While providing a useful frame from which to analyze groundwater depletion in the Pajaro, we find Common Pool Resource (CPR) theory to be imprecise in its approach to a geographic scale. The notion of the "commons" is central to CPR studies, but there is wide divergence in what the "commons" constitutes, both spatially and socially (Laerhoven and Ostrom, 2007). Rather than propose a normative definition for the "commons," we suggest that the "commons" as a geographic category is socially constructed and dynamically active over time, akin to the analytic of scale as developed within the fields of political ecology and geography. This move from situating the "commons" as a fixed and discrete geographic area to that which is constantly changing and relational helps us to better understand the ways in which water users collaborate and communicate around shared groundwater sources.

AB  - The Pajaro River, central coastal California, consistently loses 0.2-0.4 m(3)/s of discharge along an 11.42-km experimental reach late in the water year, when discharge is <= 4.5 m(3)/s. Channel toss occurs throughout this reach, but is greatest in magnitude near the bottom of the reach. Water isotopic data and other observations suggest that channel loss results mainly from streambed seepage, as opposed to evapotranspiration. If it occurs throughout the year, the channel loss along this short stream reach could contribute 6-13 x 10(6) m(3) Of annual aquifer recharge, or similar to 20-40% of current sustainable basin yield. We performed a series of tracer injections along this reach to determine if hydrologic exchange occurs within this strongly-losing stream. We found that during periods of high channel loss, there were also comparable storage exchange fluxes and lateral inflow of tracer-free water. Within upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, storage exchange fluxes are about 10 times greater than lateral inflow. The former are associated with the movement of water between the main channel and surface or subsurface storage zones. In this system, it is likely that the tatter are primarily associated with spatially- or temporally-long subsurface flow paths within the shallow streambed, as opposed to inflow of ground water from deeper in the basin. Along both upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, lateral inflow tends to increase as channel discharge decreases. In contrast, storage exchange fluxes increase with decreasing discharge along the upper parts of the reach, but decrease with decreasing discharge along the Lower parts. Gauging and tracer test results suggest that subsurface storage exchange and loss may occur simultaneously, and that the lateral inflow of tracer-free water can be caused by long-scale subsurface flow as well as ground water making its first appearance in the channel.

AB  - Adequate characterization of aquifer heterogeneity is critically important for the sustainable use, protection, and remediation of groundwater resources. The combined use of hydrological and geophysical measurements is arguably the most effective means of achieving this objective. In this regard, significant progress has been made on the quantitative integration of geophysical and hydrological data at the local scale. However, the extension of such approaches to larger, more regional scales remains a major research challenge. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of a recently developed regional-scale hydrogeophysical data integration approach, which is based on Bayesian sequential simulation, to a field database from Quebec, Canada consisting of low-resolution, surface-based geoelectrical measurements as well as high-resolution direct-push and borehole-based measurements of the electrical and hydraulic conductivities. The results of our study, which involved the integration of data along an approximately 250-m-long survey line, confirm that this novel methodology, with suitable adaptation, is fully applicable to field data and has the potential of providing realistic estimates of the spatial distribution of hydraulic target parameters at the regional-scale. Equally importantly, through the generation of multiple stochastic realizations, the methodology allows for quantitative assessment of the uncertainty associated with the inferred subsurface models, which in turn is essential for interpreting subsequent predictions of the flow and transport characteristics of the studied region.

AB  - This research underlines the need to improve water management policies for areas linked to confined karstic aquifers subjected to intensive exploitation, and to develop additional efforts towards monitoring their subsidence evolution. We analyze subsidence related to intensive use of groundwater in a confined karstic aquifer, through the use of the InSAR technique, by the southern coast of Spain (Costa del Sol). Carbonates are overlain by an unconfined detritic aquifer with interlayered high transmissivity rocks, in connection with the Mediterranean Sea, where the water level is rather stable. Despite this, an accumulated deformation in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction greater than -100 mm was observed by means of the ERS-1/2 (1992-2000) and Envisat 2003-2009) satellite SAR sensors. During this period, the Costa del Sol experienced a major population increase due to the expansion of the tourism industry, with the consequent increase in groundwater exploitation. The maximum LOS displacement rates recorded during both time spans are respectively -6 mm/yr and -11 mm/yr, respectively. During the entire period, there was an accumulated descent of the confined water level of 140 m, and several fluctuations of more than 80 m correlating with the subsidence trend observed for the whole area. Main sedimentary depocenters (up to 800 m), revealed by gravity prospecting, partly coincide with areas of subsidence maxima; yet ground deformation is also influenced by other factors, the main ones being the fine-grained facies distribution and rapid urbanization due to high touristic pressure.

AB  - This article examines the effects of the new e-citizens' digital skills in their behaviour as e-tourists. It analyses how European digital citizens behave in digital tourism, and whether there are any geographical differences. We have observed that the most influential factor for these e-Tourism activities is having made purchases via the Internet in the past 12months. Differences have been detected between the more developed and less developed areas of Europe, which could indicate a digital divide. Therefore, the results indicate divergent behaviour patterns in digital travel and accommodation, as well as divergent trends in different EU geographical areas.

AB  - The structural water deficit suffered by the Segura basin in southern Spain trend toward unsustainability. The imbalance between the resources and the demand has been caused by the expansion of irrigated areas, the emergence of illegal new irrigated lands and pumping wells, the increase in energy cost and the bad management of water use rights by the public water administration. In addition, climate change and frequent drought in this semi-arid region aggravate the situation. As a consequence, many aquifers are overexploited. The region of Murcia has well-developed agri-food sector, Which is a key factor in, the regional economy. This sector accounts for 21.4% of the regional GDP, and Murcia also has an important tourism sector, so the overexploitation of the aquifers would concern production, exportation and agricultural development as well as the decline in the water level, environmental damage and water quality impairment. On the other hand, the fulfilment of the "good ecological status" objectives set by the Water Framework Directive, with a deadline of 2027, will be a difficult task for water managers. This study proposed a hydroeconomic model to obtain the cost of the overexploited aquifers in the Segura basin in order to decide on the feasibility of using groundwater for agriculture in situations of overexploitation. The results showed that the price paid by farmers for irrigation water in the year 2027 would be 0.53(sic)/m(3) (i.e., annual spending of 180(sic)), which will involve 10% of the final agricultural crop production in the Region of Murcia. Alternative water sources are proposed to increase water supply security for farmers and to ensure the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of the basin. Finally, the methodology proposed would help to manage water use in other European Mediterranean basins under similar climatic, hydrological and agricultural conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large diameter wells in shallow weathered aquifers provide a valuable source of water for domestic and agricultural purposes in many locations including the Indian subcontinent. However, when used for irrigation, these wells often fail towards the end of the dry season. By considering two case studies in the dry and intermediate rainfall zones of Sri Lanka, reasons for the limited yield of these wells are identified. The first case study is concerned with a sloping catchment; a significant proportion of the precipitation during the rainy season either becomes runoff or passes down-gradient through the aquifer and is discharged at the ground surface. Furthermore, during the dry season, groundwater discharge continues. In the second case study the topography is generally flat but, even though the aquifer fills most years during the rainy season, there is often only sufficient water to irrigate about half of each farmer's holding. These investigations are based on field information and the development of conceptual and computational models. Of critical importance in assessing the long term yield of a well is the formation of a seepage face on the side of the well, with the water table a significant distance above the pumping water level. Consequently the water table may only be lowered to about half the depth of the well. The paper concludes with recommendations for the exploitation of groundwater from shallow weathered aquifers to minimise the risk of failure during the dry season. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Identifying flow processes in multi-aquifer flow systems is a considerable challenge, especially if substantial abstraction occurs. The Rajshahi Barind groundwater flow system in Bangladesh provides an example of the manner in which flow processes can change with time. At some locations there has been a decrease with time in groundwater heads and also in the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations. This report describes the important stages in a detailed field and modelling study at a specific location in this groundwater flow system. To understand more about the changing conditions, piezometers were constructed in 2015 at different depths but the same location; water levels in these piezometers indicate the formation of an additional water table. Conceptual models are described which show how conditions have changed between the years 2000 and 2015. Following the formation of the additional water table, the aquifer system is conceptualised as two units. A pumping test is described with data collected during both the pumping and recovery phases. Pumping test data for the Lower Unit are analysed using a computational model with estimates of the aquifer parameters; the model also provided estimates of the quantity of water moving from the ground surface, through the Upper Unit, to provide an input to the Lower Unit. The reasons for the substantial changes in the groundwater heads are identified; monitoring of the recently formed additional water table provides a means of testing whether over-abstraction is occurring.

AB  - Judicious management of a groundwater system requires an understanding of its hydrogeology and response to various recharge and pumping stresses. However, in developing countries, groundwater resource evaluations are hampered by a lack of adequate data that will allow for its complete characterisation. Under such circumstances it is not uncommon for ad hoc groundwater management measures to be embarked upon, especially during drought conditions. These were the conditions that existed during the 1991/92 drought when the CSIR Stellenbosch evaluated the groundwater resources of an urban aquifer in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Their recommendations revealed that about 3.5x10(6) m(3)/a could be safely abstracted from the aquifer. In this work, a more comprehensive hydrogeological investigation was carried out which included pumping tests, estimation of abstraction rates and recharges, and numerical modelling of the aquifer. The investigations indicate that the aquifer is unconfined with hydraulic conductivity and specific yield ranging from 0.1 m/d to 2.09 m/d and 0.02 to 0.11, respectively. Recharge estimates indicate an annual recharge of 105.5 mm with 38.4%, 52.1% and 9.5% accounting respectively for direct recharge, water mains and sewer leakages. Furthermore, a long-term sustainable annual abstraction of 6.1x10(6) m(3) or 15% of current city water demand can be obtained from the aquifer.

AB  - Sustainable water management (SWM) requires allocating between competing water sector demands, and balancing the financial and social resources required to support necessary water systems. The objective of this review is to assess SWM in three sectors: urban, agricultural, and natural systems. This review explores the following questions: (1) How is SWM defined and evaluated? (2) What are the challenges associated with sustainable development in each sector? (3) What are the areas of greatest potential improvement in urban and agricultural water management systems? And (4) What role does country development status have in SWM practices? The methods for evaluating water management practices range from relatively simple indicator methods to integration of multiple models, depending on the complexity of the problem and resources of the investigators. The two key findings and recommendations for meeting SWM objectives are: (1) all forms of water must be considered usable, and reusable, water resources; and (2) increasing agricultural crop water production represents the largest opportunity for reducing total water consumption, and will be required to meet global food security needs. The level of regional development should not dictate sustainability objectives, however local infrastructure conditions and financial capabilities should inform the details of water system design and evaluation.

AB  - A novel methodology is introduced for the spatial indexing of groundwater drought 'risks' (GDRs). It combines reliability analysis and standardised water-level index (SWI), which is readily applicable to areas with sparse data on groundwater depth (GWD) measurements. In reliability analysis, GWDs are reformulated in terms of load, which accounts for external effects, e.g. withdrawals and recharge, as well as resistance, which accounts for system capacity with regard to drought intensities (mild, moderate, severe and extreme). Reliability analysis formulates a novel procedure by using loads and resistance to formulate a performance function, which can be treated by statistical techniques, and thereby derives values of GDR, defined as failure of an operational system but without considering consequences. GDRs at observation wells are spatially distributed by using an interpolation technique. The methodology allows for estimating time variability in GDR to derive an environmental/ecological hazard indicator (EHI), which can serve in the management and planning of predicting groundwater drought. A Graphical User Interface (GDR V.1.0) is developed to serve as a decision support system and to derive GDR and EHI values.

AB  - This study highlights the need for water resource planning and management using expert knowledge to model known extreme hydrologic variability in complex hydrologic systems with lack of data. The Zayandehrud River Basin in Iran is used as an example of complex water system; this study provides a comprehensive description of the basin, including its water demands (municipal, agricultural, industrial and environmental) and water supply resources (rivers, inter-basin water transfer and aquifers). The objective of this study is to evaluate near future conditions of the basin (from Oct./2015 to Sep./2019) considering the current water management policies and climate change conditions, referred as Baseline scenario. A planning model for the Zayandehrud basin was built to evaluate the Baseline scenario, the period of hydrologic analysis is 21 years, (from Oct./1991 to Sep./2011); it was calibrated for 17 years and validated for 4 years using a Historic scenario that considered historic water supply, infrastructure and hydrologic conditions. Because the Zayandehrud model is a planning model and not a hydrologic model (rainfall runoff model), an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used to generate synthetic natural flows considering temperature and precipitation as inputs. This model is an expert knowledge and data based model which has the benefits of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS). Outputs of the ANFIS model were compared to the Historic scenario results and are used in the Baseline scenario. Three metrics are used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the ANFIS model. Water supply results of the Baseline scenario are analyzed using five performance criteria: time-based and volumetric reliability, resilience, vulnerability and maximum deficit. One index, the Water Resources Sustainability Index is used to summarize the performance criteria results and to facilitate comparison among trade-offs. Results for the Baseline scenario show that water demands will be supplied at the cost of depletion of surface and groundwater resource, making this scenario undesirable, unsustainable and with the potential of irreversible negative impact in water sources. Hence, the current water management policy is not viable; there is a need for additional water management policies that reduce water demand through improving irrigation efficiency and reduction of groundwater extraction for sustainable water resources management in the Zayandehrud basin.

AB  - Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was successfully applied in Makaha watershed to investigate the hydrologic impact of groundwater pumping on the streamflow. DHSVM was calibrated (1971-1980) and validated (1981-1990) against observed streamflow during pre-development conditions. Monthly observed and simulated streamflows after the development (after 1990) were compared to quantify the decline in streamflow. Simulation results indicate that declines in streamflow could be attributed to: (i) an increase in the fraction of gross rainfall converted into evapotranspiration (ET); and (ii) groundwater pumping. Groundwater pumping from additional groundwater development in the form of new pumping wells starting in 1991 has significantly reduced the streamflow, especially during the summer. The fraction of gross rainfall converted into ET has significantly increased by 7% during 1991-2009 compared to the pre-development period. Based on the model results, in the absence of the groundwater development in the upper part of Makaha watershed, the observed cumulative streamflow could have been 11% higher than its current level. On an annual basis, total additional groundwater pumping accounts for 26% of the recharge with a significant seasonal variability (12% in wet and 180% in dry season). Relative to recharge, higher groundwater pumping during the dry season could have been the reason behind the significant streamflow decline during the summer. This study clearly emphasizes the importance of temporal patterns in groundwater withdrawal which are often ignored while determining safe yield. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interaction plays a vital role in the functioning of riparian ecosystem, as well as sustainable water resources management. In this study, temporal dynamics of GW-SW interaction were investigated under climate change. A case study was chosen for a study area along the Kiskatinaw River in Mainstem sub-watershed of the Kiskatinaw River Watershed, British Columbia, Canada. A physically based and distributed GW-SW interaction model, Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA), was used. Two different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (i.e., A2: heterogeneous world with self-reliance and preservation of local identities, and B1: more integrated and environmental friendly world) of SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) from Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used for climate change study for 2020-2040. The simulation results showed that climate change influences significantly the temporal patterns of GW-SW interaction by generating variable temporal mean groundwater contributions to streamflow. Due to precipitation variability, these contributions varied monthly, seasonally, and annually. The mean annual groundwater contribution to streamflow during 2020-2040 under the A2 and B1 scenarios is expected to be 74.5% (sigma = 2%) and 75.6% (sigma = 3%), respectively. As compared to that during the base modeling period (2007-2011), the mean annual groundwater contribution to streamflow during 2020-2040 under the A2 and B1 scenarios is expected to decrease by 5.5% and 4.4%, respectively, due to the increased precipitation (on average 6.7% in the A2 and 4.8% in the B1 scenarios) and temperature (on average 0.83 degrees C in the A2 and 0.64 degrees C in the B1 scenarios). The results obtained from this study will provide useful information in the long-term seasonal and annual water extractions from the river for future water supply, as well as for evaluating the ecological conditions of the stream, which will be beneficial to aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Process-based groundwater models are useful to understand complex aquifer systems and make predictions about their response to hydrological changes. A conceptual model for evaluating responses to environmental changes is presented, considering the hydrogeologic framework, flow processes, aquifer hydraulic properties, boundary conditions, and sources and sinks of the groundwater system. Based on this conceptual model, a quasi-three-dimensional transient groundwater flow model was designed using MODFLOW to simulate the groundwater system of Mahanadi River delta, eastern India. The model was constructed in the context of an upper unconfined aquifer and lower confined aquifer, separated by an aquitard. Hydraulic heads of 13 shallow wells and 11 deep wells were used to calibrate transient groundwater conditions during 1997-2006, followed by validation (2007-2011). The aquifer and aquitard hydraulic properties were obtained by pumping tests and were calibrated along with the rainfall recharge. The statistical and graphical performance indicators suggested a reasonably good simulation of groundwater flow over the study area. Sensitivity analysis revealed that groundwater level is most sensitive to the hydraulic conductivities of both the aquifers, followed by vertical hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer. The calibrated model was then employed to explore groundwater-flow dynamics in response to changes in pumping and recharge conditions. The simulation results indicate that pumping has a substantial effect on the confined aquifer flow regime as compared to the unconfined aquifer. The results and insights from this study have important implications for other regional groundwater modeling studies, especially in multi-layered aquifer systems.

AB  - Quantification of groundwater resources is indispensable for developing an efficient strategy for sustainable groundwater management. Integration of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques with multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has emerged as a powerful tool for the economical and rapid assessment of groundwater resources at a macroscale. The main intent of this study is to evaluate the performance of two GIS-based approaches, namely MCDA as Approach I and probabilistic modeling as Approach II for groundwater prospecting. In Approach I, the thematic layers and their features relevant to groundwater prospect were extracted using RS and GIS, and appropriate weightages were assigned to individual layers and their features based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) scale. After the normalization of these weights, the selected thematic layers were integrated in the GIS environment to generate a groundwater prospect map. In Approach II, two probabilistic models, viz. frequency ratio (FR) and weight of evidence (WOE), were used. The FR and WOE probability values were calculated for each of the selected themes and then groundwater prospect maps were generated by overlaying the themes in GIS. The groundwater prospect maps thus obtained by the two approaches were classified into four distinct groundwater potential zones. These maps were verified using the available well-yield data. The verification results indicated that out of the AHP, FR and WOE techniques, the AHP technique is superior (prediction accuracy of 77 %) to the probabilistic models (FR and WOE), though the WOE model also performed reasonably well with a prediction accuracy of 73 %. It is concluded that for more reliable results, the AHP technique can be used for assessing groundwater potential in a given area/region. The findings of this study are useful for the cost-effective identification of suitable well locations as well as for the efficient planning and development of groundwater resources.

AB  - This paper attempts to estimate the possible rate of land subsidence of Kolkata City including Salt Lake City and the adjoining East Kolkata Wetlands located at the lower part of the deltaic alluvial plain of South Bengal basin. Demand of groundwater for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes has increased clue to rapid urbanization. The subsurface geology consists of Quaternary sediments comprising a succession of clay, silty clay and sand of various grades. Groundwater occurs mostly under confined condition except in those places where the top aquitard has been obliterated due to the scouring action of past channels. Currently, the piezometric head shows a falling trend and it may be accelerated due to further over-withdrawal of groundwater resulting in land subsidence. The estimated mean land subsidence rate is 13.53 mm/year and for 1 m drop in the piezometric head, the mean subsidence is 3.28 cm. The surface expression of the estimated land subsidence is however, cryptic because of a time lag between the settlement of the thick low-permeable aquitard at the top and its surface expression. Therefore, groundwater of the cities and wetland areas should be developed cautiously based on the groundwater potential to minimize the threat of land subsidence.

AB  - Most major cities in Malaysia face problems of clean and safe water supply. The blame is on the population boom, industrialisation, pollution plus climate change. It becomes more complicated with uncontrolled usage, public's ignorance and ineffective water management. These problems have led to higher dependencies towards alternative usage of groundwater to serve the needs of public, agricultural sector and the industries. Groundwater usage must be abstracted sustainably to avoid short and long term effects. This exploratory qualitative study analyses several aspects: (a) existing documents on Malaysian water management (b) documents on Malaysian groundwater governance; (c) applications and enforcements of groundwater governance in states. The analyses are essential in recognising and providing appropriate and effective groundwater governance towards higher consumption in the country especially in industrial sector. Early finding reveals the current groundwater governance lack good management and there are legal vacuums. This paper promotes appropriate groundwater governance and management of policies and strategies at both federal and state level, relevant agencies, stakeholders and local communities in ensuring sustainable groundwater resources usage in Malaysia.

AB  - Groundwater recharge variations in time and space are crucial for effective water management, especially in low-precipitation regions. To determine comprehensive groundwater recharge processes in a catchment with large seasonal hydrological variations, intensive field surveys were conducted in the Wangkuai Reservoir watershed located in the Taihang Mountains, North China, during three different times of the year: beginning of the rainy season (June 2011), mid-rainy season (August 2012), and dry season (November 2012). Oxygen and hydrogen isotope and chemical analyses were conducted on the groundwater, spring water, stream water, and reservoir water of the Wangkuai Reservoir watershed. The results were processed using endmember mixing analysis to determine the amount of contribution of the groundwater recharging processes. Similar isotopic and chemical signatures between the surface water and groundwater in the target area indicate that the surface water in the mountain-plain transitional area and the Wangkuai Reservoir are the principal groundwater recharge sources, which result from the highly permeable geological structure of the target area and perennial large-scale surface water, respectively. Additionally, the widespread and significant effect of the diffuse groundwater recharge on the Wangkuai Reservoir was confirmed with the deuterium (d) excess indicator and the high contribution throughout the year, calculated using endmember mixing analysis. Conversely, the contribution of the stream water to the groundwater recharge in the mountain-plain transitional area clearly decreases from the beginning of the rainy season to the mid-rainy season, whereas that of the precipitation increases. This suggests that the main groundwater recharge source shifts from stream water to episodic/continuous heavy precipitation in the mid-rainy season. In other words, the surface water and precipitation commonly affect the groundwater recharge in the rainy season, whereas the reservoir and stream water play important roles in the groundwater recharge in the low-precipitation period. The results should contribute not only to the understanding of the mountain hydrology but also to groundwater resource management in the North China Plain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents the establishment of sustainable development and management policies for the Kucuk Menderes River Basin aquifer system in western Turkey. Geological, hydrogeological, and geophysical data are used conjunctively to define various hydrogeological units and their geometry. Distributions of hydraulic-parameter values and recharge are estimated by geostatistical methods and hydrologic simulations, respectively. A finite-difference groundwater flow model is used to represent the unconfined flow in the aquifer system. The model has been calibrated under steady state and transient conditions. The resulting model was used to test seven management scenarios for a planning period of 21 years to determine the so-called safe yield and sustainable yield of the aquifer system and to investigate the potential impacts of four planned surface water reservoirs on groundwater resources in the basin. The results demonstrate that the continuation of the present pumping rates exceeds both the safe yield and the sustainable yield of the aquifer system. Consequently, the growing need for irrigation water should be met by the construction of the planned surface water reservoirs and the implementation of efficient water management policies and plans.

AB  - Many environmental problems are rooted in human behavior. This study aimed to explore the causal effect of cultural environmental bias on 'sustainable behavior' among agricultural groundwater users in Fars province, Iran, according to Klockner's comprehensive model. A survey-based research project was conducted to gathering data on the paradigm of environmental psychology. The sample included agricultural groundwater users (n = 296) who were selected at random within a structured sampling regime involving study areas that represent three (higher, medium and lower) bounds of the agricultural-groundwater-vulnerability spectrum. Results showed that the "environment as ductile (EnAD)" variable was a strong determinant of sustainable behavior as it related to groundwater use, and that EnAE had the highest causal effect on the behavior of agricultural groundwater users. The adjusted model explained 41% variance of "groundwater sustainable behavior". Based on the results, the groundwater sustainable behaviors of agricultural groundwater users were found to be affected by personal and subjective norm variables and that they are influenced by casual effects of the "environment as ductile (EnAD)" variable. The conclusions reflect the Fars agricultural groundwater users' attitude or worldview on groundwater as an unrecoverable resource; thus, it is necessary that scientific disciplines like hydrogeology and psycho-sociology be considered together in a comprehensive approach for every groundwater study.

AB  - Adaptation to increasing irrigation cost due to declination of groundwater level is a major challenge in groundwater dependent irrigated region. The objective of this study is to estimate the optimum abstraction of groundwater for irrigation for sustainable management of groundwater resources in Northwest Bangladesh. A data-driven model using a support vector machine (SVM) has been developed to estimate the optimum abstraction of groundwater for irrigation and a multiple-linear regression(MLR)-based model has been developed to estimate the reduction of the irrigation cost due to the elevation of the groundwater level. The application of the SVM model revealed that the groundwater level in the area can be kept within the suction lift of a shallow tube-well by reducing pre-monsoon groundwater-dependent irrigated agriculture by 40%. Adaptive measures, such as reducing the overuse of water for irrigation and rescheduling harvesting, can keep the minimum level of groundwater within the reach of shallow tube-wells by reducing only 10% of groundwater-based irrigated agriculture. The elevation of the groundwater level through those adaptive measures can reduce the irrigation cost by 2.07 x 103 Bangladesh Taka (BDT) per hectare in Northwest Bangladesh, where the crop production cost is increasing due to the decline of the groundwater level. It is expected that the study would help in policy planning for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the region.

AB  - A key policy question in designing urban water policy and institutional reforms is: what should be the appropriate structure of water charges to ensure long-term sustainability of water service? This is because water pricing touches on equity and on the willingness of the consumer to pay, but more on its affordability. This study focuses on understanding the nature of household demand for water, and attempts to express the household demand functions. A panel of data of 10,564 complete observations on water bills, drawn from a household expenditure survey conducted in 2003, is used to estimate domestic water demand function. Price and other dummy variables were used in the analysis and the results discussed. Specifically, the household water demand and the per capita demand are analysed, taking into consideration such variables as marginal price, rate structure premium and level of household income. The results show that the estimated water demand is inelastic and so is the income elasticity. The effect of the findings on water policy making in regard to pricing is cited. Limitations of price effectiveness as a tool to curtail water consumption are highlighted.

AB  - The water balance of the mesocenozoic aquifers of the Algarve, in the south of Portugal has traditionally been estimated considering only direct ("autogenic") recharge from rainfall occurring in the area of the aquifers. Little importance has been attributed to so-called allogenic recharge, originating from streambed infiltration from runoff generated outside the aquifers, particularly in the Palaeozoic rocks to the north where runoff is high. The Querenca-Silves (QS) aquifer is the most important aquifer of the region both for irrigation and public water supply. Several important and sensitive surface/groundwater ecotones and associated groundwater dependent ecosystems exist at the springs of the natural discharge areas of the aquifer system. A numerical flow model has been in constant development over the last few years and currently is able to reproduce the aquifer's responses to estimated direct recharge and abstraction for the years 2001-2010. However, recharge calculations for the model do not take into account allogenic recharge infiltration along influent reaches of streams. The quantification of allogenic recharge may further improve the assessment of water availability and exploitation risks. In this paper an attempt is made to quantify the average annual contribution of allogenic recharge to the QS aquifer, based on monitoring data of the principal water courses that cross the aquifer system. Significant uncertainties related to surface runoff generated within the aquifer area, as well as areal recharge were identified and the consequences for the optimization of spatial distribution of transmissivity in the groundwater flow model are also addressed.

AB  - The Rio Grande, a semi-arid river in the American Southwest, is a major source of surface water for agriculture and municipal purposes in New Mexico and western Texas. In addition to increasing salinity, considerable increases in nitrate (NO3-) concentrations have been observed in the semi-arid portion of the Rio Grande. It is possible that elevated water salinity inhibits denitrification on irrigated fields and, thus fails to mediate the excess nutrient load from anthropogenic activities. Therefore, the two major goals of this study were to i) characterize and quantify major NO3- sources, and ii) assess whether elevated water salinity affects microbial denitrification in the watershed. In fall 2014 and summer 2015, the Rio Grande surface water, irrigation drains, precipitation (urban runoff), and municipal waste effluents were sampled between Elephant Butte, New Mexico and Tornillo, Texas (similar to 260 km distance) for chemical and stable isotope analyses. The highest NO3- concentrations, up to similar to 70-140 mg/L, were observed in waste effluents and agricultural drains irrigated with the reclaimed city water. Conversely, NO3- concentrations in the river and agricultural drains were significantly lower (<1-10 mg/L) in the areas farther away from urban centers. Two major NO3- sources were identified using isotope tracers: fertilizers, with low delta N-15 and high delta O-18 (average + 0.6 and + 18.3 parts per thousand, respectively), and waste water effluents from cities, with high delta N-15 and low delta O-18 (average + 10.5 and -5.1 parts per thousand, respectively). According to nitrogen isotope mass balance constraint, the contribution of waste effluent-derived NO3- was the smallest in upstream locations, between Elephant Butte and Las Cruces, and accounted for up to 0-25% (+/- 10%) compared to the fertilizer-derived NO3-. Further downstream near big urban centers, the effluent contributions increased and accounted for up to 70-100% between Las Cruces and El Paso. The highest effluent-derived NO3- contributions of 90-100% were measured in the agricultural district located below El Paso where the reclaimed city water is commonly used for irrigation. Elevated salinity does not appear to limit microbial denitrification. Locally, the strongest isotopic evidence of microbial denitrification was observed in a couple of water samples showing elevated salinity (EC 2.9-4.2 mS/cm). The results of this study suggest that urban centers are important NO3- contributors into the aquatic system of the semi-arid Rio Grande watershed, and that microbial processes (e.g., denitrification) do not appear to significantly reduce NO3- loads from anthropogenic sources.

AB  - The nexus between energy, water and agricultural production is important to consider for effective resource management and risk mitigation. New data acquisition techniques, in conjunction with cheap storage applications, have facilitated the collection and analysis of massive datasets to holistically describe natural and built environments. However, the field of coupling energy, water and agricultural management through evolving remote sensing technologies is still nascent. We find that remote sensing technologies are being increasingly utilized for resource management, but there are still large opportunities to deploy these technologies to achieve integrated resource management goals. Thus, this article aims to bridge remote sensing and integrated resource management communities, which have largely developed in isolation, so that technologies can be developed to assist in achieving sustainable development. The opportunities and challenges highlighted in this article can guide technology development, research opportunities and create new interdisciplinary research partnerships. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cultural factors - values, beliefs, and norms - provide important insights into the environmental attitudes, risk perceptions, and behaviors of the general population. Little is known, however, about the ostensibly complex relationships linking those elements of culture to climate change risk perceptions, especially in the context of farm level decision in the ground water context. This paper addresses that gap through an analysis of survey data provided by irrigators in the Namoi catchment of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. We use Values-Beliefs-Norms theory to construct multivariate models of the relationship between ground water irrigators' interpretations of climate change risks and their implementation of adaptive water conservation practices. Results indicate that these cultural factors are important explanations of irrigators' climate change risk perceptions, and these risk perceptions are related to adaptive ground water management strategies at the farm level. The implications of the findings are discussed for research on the culture-environment nexus and for outreach designed to encourage agricultural adaptations to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Western Kansas is one of the most important agricultural regions in the world. Most agricultural production in this semi-arid region depends on the consumption of nonrenewable groundwater from the High Plains Aquifer, which will be 70 % depleted by 2070. The problem of depletion has drawn significant attention from local citizens and policymakers at the federal, state, and local levels for at least 40 years, resulting in a variety of policies and institutions to manage groundwater from the aquifer as a common pool resource. Yet depletion has persisted. We explain this conundrum as an outcome of a mismatch between the scale of resource management, which has become more intensively local, and the scale of resource exchange, which has rendered the High Plains Aquifer a global common pool resource. We then explain the deeper, structural origins of the management-exchange scale mismatch. Drawing on concepts from structural human ecology theory and empirical evidence from Southwest Kansas, we show that agriculture is predicated on local metabolic rift in the hydrological cycle that is exacerbated through ecological unequal exchange with higher-income, core areas beyond the region. We conclude by highlighting two key policies that, if implemented together, may lessen the deleterious effects of these structural dynamics and thus promote a more sustainable relationship between society and environment in this region and other water-scarce regions that are net-exporters of groundwater.

AB  - The Mancha Oriental System (MOS) has a surface area of 7,260 km(2), making it one of the largest carbonate aquifer systems in Spain. The system sustains about 1,000 km(2) of irrigated crops and supplies groundwater to 275,000 inhabitants. The economic transformation brought about by the development of extensive irrigated cropland has led to a water-balance disequilibrium of about 75 million m(3)/year. This input-output deficit has negative consequences in the quantity and quality of the available resources, in the river-aquifer relationship, and in the associated ecosystems as well. To understand the hydrogeological behaviour of the system, it is necessary to design a conceptual model. Further, the conceptualisation of a groundwater flow system is a requirement of the European Water Framework Directive for the characterisation of groundwater bodies. The robustness of the conceptual model depends heavily on the user capability of representing the real system. In this work, a multidisciplinary approach has been used to represent the three-dimensional geological framework and the groundwater flow conceptualisation of the MOS. Data management and three-dimensional visualisation have been carried out by means of geographical information system (GIS) tools and software for contouring and three-dimensional surface mapping.

AB  - In India, particularly in semi-arid regions, groundwater levels are declining at alarming rates due to over-exploitation and the sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources is in deep crisis. There is little or no information on groundwater sustainability indicators, which can signal towards the challenges in water management. In this study we downscaled an entire watershed into three zones based on the different hydrodynamic behaviour recorded at the borewell scale. A process-based simple, multi-parameter linear auto-regressive model was developed to predict groundwater levels, which uses recharge, groundwater withdrawal and irrigation return flow as input variables. A comprehensive and predictive long-term groundwater balance is used as a state indicator to evaluate the sustainability and management challenges in the watershed. Two groundwater withdrawal scenarios were designed to assess the impact of groundwater withdrawal on the groundwater balance. We found that geological heterogeneities play a crucial role in controlling groundwater fluctuations. The storage change in two different groundwater withdrawal scenarios shows gradually declining groundwater storage in both scenarios. A long-term assessment of the groundwater balance helps to analyse the state of the groundwater system and to locate priority zones for watershed interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An attempt has been made in the Upper Vellar sub-basin to assess the hydrogeochemical processes influencing the water chemistry along with suitability of water for domestic and agricultural utilities. A total of 35 groundwater samples were collected for two different seasons, premonsoon (PRM) and post monsoon (POM), and analyzed for major cations, anions, and trace elements. The obtained results indicate that the dominance of silicate weathering, ion exchange process, and anthropogenic and microbial activities alter the chemistry of groundwater. The Piper plot suggests the facies evolution from Ca-HCO3, Ca-Mg-Cl and mixed Ca-Na-HCO3 and NaCl fluxes influencing the water chemistry. The ionic ratio plots suggest the predominance of Na+, Ca2+, HCO3- and Cl- indicating the silicate minerals dissolution and anthropogenic activities. All the trace elements are within the scale; however, Zn exceeds the WHO standard. The stability plot suggests samples representing kaolinite field during PRM and evolves towards montmorillonite and chloride field during POMinfers the dissolution of silicates minerals and ions from host rocks. According to the WHO standard, 23% of PRM and 6% of POM water samples exceed the maximum permissible limits for drinking purposes.

AB  - Alluvial strip aquifers associated with ephemeral rivers are important groundwater supply sources that sustain numerous settlements and ecological systems in arid Namibia. More than 70 % of the population in the nation's western and southern regions depend on alluvial aquifers associated with ephemeral rivers. Under natural conditions, recharge occurs through infiltration during flood events. Due to the characteristic spatial and temporal variability of rainfall in arid regions, recharge is irregular making the aquifers challenging to manage sustainably and they are often overexploited. This condition is likely to become more acute with increasing water demand and climate change, and artificial recharge has been projected as the apparent means of increasing reliability of supply. The article explores, through a case study and numerical simulation, the processes controlling infiltration, significance of surface water and groundwater losses, and possible artificial recharge options. It is concluded that recharge processes in arid alluvial aquifers differ significantly from those processes in subhumid systems and viability of artificial recharge requires assessment through an understanding of the natural recharge process and losses from the aquifer. It is also established that in arid-region catchments, infiltration through the streambed occurs at rates dependent on factors such as antecedent conditions, flow rate, flow duration, channel morphology, and sediment texture and composition. The study provides an important reference for sustainable management of alluvial aquifer systems in similar regions.

AB  - With constrained Nile water and the cruel drop in per capita freshwater share in Egypt, soil aquifer treatment (SAT) appears an attractive, low-cost, unconventional water resource that is environmentally friendly and relatively easy to operate. Nevertheless, organic micropollutants (OMPs) in treated wastewater pose environmental and health risks if not properly attenuated through vadose zone infiltration. Thus, determination of OMP removal in a SAT system is important for sustainable groundwater management. In this study, a new, simple equation for the prediction of organic micropollutant removal in SAT systems was developed using gene expression programming (GEP). A wide range of 15OMPs and aquifer conditions were examined along with various real operational aspects of SAT systems, including hydraulic loading rate and dry/wet ratio. The effect of spatial heterogeneity on saturated hydraulic conductivity was considered. Developed GEP models had an average coefficient of determination R2 of 0.92. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with 50,000 realizations was used to propagate uncertainty in SAT parameters in order to generate stochastic inputs for the GEP model. It was found that the removal of OMPs in SAT systems is mostly affected by biodegradation rate and soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity, in addition to dry/wet ratio. Finally,the developed GEP models were applied to enhance the criteria for selecting potential sites for SAT systems in Egypt considering OMP. It was shown that a SAT system would perform well at three sites, with a OMP removal efficiency reaching 100%, whereas it would have a removal of only 50% in the other two sites. Uncertainties in predictions were quantified with an average value of 35%. The developed GEP models can serve as basis for preliminary SAT site selection and design, and can substitute for complex commercial modeling software, especially for practitioners and decision makers in feasibility studies. However, for SAT implementation in a selected location, results can be confirmed only through field column tests.

AB  - The ISI (Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure) Envision rating system is designed to be a comprehensive sustainability assessment that can be applied to a wide range of infrastructure projects, including water supply. With water supply resiliency, a prominent concern in many arid and semi-arid regions, the implementation of a water sustainability metric would be beneficial to both regulators and planners. This review seeks to assess the merit of applying Envision to water infrastructure projects specifically designed to enhance supply resiliency by retroactively rating the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) Twin Oaks Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) project. In this review, we find that the novelty and innovation inherent in ASR is largely overlooked by Envision, which often does not evaluate sector-specific concepts. Furthermore, the project-oriented focus of Envision does not analyze water supply systems, or any infrastructure system, as a whole. This paper proposes that a water specific sustainability index be used in conjunction with Envision, to more specifically address concerns for water supply.

AB  - The Kucuk Menderes River Basin in western Turkey has been facing continuous groundwater-level decline for decades. Previous studies have suggested that, to avoid aquifer depletion in the basin, artificial recharge structures should be constructed. To assess artificial aquifer recharge potential in one of the subbasins, a two-dimensional (2-D) groundwater model was set up using SEEP/W software. The material functions and parameters used in the model for both saturated and unsaturated conditions were taken from previous studies. The model has been calibrated under transient conditions. The excess runoff volume that could be collected in the recharge basins was estimated from flood frequency analysis. Various scenarios were simulated to observe the change in groundwater level and storage with respect to different exceedance probabilities. Simulation results suggest that a significant increase in groundwater storage is achieved by applying surface artificial-recharge methods. In addition to the recharge basins, to reinforce the effect of artificial recharge, simulations are repeated with underground dam construction at the downstream side of the basin. Although groundwater storage is increased with the addition of the dam, the increase in groundwater storage was not sufficient to warrant the construction.

AB  - Aquifer overexploitation could significantly impact crop production in the United States because 60% of irrigation relies on groundwater. Groundwater depletion in the irrigated High Plains and California Central Valley accounts for similar to 50% of groundwater depletion in the United States since 1900. A newly developed High Plains recharge map shows that high recharge in the northern High Plains results in sustainable pumpage, whereas lower recharge in the central and southern High Plains has resulted in focused depletion of 330 km(3) of fossil groundwater, mostly recharged during the past 13,000 y. Depletion is highly localized with about a third of depletion occurring in 4% of the High Plains land area. Extrapolation of the current depletion rate suggests that 35% of the southern High Plains will be unable to support irrigation within the next 30 y. Reducing irrigation withdrawals could extend the lifespan of the aquifer but would not result in sustainable management of this fossil groundwater. The Central Valley is a more dynamic, engineered system, with north/south diversions of surface water since the 1950s contributing to similar to 7x higher recharge. However, these diversions are regulated because of impacts on endangered species. A newly developed Central Valley Hydrologic Model shows that groundwater depletion since the 1960s, totaling 80 km(3), occurs mostly in the south (Tulare Basin) and primarily during droughts. Increasing water storage through artificial recharge of excess surface water in aquifers by up to 3 km(3) shows promise for coping with droughts and improving sustainability of groundwater resources in the Central Valley.

AB  - Trade-offs between water-resource depletion and salinization need to be understood when promoting water-conservative irrigation practices. This companion paper assesses impacts of groundwater-fed irrigation on soil water and groundwater quality using data from the southern High Plains (SHP). Unsaturated zone soil samples from 13 boreholes beneath irrigated agroecosystems were analyzed for water-extractable anions. Salt accumulation in soils varies with irrigation water quality, which ranges from low salinity in the north (median Cl: 21 mg/L) to higher salinity in the south (median Cl: 180 mg/L). Large Cl bulges under irrigated agroecosystems in the south are similar to those under natural ecosystems, but they accumulated over decades rather than millennia typical of natural ecosystems. Profile peak Cl concentrations (1200-6400 mg/L) correspond to irrigation efficiencies of 92-98% with respect to drainage and are attributed to deficit irrigation with minimal flushing. Perchlorate (ClO(4)) also accumulates under irrigated agroecosystems, primarily from irrigation water, and behaves similarly to Cl. Most NO(3)-N accumulation is below the root zone. Groundwater total dissolved solids (TDS) have increased by <= 960 mg/L and NO(3)-Nby <= 9.4 mg/L since the early 1960s. Mobilization of salts that have accumulated under irrigated agroecosystems is projected to degrade groundwater much more in the future because of the essentially closed-basin status of the aquifer, with discharge occurring primarily through irrigation pumpage. TDS are projected to increase by an additional 2200 mg/L (median), ClO(4) by 21 mu g/L, and NO(3)-N by 52 mg/L. Water and salt balances should be considered in irrigation management in order to minimize salinization issues.

AB  - [1] Past land use changes have greatly impacted global water resources, with often opposing effects on water quantity and quality. Increases in rain-fed cropland (460%) and pastureland (560%) during the past 300 years from forest and grasslands decreased evapotranspiration and increased recharge ( two orders of magnitude) and streamflow ( one order of magnitude). However, increased water quantity degraded water quality by mobilization of salts, salinization caused by shallow water tables, and fertilizer leaching into underlying aquifers that discharge to streams. Since the 1950s, irrigated agriculture has expanded globally by 174%, accounting for similar to 90% of global freshwater consumption. Irrigation based on surface water reduced streamflow and raised water tables resulting in waterlogging in many areas ( China, India, and United States). Marked increases in groundwater-fed irrigation in the last few decades in these areas has lowered water tables ( <= 1 m/yr) and reduced streamflow. Degradation of water quality in irrigated areas has resulted from processes similar to those in rain-fed agriculture: salt mobilization, salinization in waterlogged areas, and fertilizer leaching. Strategies for remediating water resource problems related to agriculture often have opposing effects on water quantity and quality. Long time lags ( decades to centuries) between land use changes and system response ( e. g., recharge, streamflow, and water quality), particularly in semiarid regions, mean that the full impact of land use changes has not been realized in many areas and remediation to reverse impacts will also take a long time. Future land use changes should consider potential impacts on water resources, particularly trade-offs between water, salt, and nutrient balances, to develop sustainable water resources to meet human and ecosystem needs.

AB  - Water and nutrient availability for crop production are critical issues in (semi)arid regions. Unsaturated-zone Cl tracer data and nutrient (NO3 and PO4) concentrations were used to quantify recharge rates using the Cl mass balance approach and nutrient availability in the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, India. Soil cores were collected in dune/interdune settings in the arid Thar Desert (near Jaisalmer) and in rain-fed (nonirrigated) and irrigated cropland in the semiarid desert margin (near Jaipur). Recharge rates were also simulated using unsaturated zone modeling. Recharge rates in sparsely vegetated dune/interdune settings in the Jaisalmer study area are 2.7-5.6 mm/year (2-3% of precipitation, 165 mm/year). In contrast, recharge rates in rain-fed agriculture in the Jaipur study area are 61-94 mm/year (10-16% of precipitation, 600 mm/year). Minimum recharge rates under current freshwater irrigated sites are 50-120 mm/year (8-20% of precipitation). Nitrate concentrations are low at most sites. Similarity in recharge rates based on SO4 with those based on Cl is attributed to a meteoric origin of SO4 and generally conservative chemical behavior in these sandy soils. Modeling results increased confidence in tracer-based recharge estimates. Recharge rates under rain-fed agriculture indicate that irrigation of 20-40% of cultivated land with 300 mm/year should be sustainable.

AB  - Although irrigated agriculture is the primary consumer of global groundwater resources, information on recharge rates and sustainable irrigation is limited. The study objective was to fingerprint irrigation return flow to quantify percolation/recharge and to estimate sustainable irrigation levels. This paper focuses on water quantity; a companion paper addresses water quality. Soil samples from 13 boreholes drilled beneath irrigated agroecosystems in the southern High Plains were analyzed for matric potential and water-extractable Cl and NO3. Unsaturated zone pore water beneath irrigated agroecosystems can be fingerprinted by higher matric potentials (wetter soils, median mp: -40 m) and higher NO3-N (median 71 mg/L) than beneath natural ecosystems (mp -200 m; NO3-N 8.1 mg/L) and by higher Cl (720 mg/L) than beneath rain-fed agroecosystems (8.4 mg/L). The range in percolation/recharge rates beneath irrigated agroecosystems is 18-97 mm/a (median 41 mm/a; 5% of irrigation + precipitation) and occurs primarily in response to extreme precipitation events. Similarity in percolation/recharge rates beneath irrigated and rain-fed (4.8-92 mm/a) agroecosystems was unexpected and is attributed to low irrigation applications (median 300 mm/a) and increased crop yield and evapotranspiration in irrigated areas. Regional water table declines are unsustainably large (>= 30 m over 10,000 km(2)) in the north and are much lower in the south. Sustainable irrigation in the south would require reduction of the irrigated area from 23% to 9%. Methods developed for quantifying recharge and sustainable irrigation application rates can be applied to groundwater-fed irrigated areas in semiarid regions globally.

AB  - [1] Unsaturated zone chloride profiles in semiarid regions provide a decadal- to century-scale record of past environmental changes, similar to climate change records provided by tree rings and ice cores. Impacts of conversions from natural ecosystems to rain-fed agriculture on water resources are recorded in chloride profiles in semiarid regions, as typified by the southern High Plains (SHP), Texas, southwestern United States. Large chloride accumulations beneath natural grassland and shrubland ecosystems ( 3 profiles) reflect evapotranspirative enrichment of atmospherically derived chloride during the Holocene, indicating no recharge in interdrainage areas. Conversion to rain-fed agriculture is recorded by downward displacement ( 9 profiles) or complete flushing ( 10 profiles) of chloride bulges, indicating increased recharge. Increased recharge associated with cultivation ( median 24 mm/yr, 5% of precipitation, 19 profiles) was quantified using chloride mass balance calculations. The timing of land use change was estimated using chloride data, and results ( 43 - 89 years) are consistent with aerial photo records and landowner surveys. New equilibrium volumetric recharge rates beneath rain-fed agriculture in the SHP (0.63 km(3)/yr) will require decades to establish and represent one to eight times recharge rates for baseline precultivated conditions that are focused beneath ephemeral lake or playa drainages ( 0.08 - 0.83 km(3)/yr). These chloride profiles generally represent decadal- scale monitoring of subsurface response to land use change.

Along the flow paths, recharged groundwater mixes with NaCl-type waters and undergoes calcite dissolution and is further modified by cation exchange (Ca-Na). Consequently, the water loses most of its calcium and the residual delta C-13(DIC) in the groundwater is isotopically enriched. Further modifications take place along the flow path in deeper zones, where depleted delta C-13(DIC) values are overprinted due to SC42- and iron oxide reduction, triggered by the presence of organic matter. Dating with H-3, C-14 and Cl-36 has allowed the differentiation of several zones: recharge zone (<0.06 ky), intermediate zone (0.06-20 ky), deep zone 1(20-30 ky), and deep zone 2 (>30 ky). An apparent link between the tectonic structure and the groundwater residence time zonation can be established. Regional faults clearly separates deep zone 1 from the distinctly older age (>30 ky) deep zone 2. From the estimated residence times, two groundwater areas of different behavior can be differentiated within the aquifer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Walla Walla Basin, in Eastern Oregon and Washington, USA, faces challenges in sustaining an agricultural water supply while maintaining sufficient flow in the Walla Walla River for endangered fish populations. Minimum summer river flow of 0.71 m(3)/s is required, forcing irrigators to substitute groundwater from a declining aquifer for lost surface water diversion. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) was initiated in 2004 attempting to restore groundwater levels and improve agricultural viability. The Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM) was used to compute surface and shallow groundwater conditions in the basin under water management scenarios with varying water use, MAR, and allowable minimum river flow. A mean increase of 1.5 m of groundwater elevation, or 1.5% of total aquifer storage, was predicted over the model area when comparing maximum MAR and no MAR scenarios where minimum river flow was increased from current level. When comparing these scenarios a 53% greater summer flow in springs was predicted with the use of MAR. Results indicate MAR can supplement irrigation supply while stabilizing groundwater levels and increasing summer streamflow. Potential increase in long-term groundwater storage is limited by the high transmissivity of the aquifer material. Increased MAR caused increased groundwater discharge through springs and stream beds, benefiting aquatic habitat rather than building long-term aquifer storage. Judicious siting of recharge basins may be a means of increasing the effectiveness of MAR in the basin.

AB  - Orthophosphorus (OP) is the form of dissolved inorganic P that is commonly measured in groundwater studies, but the spatial distribution of groundwaterOP across awatershed has rarely been assessed. In this study, we characterized spatial patterns of groundwater OP concentrations and loading rates within the 5218 haWalnut Creek watershed (Iowa) over a two-year period. Using a network of 24 shallow (<6 m) monitoring wells established across watershed, OP concentrations ranged from <0.01 to 0.58 mg/l in all samples (n = 147) and averaged 0.084 +/- 0.107 mg/l. Groundwater OP concentrations were higher in floodplains and OP mass loading rates were approximately three times higher than in uplands. We estimated that approximately 1231 kg of OP is present in floodplain groundwater and 2869 kg is present in upland groundwater within the shallow groundwater zone (0-5 m depth). Assuming no new inputs of OP to shallow groundwater, we estimated itwould take approximately eight years to flush out existing OP mass present in the system. Results suggest that conservation practices focused on reducing OP loading rates in floodplain areas may have a disproportionately large water quality benefit compared to upland areas.

AB  - To provide a sound understanding of the sources, pathways, and residence times of groundwater water in alluvial river-aquifer systems, a combined multitracer and modeling experiment was carried out in an important alluvial drinking water wellfield in Switzerland. Rn-222, H-3/He-3, atmospheric noble gases, and the novel Ar-37-method were used to quantify residence times and mixing ratios of water from different sources. With a half-life of 35.1 days, Ar-37 allowed to successfully close a critical observational time gap between Rn-222 and 3H/3He for residence times of weeks to months. Covering the entire range of residence times of groundwater in alluvial systems revealed that, to quantify the fractions of water from different sources in such systems, atmospheric noble gases and helium isotopes are tracers suited for end-member mixing analysis. A comparison between the tracer-based mixing ratios and mixing ratios simulated with a fully-integrated, physically-based flow model showed that models, which are only calibrated against hydraulic heads, cannot reliably reproduce mixing ratios or residence times of alluvial river-aquifer systems. However, the tracer-based mixing ratios allowed the identification of an appropriate flow model parametrization. Consequently, for alluvial systems, we recommend the combination of multitracer studies that cover all relevant residence times with fully-coupled, physically-based flow modeling to better characterize the complex interactions of river-aquifer systems.

AB  - One of the key questions arising from the presence of micro-pollutants in surface-, ground-, and drinking water is whether they pose a risk to human and ecosystem health In our laboratories we. have identified a number of biological effects by several pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) on human, animal and/or plant cells at different levels of biological organisation. In part, these effects occur at concentrations even below those reported in drinking water. Even though it is often still difficult to fully deduce the role of some of these effects on the whole organism or population level as well as after chronic exposure, the effects observed illustrate that the input of micro-pollutants into the environment must be avoided or as far as possible reduced. Much effort has already been devoted to improved treatment of sewage and raw drinking water. A comprehensive protection from aquatic micro-pollutants, however, cannot reside in water treatment technology alone. instead, all components of the life cycle of these chemicals must be put to the table to turn around the current trend of increasing environmental loads. The goal of this report is to illustrate why a more comprehensive way of risk assessment is needed and what this should include.

AB  - Monitored natural attenuation (MNA) as a possible remediation strategy has been intensively discussed over the last several years. However, in order to apply natural attenuation (NA) as a rational remediation option, suitable methods for the assessment and evaluation of the efficiency of these processes must be developed, the sustainability of the NA processes has to be demonstrated and regulatory and public acceptance has to be established. The RETZ-INA (Reference test site Zeitz for the implementation of the "Natural Attenuation" approach) Project deals with the implementation of the MNA approach as a remediation concept at the heavily contaminated former industrial field site Zeitz (Germany). Due to the long history of industrial production, the multiple contaminant sources present and the large spatial extent.

AB  - Urban groundwater is a heritage at risk because urban land use practises puts enormous and highly complex pressure on this resource. In this article, we review urban groundwater studies in the context of urban water management, discuss advances in hydrogeological investigation, monitoring and modelling techniques for urban areas and highlight the challenges. We present how techniques on contaminant concentration measurements, water balancing and contaminant load estimation were applied and further developed for the special requirements in urban settings. To fully understand and quantify the complex urban water systems, we need to refine these methods and combine them with sophisticated modelling approaches. Only then we will be able to sustainably manage our water resources in and around our urban areas especially in light of growing cities and global climatic change. We believe that over the next few years much more effort will be devoted to research in urban hydrogeology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban areas are the focus of major ecological, social and economical activity. They are thus also prime locations of increasing conflict with regard to water use and water protection. As a direct and/or indirect consequence of urban land use and human activity, urban water systems are frequently polluted with organic contaminants including waste water-born xenobiotics such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products (collectively known as PPCPs) and endocrine-active substances. This study reviews new integrated methodologies including flux calculations as well as chemical investigations for determining the impact of human activities on urban water systems and on processes within the urban watershed. The use of indicator substances, representing different contaminant sources and pathways, integral pumping tests and mass balance approaches are suitable alternatives within these environments. The issues are explored using contaminant mass balance examples from Halle/Saale and Leipzig, Germany.

AB  - Urban areas are a focus of increasing conflict with regard to water use and water protection. Half of the world's population and about 73% of Europeans live in cities. Currently, about 82% of the total population growth of the world occurs in the cities of the developing countries (UN 2004). As a direct and/or indirect consequence of human activity, urban water systems are frequently polluted with organic contaminants. Many of these contaminants are related to human behaviour and activity, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products (collectively PPCPs) and endocrine-active substances, and are increasingly found in urban water systems. However, the behaviour and the effects of these contaminants in the environment have been widely unknown until now. Consequently, it is important to pay more attention to such substances and to explore new integrated methodologies (including flux calculations as well as chemical and biological investigations) for determining the impact of human activities on urban water systems and on processes within the urban watershed. The overall goal is to assess the risks to humans and the ecosystem, and to support the development of suitable management strategies.

AB  - We present and test a conceptual and methodological approach for interdisciplinary sustainability assessments of water governance systems based on what we call the sustainability wheel. The approach combines transparent identification of sustainability principles, their regional contextualization through sub-principles (indicators), and the scoring of these indicators through deliberative dialogue within an interdisciplinary team of researchers, taking into account their various qualitative and quantitative research results. The approach was applied to a sustainability assessment of a complex water governance system in the Swiss Alps. We conclude that the applied approach is advantageous for structuring complex and heterogeneous knowledge, gaining a holistic and comprehensive perspective on water sustainability, and communicating this perspective to stakeholders.

AB  - We develop optimal conjunctive use water management strategies that balance two potentially conflicting objectives: sustaining irrigated agriculture during droughts and minimizing unnecessary spills and resulting water losses from the reservoir during wet periods. Conjunctive use is specified by a linear operating rule, which determines the maximum surface water release as a function of initial reservoir storage. Optimal strategies are identified using multiobjective interannual optimization for sustainability and spill control, combined with gradient-based annual profit maximization. Application to historical conditions in the irrigated system of the Yaqui Valley, Mexico, yields a Pareto curve of solutions illustrating the trade-off between sustaining agriculture and minimizing spills and water losses. Minimal water losses are obtained by maximizing surface water use and limiting groundwater pumping, such that reservoir levels are kept sufficiently low. Maximum agricultural sustainability, on the other hand, results from increased groundwater use and keeping surface water reservoir levels high during wet periods. Selected optimal operating rules from the multiobjective optimization are tested over a large number of equally probable streamflow time series, generated with a stochastic time series model. In this manner, statistical properties, such as the mean sustainability and sustainability percentiles, are determined for each optimal rule. These statistical properties can be used to select rules for water management that are reliable over a wide range of streamflow conditions.

AB  - [ 1] This paper investigates strategies to alleviate the effects of droughts on the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture. These strategies include conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources, and engineered improvements such as lining of irrigation canals and addition of regional pumping well capacity. A spatially distributed simulation-optimization model was developed for an irrigated system consisting of multiple surface water reservoirs and an alluvial aquifer. The simulation model consists of an agronomic component and simulators describing the hydrologic system. The physical models account for storage and flow through the reservoirs, routing through the irrigation canals, and regional groundwater flow. The agronomic model describes crop productivity as a function of irrigation quantity and salinity, and determines agricultural profit. A profit maximization problem was formulated and solved using large-scale constrained gradient-based optimization. The model was applied to a real-world conjunctive surface water/groundwater management problem in the Yaqui Valley, an irrigated agricultural region in Sonora, Mexico. The model reproduces recorded reductions in agricultural production during a historical drought. These reductions were caused by a decline in surface water availability and limited installed pumping capacity. Results indicate that the impact of the historical 8-year drought could have been significantly reduced without affecting profit in wet years by better managing surface water and groundwater resources. Namely, groundwater could have been more heavily relied upon and surface water allocation capped at a sustainable level as an operating rule. Lining the irrigation canals would have resulted in water savings of 30% of historical reservoir releases during wet years, which could have been used in subsequent drier years to increase agricultural production. The benefits of a greater reliance on groundwater pumping by installing additional wells are limited due to pumping restrictions near the coast to avoid seawater intrusion and due to increased pumping costs.

AB  - Several controls are known to affect water quality of stream networks during flow recession periods, such as solute leaching processes, surface water-groundwater interactions as well as biogeochemical in-stream turnover processes. Throughout the stream network, combinations of specific water and solute export rates and local in-stream conditions overlay the biogeochemical signals from upstream sections. Therefore, upstream sections can be considered functional units which could be distinguished and ordered regarding their relative contribution to nutrient dynamics at the catchment outlet. Based on snapshot sampling of flow and nitrate concentrations along the stream in an agricultural headwater during the summer flow recession period, we determined spatial and temporal patterns of water quality for the whole stream. A data-driven, in-stream-mixing-and-removal model was developed and applied for analysing the spatio-temporal in-stream retention processes and their effect on the spatio-temporal fluxes of nitrate from subcatchments. Thereby, we have been able to distinguish quantitatively between nitrate sinks, sources per stream reaches, and subcatchments, and thus we could disentangle the overlay of nitrate sink and source signals. For nitrate sources, we determined their permanent and temporal impact on stream water quality and for nitrate sinks, we found increasing nitrate removal efficiencies from upstream to downstream. Our results highlight the importance of distinct nitrate source locations within the watershed for in-stream concentrations and in-stream removal processes, respectively. Thus, our findings contribute to the development of a more dynamic perception of water quality in streams and rivers concerning ecological and sustainable water resource management.

AB  - The Kalu Ganga catchment is one of the largest in Sri Lanka, and is home to 5% of the national population. A first assessment is provided here of the sensitivity of Kalu Ganga runoff to a 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature - the supposed threshold for "dangerous" climate change. Runoff is simulated using the HBV-Light hydrological model and scenario data from seven general circulation models (GCMs). Precipitation is the strongest cause of change in runoff. Substantial inter-GCM differences in scenario precipitation lead to uncertainty in the direction of change in mean annual runoff from the baseline (range -25% to + 19%). Scenario monthly runoff ranges from -41% to +124% of the baseline values at its most extreme (March); June is the only month with a consistent direction of change (range -17% to -65%) - thus indicating that climate change may lead to a substantially different hydrological regime in the Kalu Ganga catchment.

AB  - Jordan faces great internal water scarcity and pollution, conflict over trans-boundary waters, and strong dependency on external water resources through trade. This paper analyzes these issues and subsequently reviews options to reduce the risk of extreme water scarcity and dependency. Based on estimates of water footprint, water availability, and virtual water trade, we find that groundwater consumption is nearly double the groundwater availability, water pollution aggravates blue water scarcity, and Jordan's external virtual water import dependency is 86%. The review of response options yields 10 ingredients for a strategy for Jordan to mitigate the risks of extreme water scarcity and dependency. With respect to these ingredients, Jordan's current water policy requires a strong redirection towards water demand management. Actual implementation of the plans in the national water strategy (against existing oppositions) would be a first step. However, more attention should be paid to reducing water demand by changing the consumption pattern of Jordanian consumers. Moreover, unsustainable exploitation of the fossil Disi aquifer should soon be halted and planned desalination projects require careful consideration regarding the sustainability of their energy supply.

AB  - The question of which climate model bias correction methods and spatial scales for correction are optimal for both projecting future hydrological changes as well as removing initial model bias has so far received little attention. For 11 climate models (CMs), or GCM/RCM - Global/Regional Climate Model pairing, this paper analyses the relationship between complexity and robustness of three distribution-based scaling (DBS) bias correction methods applied to daily precipitation at various spatial scales. Hydrological simulations are forced by CM inputs to assess the spatial uncertainty of groundwater head and stream discharge given the various DBS methods. A unique metric is devised, which allows for comparison of spatial variability in climate model bias and projected change in precipitation. It is found that the spatial variability in climate model bias is larger than in the climate change signals. The magnitude of spatial bias seen in precipitation inputs does not necessarily correspond to the magnitude of biases seen in hydrological outputs. Variables that integrate basin responses over time and space are more sensitive to mean spatial biases and less so on extremes. Hydrological simulations forced by the least parameterized DBS approach show the highest error in mean and maximum groundwater heads; however, the most highly parameterised DBS approach shows less robustness in future periods compared with the reference period it was trained in. For hydrological impacts studies, choice of bias correction method should depend on the spatial scale at which hydrological impacts variables are required and whether CM initial bias is spatially uniform or spatially varying.

AB  - The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact (the Compact) was created to protect future water supplies and aquatic ecosystems in the Great Lakes. The Compact requires the eight Great Lakes state to regulate, among other things, large withdrawals of groundwater and surface water so that they do not negatively affect stream flows and ecosystems within the Great Lakes Basin. Thus, the Compact raises the possibility of increased restrictions on groundwater withdrawals in many locations throughout the Great Lakes region. However, restricting withdrawals is likely to encounter opposition from water users when such restrictions are viewed as an infringement on existing water use rights and/or as negatively impacting local economic development. Such conflicts could hinder effective implementation of state and regional water policy. This paper explores the application of a market-based environmental management tool called "Conservation Credit Offsets Trading (CCOT)" that could facilitate allocation of groundwater withdrawals, and develops a framework for guiding the implementation of CCOT within the context of a groundwater permitting system. Using a watershed in southwestern Michigan, this study demonstrates how bio-physical information and input from various local stakeholders were combined to aid groundwater policy designed to achieve the objective of no net (adverse) impact on stream ecosystems. By allowing flexibility through trading of conservation credit offsets, this groundwater policy tool appears to be more politically acceptable than traditional, less flexible, regulations. The results and discussion provide useful lessons learned with relevance to other areas in the Great Lakes Basin. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

AB  - Groundwater is the only water resource across the "hyper" arid Eastern Sahara. Management of this resource is imperative for the sustainable development approaches. A 3D GIS-based groundwater flow model for the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) was developed to simulate the groundwater management options for the different development areas/oases within the aquifer, and to predict the environmental impact of the present and future groundwater extraction schemes on the whole system. Based on the actual and planned extraction rates of the NSAS, five extraction scenarios were suggested to investigate the most feasible groundwater management option in terms of the economic lifting depth until year 2100. The model was calibrated and validated under the transient conditions. The calibrated model was then used for the prediction simulations. The results of simulating the present extraction rates of the NSAS until 2100 showed that the free flowing phenomenon will disappear all over the modeled area. At this simulation time, a groundwater volume of 354 km(3) will be extracted from the aquifer storage. Scenario 3 was found to be the optimal groundwater management option that meets the development ambitions and at the same time keeps the safe economic lifting depth as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - High elevation groundwater basins in the western United States are facing changes in the amount and timing of snowmelt due to climate change. The objective of this study is to examine seasonal variability in a high elevation aquifer (Maras Valley Watershed near Truckee, CA) by analyzing (1) tritium and helium isotopes to determine groundwater sources and age, (2) dissolved noble gases to determine recharge temperatures and excess air concentrations. Recharge temperatures calculated at pressures corresponding to well head elevations are similar to mean annual air temperatures at lower elevations of the watershed, suggesting that most recharge is occurring at these elevations, after equilibrating in the vadose zone. The groundwater flow depth required to increase the water temperature from the recharge temperature to the discharge temperature was calculated for each well assuming a typical geothermal gradient. Groundwater samples contain large amounts of excess helium from terrigenic sources, including mantle helium and radiogenic helium. Terrigenic helium and tritium concentrations are used to determine the amount of mixing between the younger and older groundwater sources. Many of the wells sampled show a mix of groundwater ages ranging from >1000s of years old to groundwater with tritium concentrations that are in agreement with tritium in modern day precipitation. Higher seasonal variability found in wells with younger groundwater and shallower flow depths indicates that the recent recharge most vulnerable to climate impacts helps to supplement the older, less sustainable waters in the aquifer during periods of increased production.

AB  - The ongoing transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy source provision has resulted in increased geothermal uses as Well as storage of the shallow subsurface. Existing approaches for exploration of shallow subsurface geothermal energy storage often lack the ability to provide information concerning the spatial variability of thermal storage parameters. However, parameter distributions have to be known to ensure that sustainable geothermal use of the shallow subsurface can take place especially when it is subject to intensive usage. In this paper, we test a temperature decay time approach to obtain in situ, direct, qualitative, spatial high-resolution information about the distribution of thermal storage capabilities of the shallow subsurface. To achieve this, temperature data from a high-resolution Fibre Optic-Distributed-Temperature-Sensing device, as well as data from conventional Pt-100-temperature-sensors were collected during a heat injection test. The latter test was used to measure the decay time of temperature signal dissipation of the subsurface. Signal generation was provided by in-aquifer heating with a temperature self-regulating electric heating cable. Heating was carried out for 4.5 days. After this, a cooling period of 1.5 weeks was observed. Temperature dissipation data was also compared to Direct Push-derived high-resolution (hydro-)geological data. The results show that besides hydraulic properties also the bedding and compaction state of the sediment have an impact on the thermal storage capability of the saturated subsurface. The temperature decay time approach is therefore a reliable method for obtaining information regarding the qualitative heat storage capability of heterogeneous aquifers for the use with closed loop system geothermal storage systems. Furthermore, this approach is advantageous over other commonly used methods, e.g. soil-sampling and laboratory analysis, as even small changes in (hydro-)geological properties lead to strong variances in observed heat-storage capabilities at the investigated case study site. By using fibre-optic-thermometers, nearly every requested spatial resolution can be achieved and easily be adjusted to the needs of actual test sites for shallow geothermal storage exploration.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how local promoters framed the development of the ethanol industry in Kansas, in the Midwestern U.S, by attaching it to locally salient discourses related to the environment, economic development, energy independence, and the cultural importance of agricultural production. We use a framing analysis to examine the discourse and cultural politics of the promotion of ethanol production in four regional and one state level newspaper, supplemented by data from key informant interviews conducted to understand how both the promises and the impacts of the ethanol industry are reframed at the local level. We argue that by linking ethanol production to localized economic and environmental benefits, and to national security and energy independence agendas, the discourse promoting biofuels development in the local media sidelined any discussion of climate mitigation or conservation agendas associated with biofuels production, and reframed natural resource issues to justify local claims for continued water mining for agricultural production. In particular, water use in biofuels production is naturalized as an entitlement for agriculture and ethanol producers. Our research adds to the rural studies literature that examines how powerful discourses and ideologies interact to advance an agenda that may actually be counter to economic and environmental futures in rural communities.

AB  - In recent years, many researchers have devoted their efforts to finding an objective measurement of sustainability by developing evaluation tools based on sustainability indices. These indexes not only reveal the current state of water resources in a given area but also contribute to the development and implementation of effective sustainable water management and decision-making. The great disadvantage of these indices is that for proper application, a number of variables are necessary and they are usually not available in data-scarce aquifers. This study was designed to evaluate sustainability in groundwater resource management in an aquifer in a semiarid zone, using readily available parameters and under a pressure-state-response framework. This methodology has been applied to an aquifer in Southeast Spain with satisfactory results, since the indicators that were evaluated reflect the two main problems that hinder sustainable resource management: the contamination of groundwater by intensive local farming; and the need for external inputs from other basins to alleviate water stress. Therefore, the methodology used can be replicated in other areas with similar characteristics to those of the case study.

AB  - Bouguer gravity anomaly mapped at a scale of 1:500,000 and the lithological logs of about 120 deep wells were used to determine the thickness of the sedimentary sequence containing the main sandstone water formation in important area of Egypt. The area is located in the southern part of the Western Desert bounded by the latitudes 22 degrees 00'-26 degrees 30' N, and longitudes 28 degrees 30'-33 degrees 00' E. The predominant structures affecting the basement rocks and the sedimentary cover were also studied. The gravity stripping approach was applied to eliminate the gravity effects caused by sedimentary sequence and to separate density anomalies within the sedimentary fill from the influence of rocks at deeper levels in the crystalline crust. The present study indicated that the surface of the basement rocks is highly rugged and mostly controlled by structures which have a direct effect on thickness variation of the sedimentary cover all over the area. Regionally the area is characterized by two major intracratonic basins (the Dahkla Basin and the Nile valley Basin) separated by a NE-SW trending swell of the Kharga uplift and bounded at the south by the Oweinat-Bir Safsaf-Aswan uplift. These major tectonic units are controlled by fault structures trending in N-S, E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE, which cut the basement rocks and extend upward in the sedimentary cover. The maximum thickness of sandstone formations is recorded at west Oweinat, west Kurkur, southwest of Aswan, Gramashin. Dakhla oasis and some localities west of Sohag and Qena towns. At these localities the thickness ranges between 600 and 900 m. As this formation is the main water aquifer in the study area, therefore these localities are characterized by the presence of big amount of groundwater. Accordingly, these areas must take the priority in the sustainable development programs of southern Egypt. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study reports an assessment of the water budget of the Crau aquifer (Southern France), which is poorly referenced in the literature. Anthropogenically controlled by a traditional irrigation practice, this alluvial type aquifer requires a robust quantification of the groundwater mass balance in order to establish sustainable water management in the region. In view of the high isotopic contrast between exogenous irrigation waters and local precipitations, stable isotopes of water can be used as conservative tracers to deduce their contributions to the surface recharge. Extensive groundwater sampling was performed to obtain delta 18O and delta 2H over the whole aquifer. Based on a new piezometric contour map, combined with an updated aquifer geometry, the isotopic data were implemented in a geostatistical approach to produce a conceptual equivalent homogeneous reservoir. This makes it possible to implement a parsimonious water and isotope mass-balance mixing model. The isotopic compositions of the two end-members were assessed, and the quantification of groundwater flows was then used to calculate the two recharge fluxes (natural and irrigation). Nearly at steady-state, the set of isotopic data treated by geostatistics gave a recharge by irrigation of 4.92 +/- 0.89 m(3) s(-1), i.e. 1109 +/- 202 mm yr(-1), and a natural recharge of 2.19 +/- 0.85 m(3) s(-1), i.e. 128 +/- 50 mm yr(-1). Thus, 69 +/- 9% of the surface recharge is caused by irrigation return flow. This study constitutes a straightforward and independent approach to assess groundwater surface recharges including uncertainties and will help to constrain future transient groundwater models of the Crau aquifer.

AB  - In 1998, South Africa promulgated a Water Act that is widely regarded as one of the most progressive and enabling pieces of environmental legislation in the world. The environmental aspects of the Water Act are commonly referred to as "resource-directed measures." These measures attempt to find the right balance between (1) leaving water in the resource ("nonconsumptive use") to provide ecological goods and services for society and (2) taking the water out of the system for "consumptive" human use. These measures also attempt to ensure that both nonconsumptive and consumptive use is sustainable. This article discusses some of the challenges faced in using the measures to achieve environmentally sustainable ground water use. A major challenge is that misunderstanding still abounds regarding the environmental aims of this legislation. Other major challenges identified included a severe shortage of technical capacity, an inordinately long water use license application process, incorporating adaptive management to deal with uncertainty, incorporating the public participation process, and revising policy implementation processes to accommodate highly localized aquifers. Selecting appropriate scientific methodology-neither too simplistic nor too involved-is a recurring challenge. It is suggested that an important part of addressing these and the other challenges identified is a period of reflection and dialogue between the various sectors involved.

AB  - Backcasting defines a vision of a desirable future and then analyzes the actions required to realize that vision. This article uses backcasting to explore ways to improve the national government's contribution to good groundwater governance in South Africa. Using the South African Department of Water and Sanitation as a case study, it is found that lack of strategic thinking and implementation are the main impediments to service delivery. Although isolated cases of groundwater 'overuse' and pollution can be found in South Africa, the main governance issues are currently competition between users for groundwater use, and inordinate delays in granting authorization for that use.

AB  - Prolonged absence of groundwater within the operating range of shallow tube-wells during dry season is a common problem in the northwestern districts of Bangladesh in the recent years. In this paper, groundwater scarcity and drought in three northwestern districts of Bangladesh have been investigated. The Cumulative Deficit approach from a threshold groundwater level has been used for the computation of severity of groundwater droughts. Monthly groundwater fluctuation data collected from 85 sites is used for the study. The study shows that groundwater scarcity in 42% area is an every year phenomenon in the region. Analysis of groundwater hydrographs and rainfall time-series reveals that ever increasing groundwater extraction for irrigation in the dry season and recurrent droughts are the causes of groundwater level drop in the region.

AB  - Groundwater demand in northwestern districts of Bangladesh is increasing rapidly with the growth of population and the expansion of irrigated agriculture. Development and management of groundwater resources are essential to supply the growing population with sufficient water for economic development as well as for the sustainable environment of the region. In the present study, groundwater recharge-abstraction balance method has been used for the spatial assessment of groundwater development potential. The abstraction of groundwater is estimated from irrigation and domestic water demands in the study area. The net recharge calculated from groundwater table fluctuation data, whereas the abstraction of groundwater is estimated from irrigation and domestic water demands in the study area. The study shows that out of twenty-six sub-districts, groundwater exploitation has reached to a critical condition in fourteen sub-districts. Development of surface water resources and water conservation are essential to reduce the stress on groundwater exploitation.

AB  - Riverbank filtration (RBF) is an efficient and low-cost natural alternative technology for water supply application in which surface water contaminants are removed or degraded as the infiltrating water moves from the river/lake to the pumping wells. The removal or degradation of contaminants is a combination of physicochemical and biological processes. For more than 100 years, RBF has been used in Europe for public and industrial water supply along Rhine, Elbe, and Danube rivers. This paper presents an investigation of a full-scale RBF plant located in Upper Egypt as section of Nile valley to produce drinking water. The studied plant is constructed in 2004 to supply potable water for Sidfa city (30,000 residents), Assiut Governorate. It consists of 6 vertical wells, each about 60 m deep, with distance about 30 m from the west bank of Nile. Water samples from Nile as induced surface water, from background groundwater, and from production wellfield were collected and analyzed at three discrete events. Quality measurements of physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics were obtained. Comparison of produced water with surface and background natural groundwater for the investigated plant has proven the effectiveness of RBF technique for potable water supply in Upper Egypt. Physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the produced water are better than the allowable standards for drinking purposes. The results prove the implementation of RBF treatment method for water supply in Nile valley.

AB  - An accurate estimation of groundwater recharge is required to properly manage aquifers, especially for riverbank filtration method (RBF) purposes. The isotopes correlations and differences in different water bodies were studied to assess the sources of groundwater recharge and preliminary tools in understanding of the surface water and groundwater interactions in the Lower Muda River Basin. The environmental isotope and hydrochemical sampling results had emphasised that the area near Lower Muda River Basin had a connection with the river and was actively recharging the near-river shallow alluvial aquifer, via RBF method. Furthermore, the shallow groundwater that was close to Muda River from groundwater signatures had indicated the recharge of the shallow aquifer system by Muda River based on the plots along LMWL on a delta H-2 versus delta O-18. The comparisons between like delta H-2 and delta O-18 isotopes in the rainwater revealed the variations in the rainfall amount and the O-18-depleted water of those isotopes for wet season precipitation as compared to dry seasons. Furthermore, the groundwater delta H-2 and delta O-18 isotopes exhibited a slight deviation from the delta H-2 and delta O-18 isotopic meteoric water line in Lower Muda River. Therefore, in this basin, the groundwater could be a combination of river water and precipitation, which had led to the recharge of river water being more than the recharge of rainfall infiltration.

AB  - Quantitative evaluations of the impact of groundwater abstraction on recharge are rare. Over a period (1975-2007) during which groundwater abstraction increased dramatically in the Bengal Basin, changes in net groundwater recharge in Bangladesh are assessed using the water-table fluctuation method. Mean annual groundwater recharge is shown to be higher (300-600 mm) in northwestern and southwestern areas of Bangladesh than in southeastern and northeastern regions (< 100 mm) where rainfall and potential recharge are greater. Net recharge in many parts of Bangladesh has increased substantially (5-15 mm/year between 1985 and 2007) in response to increased groundwater abstraction for irrigation and urban water supplies. In contrast, net recharge has slightly decreased (-0.5 to -1 mm/year) in areas where groundwater-fed irrigation is low (< 30% of total irrigation) and where abstraction has either decreased or remained unchanged over the period of 1985-2007. The spatio-temporal dynamics of recharge in Bangladesh illustrate the fundamental flaw in definitions of "safe yield" based on recharge estimated under static (non-pumping) conditions and reveal the areas where (1) further groundwater abstraction may increase actual recharge to the shallow aquifer, and (2) current groundwater abstraction for irrigation and urban water supplies is unsustainable.

AB  - Scarcity of groundwater necessitates the present study to evaluate groundwater potential and quality for designing suitable water management plans in the Bhatsa and Kalu river basins in the Thane district in the western Deccan volcanic province of India. A Geographical Information System platform is used to integrate and spatially analyse multiparametric data comprised of satellite, topographical, geological and hydrogeological information to generate several thematic maps, including groundwater potential zonation map. This study reveals that 70% of the area has medium to low groundwater potential, while only 10% has high potential. The static and dynamic groundwater potentials are estimated to be 10.7 and 4.8% of the annual rainfall. The groundwater quality in terms of hardness, total dissolved solids, salinity and chloride is suitable for domestic and irrigational purposes. A database is developed for sustainable water management program for the region and areas where suitable water conservation techniques need to be adopted are identified.

AB  - We examined the variation of stygofauna composition collected in wells, along a gradient in groundwater salinity/conductivity in a coastal aquifer from southern Portugal. The studied coastal aquifer is considered vulnerable to salinization due to seawater intrusion, caused by overexploitation of the aquifer. Knowing the response of the stygofauna species to present levels of groundwater salinity makes it possible to understand and measure the effects of saltwater intrusion on stygofauna, rendering them potential bioindicators of this environmental pressure. Biotic and abiotic sampling was conducted in six shallow wells located in the fresh-saltwater interface of the Arade estuary along the salinity gradient established in the groundwater from the estuary to inland locations (microSiemens/cm). Groundwater salinity was highly correlated with taxa distribution. The stygobites Eucyclops hadjebensis and Acanthocyclops sensitivus, the cosmopolitan Megacyclops viridis and Cypria ophtalmica were particularly associated with low-salinity conditions, whereas Eucyclops graeteri, Megacyclops brachypus and Daphnia pulicaria were related to high-salinity waters. Multivariate analyses indicated that stygofauna assemblages varied significantly with location. We suggest that stygofauna composition and structure can be a useful complementing tool for monitoring seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers, where reduction or deterioration in groundwater resources is predicted.

AB  - Recharge is a critical issue for water management. Recharge assessment and the factors affecting recharge are of scientific and practical importance. The purpose of this study was to develop a daily recharge assessment model (DREAM) on the basis of a water balance principle with input from conventional and generally available precipitation and evaporation data and demonstrate the application of this model to recharge estimation in the Western Mountain Aquifer (WMA) in Israel. The WMA (area 13,000 km(2)) is a karst aquifer that supplies 360-400 Mm(3) yr(-1) of freshwater, which constitutes 20% of Israel's freshwater and is highly vulnerable to climate variability and change. DREAM was linked to a groundwater flow model (FEFLOW) to simulate monthly hydraulic heads and spring flows. The models were calibrated for 1987-2002 and validated for 2003-2007, yielding high agreement between calculated and measured values (R(2) = 0.95; relative root-mean-square error = 4.8%; relative bias = 1.04). DREAM allows insights into the effect of intra-annual precipitation distribution factors on recharge. Although annual precipitation amount explains similar to 70% of the variability in simulated recharge, analyses with DREAM indicate that the rainy season length is an important factor controlling recharge. Years with similar annual precipitation produce different recharge values as a result of temporal distribution throughout the rainy season. An experiment with a synthetic data set exhibits similar results, explaining similar to 90% of the recharge variability. DREAM represents significant improvement over previous recharge estimation techniques in this region by providing near-real-time recharge estimates that can be used to predict the impact of climate variability on groundwater resources at high temporal and spatial resolution.

AB  - Water resources management (WRM) for sustainable development presents many challenges in areas with sparse in situ monitoring networks. The exponential growth of satellite based information over the past decade provides unprecedented opportunities to support and improve WRM. Furthermore, traditional barriers to the access and usage of satellite data are lowering as technological innovations provide opportunities to manage and deliver this wealth of information to a wider audience. We review data needs for WRM and the role that satellite remote sensing can play to fill gaps and enhance WRM, focusing on the Latin American and Caribbean as an example of a region with potential to further develop its resources and mitigate the impacts of hydrological hazards. We review the state-of-the-art for relevant variables, current satellite missions, and products, how they are being used currently by national agencies across the Latin American and Caribbean region, and the challenges to improving their utility. We discuss the potential of recently launched, upcoming, and proposed missions that are likely to further enhance and transform assessment and monitoring of water resources. Ongoing challenges of accuracy, sampling, and continuity still need to be addressed, and further challenges related to the massive amounts of new data need to be overcome to best leverage the utility of satellite based information for improving WRM.

AB  - Plant water use characteristics and transpiration responses under dry conditions are considered essential for effective and sustainable ecosystem management in arid areas. This study was conducted to evaluate the response of shelterbelt stand transpiration to precipitation, soil drought and groundwater variations in an oasis-desert ecotone in the middle of the Heihe River Basin, China. Sap flow was measured in eight Gansu Poplar trees (Populus Gansuensis) with different diameter at breast height over three consecutive growing seasons (2012-2014). The groundwater evapotranspiration via plant use was estimated by the White method with diurnal water table fluctuations. The results showed that precipitation increased the stand transpiration but not statistically significant (paired t-test, p > 0.05). The recharge of soil water by irrigation caused stand transpiration acceleration significantly (t-test, p < 0.05). Stand transpiration and canopy conductance increased by 27% and 31%, respectively, when soil water conditions changed from dry to wet. Canopy conductance decreased logarithmically with vapor pressure deficit, while there was no apparent relationship between canopy conductance and solar radiation. The sensitivity of canopy conductance to vapor pressure deficit decreased under dry soil conditions. Groundwater evapotranspiration (0.6-7.1 mm day(-1)) was linearly correlated with stand transpiration (1.1-6.5 mm day(-1)) (R-2 = 0.71), and these two variables had similar variability. During the drought period, approximately 80% of total stand transpiration came from groundwater evapotranspiration. This study highlighted the critical role of irrigation and groundwater for shelterbelt, and might provide the basis for the development of water requirement schemes for shelterbelt growth in arid inland river basins.

AB  - Groundwater is a critical resource for sustainable economic growth in an arid and semi-arid region such as the Rio Grande Basin because it provides water for municipal, industrial, and domestic, and agricultural users. The water is also important for the health of riparian ecosystems in the Rio Grande basin. Historic groundwater pumping has resulted in large groundwater level drawdown, water quality deterioration, depletion of surface water and subsidence in El Paso/Ciudad Juarez area, which in turn will limit groundwater availability in the future. Therefore, securing future groundwater availability involves a multi-spectrum of efforts, including minimizing net losses from the underground reservoir, managing groundwater as an integrated part of the hydrologic cycle, developing infrastructure based on an understanding of the natural hydrologic system, using water wisely and efficiently, and allocating and monitoring water fairly for human as well as environmental and ecological needs. This paper focuses on the current status of groundwater quantity and geochemistry-groundwater hydrology, key aquifers, water quantity and chemistry, impacts of groundwater pumping and climate variability on groundwater availability within the Rio Grande Basin along river reaches between Elephant Butte Dam and Amistad Dam. This paper is part of a larger effort to summarize the state of the science relative to water sustainability in the region. This information can be used to plan research and education agendas aimed at water sustainability under climate and social changes. Current water uses and estimates of groundwater availability are summarized for the selected regional aquifers that underlie or are located adjacent to the Rio Grande. Several research topics are identified and recommended in terms of gaining better understanding of groundwater availability and impacts of future groundwater pumping and climate variability on the regional aquifer systems.

AB  - The primary goal of this work was to identify the sustainable groundwater yield which is a key reference of reasonable groundwater development, but also a complex issue in current hydrogeologic science. One major limit to identify sustainable groundwater yield is the lack of a unified evaluation criterion because there are many factors involved in hydrological systems that are difficult to quantify. To address this problem, an integrated evaluation model was constructed for a series of purposes including the maximal efficiency of water use, the integral benefit of development and utilization, the optimized environmental water demand and the minimal anthropogenic influence on groundwater system. It consists of a benefit model, a water cycling simulation model and an optimization model. The basin-wide model for water cycling simulation was a basic component to simulate scenarios with different constraints, and the best water development strategy was thereafter identified using the integral benefit model of water resources development. The Yinma River basin in a Chinese semi-humid region was selected as the case study area. Results indicated the optimized groundwater yield could be sustained by intensive reservoir supply and maintain suitable ecological water demand simultaneously. The work proposed a potential groundwater utilization strategy for economically developing countries across the world. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - High level of groundwater in urban areas may cause major problems in construction and mining projects. One effective solution is to implement drainage wells to lower the water table into the desired level through an appropriate pumping strategy. In this paper, placement and capacity of the dewatering wells are optimized by minimizing the total costs of a groundwater lowering system (GLS) through a simulation-optimization approach. For this purpose, MODFLOW, the groundwater simulation software, is coupled with the Firefly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) to find the optimal solution. The proposed FOA-MODFLOW model is tested in an urban area in east southern part of Iran, Kerman city's ancient Mosque region. Results show that the obtained cost-effective design noticeably outperforms the consulting engineers' proposal in terms of both the number of drilled wells and the associated costs with justifiable constraints. Optimal strategy satisfies the constraints by suggesting construction of two wells with totally pumping rate of 5503 m(3)/day while the water table is dropped 1.5 m with a ground subsidence less than 80 mm in the region. Additionally, an investigation on the value of various design parameters emphasizes on the sensitivity of the solutions to the permissible groundwater level and the well's maximum pumping rates among the others.

AB  - A highly modular and scale-consistent Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP) is presented. The modeling platform consists of an atmospheric model (Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling; COSMO), a land surface model (the NCAR Community Land Model, version 3.5; CLM3.5), and a 3D variably saturated groundwater flow model (ParFlow). An external coupler (Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil, version 3.0; OASIS3) with multiple executable approaches is employed to couple the three independently developed component models, which intrinsically allows for a separation of temporal spatial modeling scales and the coupling frequencies between the component models. Idealized TerrSysMiP simulations are presented, which focus on the interaction of key hydrologic processes, like runoff production (excess rainfall and saturation) at different hydrological modeling scales and the drawdown of the water table through groundwater pumping, with processes in the atmospheric boundary layer. The results show a strong linkage between integrated surface groundwater dynamics, biogeophysical processes, and boundary layer evolution. The use of the mosaic approach for the hydrological component model (to resolve subgrid-scale topography) impacts simulated runoff production, soil moisture redistribution, and boundary layer evolution, which demonstrates the importance of hydrological modeling scales and thus the advantages of the coupling approach used in this study. Real data simulations were carried out with TerrSysMP over the Rur catchment in Germany. The inclusion of the integrated surface groundwater flow model results in systematic patterns in the root zone soil moisture, which influence exchange flux distributions and the ensuing atmospheric boundary layer development. In a first comparison to observations, the 3D model compared to the 1D model shows slightly improved predictions of surface fluxes and a strong sensitivity to the initial soil moisture content.

AB  - An area of rainforest in Trinidad (10 degrees N, 61 degrees W) is remarkably rich in biodiversity, and receives the highest amount of rainfall in the island due to its orography and the dominant northeast trade winds. However, a year-round transfer of water from its pristine rivers is likely in the future, with ecological consequences. The results of a pilot study are presented, based on a simple, and graphical, segment-scale multi-objective methodology for the estimation of the optimal instream flow of the 13 rivers in this area. This methodology is based on a dimensionless ecohydrological factor, A, which enables the required hydraulic mean depth at a river cross-section to be expressed in terms of the average species length at maturity for a target group of amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles. Moreover, the methodology considers the socio-economic cost of ecological degradation brought about by streamflow abstraction, as well as the economic benefit of the same. An example illustrates the estimation of optimal instream flow for a value of A and, thereby, the corresponding optimal river intake operating rule, based on the hydraulic characteristics of a 0.1 km segment of one of the rivers, for the 20-year average dry (January-May) and wet (June-December) seasons. The limitations of the pilot study, and areas for further research, are also highlighted with a hope that it will ultimately evolve into a decision-making tool for water resources management.

AB  - The integrated hydrological model MIKE SHE was applied to a part of the North China Plain to examine the dynamics of the hydrological system and to assess water management options to restore depleted groundwater resources. The model simulates the spatio-temporal distribution of recharge to and the associated dynamics of the alluvial aquifers based on climatic conditions, land use, soil characteristics, irrigation and coupled unsaturated-saturated zone processes. The model was auto-calibrated for the period 1996-2002 against daily observations of groundwater head from wells distributed across the 7230 km(2) region and actual evapotranspiration measured at an agricultural station located within the model area. The model simulations compared well with observations and acceptable values were obtained for both root mean square error and correlation coefficient. The calibrated model was subsequently used for scenario analysis of the effect of different cropping rotations, irrigation intensity, and other water management options, like the implementation of the South to North Water Transfer (SNWT) project. The model analysis verified that groundwater tables in the region are subject to steep declines (up to 1 m/yr) due to decades of intensive exploitation of the groundwater resources for crop irrigation, primarily the widespread crop rotation of irrigated winter wheat and mostly rainfed summer maize. The SNWT project mitigates water stress in Shijiazhuang city and areas adjacent to wastewater canals but cannot solely reverse declining water tables across the region. Combining the SNWT project and implementing region-wide crop and irrigation system changes, including deficit irrigation, wastewater irrigation, and alternating winter fallow, provides a feasible means to stabilize groundwater levels in the area.

AB  - Understanding the effects of major hydrogeological controls on hyporheic exchange and bank storage is essential for river water management, groundwater abstraction, restoration and ecosystem sustainability. Analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundary conditions, varying geometry of surface water-groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. To understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) bank storage, (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2-D hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. The numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower-regulated Lule River, northern Sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long-lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. Modelling results revealed that bank storage increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. When a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river-aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected bank storage. The presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity < 0.001 m d(-1) significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated bank storage. The bank storage return/fill time ratio was positively related to wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. Discharge oscillations with short duration and small amplitude decreased bank storage and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish-spawning locations. Based on these results, river regulation strategies can be improved by considering the effect of certain wave event configurations on hyporheic exchange to ensure harmonious hydrogeochemical functioning of the river-aquifer interfaces and related ecosystems.

AB  - The Australian cotton industry and governments have funded research into the deep-drainage component of the soil-water balance for several decades. Cotton is dominantly grown in the northern Murray-Darling and Fitzroy Basins, using furrow irrigation on cracking clays. Previously, it was held that furrow irrigation on cracking clays was inherently efficient and there was little deep drainage. This has been shown to be simplistic and generally incorrect. This paper reviews global and northern Australian deep-drainage studies in irrigation, generally at point- or paddock-scale, and the consequences of deep drainage. For furrow-irrigated fields in Australia, key findings are as follows. (i) Deep drainage varies considerably depending on soil properties and irrigation management, and is not necessarily very small'. Historically, values of 100-250mm year(-1) were typical, with 3-900mm year(-1) observed, until water shortage in the 2000s and continued research and extension focussed attention on water-use efficiency (WUE). (ii) More recently, values of 50-100mm year(-1) have been observed, with no deep drainage in drier years; these levels are lower than global values. (iii) Optimisation (flow rate, field length, cut-off time) of furrow irrigation can at least halve deep drainage. (iv) Cotton is grown on soils with a wide range in texture, sodicity and structure. (v) Deep drainage is moderately to strongly related to total rainfall plus irrigation, as it is globally. (vi) A leaching fraction, to avoid salt build-up in the soil profile, is only needed for irrigation where more saline water is used. Drainage from rainfall often provides an adequate leaching fraction. (vii) Near-saturated conditions occur for at least 2-6m under irrigated fields, whereas profiles are dry under native vegetation in the same landscapes. (viii) Deep drainage leachate is typically saline and not a source of good quality groundwater recharge. Large losses of nitrate also occur in deep drainage. The consequences of deep drainage for groundwater and salinity are different where underlying groundwater can be used for pumping (fresh water, high yield; e.g. Condamine alluvia) and where it cannot (saline water or low yield; e.g. Border Rivers alluvia). Continuing improvements in WUE are needed to ensure long-term sustainability of irrigated cropping industries. Globally there is great potential for increased production using existing water supplies, given deep drainage of 10-25% of water delivered to fields and WUE of <50%. Future research priorities are to further characterise water movement through the unsaturated zone and the consequences of deep drainage.

AB  - Communities located in the interface between marine/brackish and freshwater habitats are likely to be early responders to climatic changes as they are exposed to both saline and freshwater conditions, and thus are expected to be sensitive to any change in their environmental conditions. Climatic effects are predicted to reduce the availability of groundwater, altering the hydrological balance on estuarine-aquifer interfaces. Here, we aimed to characterise the estuarine faunal community along a gradient dependent on groundwater input, under a predicted climatic scenario of reduction in groundwater discharge into the estuary. Sediment macrofauna was sampled along a salinity gradient following both the wet and dry seasons in 2009. Results indicated that species abundance varied significantly with the salinity gradient created by the groundwater discharge into the estuarine habitat and with sampling time. The isopode Cyarhura carinata (Kroyer, 1847) and the polychaetes Heteromastus filiformis (Claparede, 1864) and Hediste diversicolor O.F. Muller, 1776 were associated with the more saline locations, while oligochaeta and Spionidae were more abundant in areas of lower salinity. The polychaete Alkmaria romijni Horst, 1919 was the dominant species and ubiquitous throughout sampling stations. This study provides evidence for estuarine fauna to be considered as a potentially valuable indicator of variation in the input of groundwater into marine-freshwater interface habitats, expected from climatic pressures on aquifer levels, condition and recharge rates. For instance, a reduction in the abundance of some polychaete species, found here to be more abundant in freshwater conditions, and increasing Oligochaeta found here on higher salinities, can potentially be early warnings of a reduction in the input of groundwater into estuaries. Estuarine benthic species are often the main prey for commercially important fish predators such as in our case study, making it important to monitor the aquatic habitat interfaces taking into consideration the estuarine macrobenthos and groundwater availability in the system.

AB  - Intercepted saline groundwaters and drainage effluent from irrigation are commonly stored in both natural and artificial saline disposal basins throughout the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. Their continued use as wastewater evaporation sites requires an understanding of existing groundwater dynamics. The useful lifetimes of individual basins, their sustainability and possible environmental impacts remain largely unknown. In this work, the movement of salt to the underlying groundwater system from Lake Tutchewop, a saline disposal complex in north-central Victoria, was modelled in cross-section. Due to the salinity contrast between the hypersaline basin waters and the regional groundwater, it was necessary to simulate density dependent flow behaviour. Under certain conditions, these density-stratified systems may become unstable leading to the onset of convective behaviour, which greatly increases the movement of salt from the basin to the groundwater system. Modelled concentration profiles in the aquifer system and calculated seepage rates from the basin show that Lake Tutchewop is stable under its present operating regime. The downward movement of salt is mainly controlled by diffusion and dispersion. The calibrated model was used to assess the impact of several management scenarios using time-dependent boundary conditions for lake salinity and water levels. The influence of heterogeneous basin linings on ensuing salt flux rates is examined, and results show that increased solute transport will occur under such conditions. A sensitivity analysis performed on governing variables showed that salt fluxes were most sensitive to lake salinity levels. A solute Rayleigh number defined in terms of basin salinity and hydrogeologic parameters is seen to be an effective tool for predicting the long term behaviour of such saline disposal basins. The models and concepts developed in this work may find application in the design and management of saline disposal complexes. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper provides an account of the environmental history of a landlocked coastal wetland and the surrounding nature space (Lake Claremont) located within a large Australian city (Perth, Western Australia). We document the processes and behaviour that led to significant negative change over time and report on recent work to restore the lake and its surrounding ecosystem. The reported community-initiated actions reflect changing human values and add to the accumulating evidence that the increasing trend of restoring greenspace to native ecosystems (nature space) brings about social and conservation benefits within the urban fabric. Moreover, this narrative also indicates that significant progress can be made in recovering and expanding ecological components and natural values within a relatively short period. Implications for city planners and land managers are self-evident with regard to what can be achieved and the values that communities now place on naturally functioning urban wetlands. Furthermore, the presence of wetlands such as Lake Claremont in the urban fabric is seen to enhance the liveability of the surrounding city by offering a convenient way for residents and tourists to connect with nature and the outdoors and realise the health benefits that the lake can provide. This case study adds to the body of work that identifies and describes the growing importance of urban wetlands in urban landscapes and provides a clear example of what can be achieved at the local community level and with local government support.

AB  - In this study, a new, GIS-based solid waste site selection tool (DUPIT) is introduced to obtain a systematic and unbiased methodology during the evaluation phases of alternative solid waste disposal areas with regards to vulnerability to groundwater pollution. The proposed tool is an index technique based on the linear combination of five different hydrogeological parameters including Depth to groundwater table, Upper layer lithology, Permeability of the unsaturated zone, Impermeable layer thickness and Topographic slope. Five different categories are developed to classify each alternative based on the suitability of the site for a solid waste disposal area. As a result, each site is ranked according to the contamination risks for groundwater resources. The proposed technique is applied to the District of Torbali near Izmir, Turkey to determine the most appropriate solid waste disposal site location. The Torbali application is implemented by using a GIS database developed for the area. Based on the results of this application, the best alternative solid waste disposal site for Torbali is selected to be located in the northern portions of the city where the groundwater table is deep, the permeability is low and the topographic slope is mild.

AB  - The long-term success of irrigated agriculture for sustainable crop production in India depends largely on the careful management of land and water resources. Currently, some serious environmental problems of waterlogging and soil salinization are burgeoning in parts of Haryana State of India: half a million hectare area of the State is already waterlogged. Poor irrigation and drainage management and inadequate exploitation of saline ground water are the main factors responsible for this phenomenon. In order to prevent further degradation and to maintain the food production for the growing population, judicious use of natural resources is a must. A wide range of solutions could be considered to address the problems. But the effectiveness of all the solutions and their combinations cannot be verified with on-farm experiments. Simulation models by way of their predictive capability are often the only viable means of providing input to management decisions. These models can help to forecast the likely impacts of a particular alternative management strategy. In the present study a physical based one-dimensional simulation model SWASALT was employed to evaluate on-farm irrigation water management options. After successful calibration and validation with field experimentation data, several scenario building exercises have been conducted under different crop, soil and rainfall conditions. The water and salt balance component obtained for each simulation run were used to derive water management response indicators. The simulation study revealed that in most conditions, saline water of up to 7.5 dS/m can be used safely on long term basis for crop production. The simulation study further revealed that alternative use of canal and saline water had an edge over mix use. Several alternatives have been suggested for sustainable agricultural production in the region. The strategies suggested, if followed, would lend sustainability to the agricultural production besides substantial increase in production and water resources conservation, by impeding the environmental hazard of waterlogging and soil salinization.

AB  - Accurate estimation of the groundwater recharge is essential for efficient and sustainable groundwater management in arid and semi-arid regions, as water resources are critical to economic development in these areas. Various techniques are available to quantify recharge. The hydrological budget model proposed herein is unique, simple, and easy to apply. It uses data on groundwater level, groundwater extraction. and distributed specific yield information for estimating groundwater recharge. The Model is employed to estimate the seasonal long-term (35 years, e.g., from 1974 to 2009) groundwater recharge of an irrigated semi-arid area located in Haryana State of India, where groundwater levels are rising, continuously. The results are analysed to provide an overview of the process dynamics that led to imbalance of the system. Groundwater recharge analysis during the study period reveals that percolation from irrigated fields is the main recharge component with 49% contribution to the total recharge. An annual groundwater table rise of 0.14 m has been estimated for the study area. Various potential solution alternatives are evaluated to mitigate the problems of waterlogging and salinisation, considering the socioeconomic issues which have wider policy significance on sustainability. Several suitable water management strategies such as reduction in rice area, increase in pumping volume and using the groundwater conjunctively with higher quality canal water, and lining of canal networks are suggested to bring the watertable down to a safe limit and to prevent further rising of the watertable. Among the potential solution alternatives studied, the one which considers 10% reduction in rice area along with 2% increase in pumping volume and 20% canal lining, yields best result for mitigating the waterlogging problems.

AB  - Rise in groundwater level followed by waterlogging and secondary salinisation has become a serious problem in canal irrigated areas located in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. To solve the problem, the groundwater model SGMP was applied in a waterlogged area of Haryana State of India in which about 500,000 ha has already waterlogged resulting in reduced crop yield and abandonment of agricultural lands. After successful calibration and validation, several scenario building exercises have been conducted. Error and sensitivity analyses of the model parameters were done. The impact of potential policy changes on the groundwater levels has been analysed through the model. The alternative scenarios revealed that small increase in the net recharge would cause the waterlogging problem to aggravate. On the other hand, if net recharge decreases, the situation would turn favorable. The study also revealed that by reducing the recharge in the range of 5-20% from the average values, the watertable could be stabilized at a safe depth. To prevent the area from further salinisation some recommendations can be given such as; increase in groundwater abstraction, water distribution as per water requirements of crops, and the lining of surface irrigation systems. Thus it is apparent that the SGMP model seems to be an effective tool for groundwater simulation. It has the potential of assessing the watertable behaviour due to various interventions. The results of simulation studies of existing and proposed water management policy, therefore, may form the basis for the identification of appropriate water management plans for the future.

The conjunctive use allows the utilization of poor quality water, which cannot be used as such for the crop production due to its harmful effect on soil and crop health. This paper presents an overview on issues and methods of the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources for sustainable irrigated agriculture. The background of the conjunctive water use and its applications for the management of poor quality water and management of rising watertable are presented. The management of conjunctive water use through the computer-based models is also covered in this review. The advantages and disadvantages of the approach have been described.

AB  - The world population is increasing continuously and is expected to reach the 9.5billion mark in 2050 from the current 7.1billion. The importance of the groundwater resources is also increasing with the increase in population, because the quality and quantity of water resources are continuously declining because of urbanization, contamination, and climate change impact. Thus, under the current environment, the conservation and management of groundwater resources is a critical challenge for fulfilling the rising water demand for agricultural, industrial, and domestic uses. Various simulation and optimization approaches have been used to solve the groundwater management problems. Optimization methods have proved to be of great importance when used with simulation models, and the combined use of these two approaches gives the best results. The main objective of this review is to analyze combined uses of simulation and optimization modeling approaches and to provide an impression of their applications reported in literature. In addition to traditional optimization techniques, this paper highlights the application of computational intelligence techniques, such as artificial neural networks, response matrix approach, and multiobjective approach. Conclusions are drawn based on this review, which could be useful for system managers and planners for selecting the best suitable technique for their specific uses.

AB  - The seawater intrusion is a widespread environmental problem of coastal aquifers where more than two third of the world's population lives. The indiscriminate and unplanned groundwater withdrawal for fulfilling the growing freshwater needs of coastal regions causes this problem. Computer-based models are useful tools for achieving the optimal solution of seawater intrusion management problems. Various simulation and optimization modeling approaches have been used to solve the problems. Optimization approaches have been shown to be of great importance when combined with simulation models. A review on the combined applications of simulation and optimization modeling for the seawater intrusion management of the coastal aquifers are done and is presented in this paper. The reviews revealed that the simulation-optimization modeling approach is very suitable for achieving an optimal solution of seawater intrusion management problems even with a large number of variables. It is recommended that the future research should be directed toward improving the long-term hydraulic assessment by collecting and analyzing widespread spatial data, which can be done by increasing the observation and monitoring networks. The coupling of socioeconomic aspects in the seawater intrusion modeling would be another aspect which could be included in the future studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of irrigated agriculture is necessary for fulfilling the rising food requirements of the burgeoning global population. However, the intensification of irrigated agriculture causes the twin menace of waterlogging and soil salinization in arid and semiarid regions where more than 75% of the world's population lives. These problems can be managed by either adopting preventive measures which decrease the inflow of water and salt or by employing remedial measures which increase the outflow. This paper presents an overview of various measures used for the management of waterlogging and salinity problems. The background, processes involved, and severity of waterlogging and salinity problems are provided. The role of drainage systems, conjunctive use of different water sources, use of computer-based mathematical models, and the use of remote sensing and GIS techniques in managing the problems are discussed. Conclusions are provided which could be useful for all the stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In rapidly developing urban areas of emerging countries, increased water demand has led to enormous groundwater withdrawal, calling out for sustainable groundwater management. We suggest implementing a sustainable pumping rate concept based on numerical modeling of the managed aquifer. Sustainability is achieved by constraints regarding (1) a minimum groundwater discharge rate to gaining rivers (ecological constraint) and (2) a maximum drawdown along the city boundaries (social constraints) to prevent excessive groundwater depletion in the neighboring peri-urban and rural areas. The total groundwater extraction is maximized subject to these constraints, leading to specific extraction patterns throughout the city, depending upon the values set for the constraints. The optimization is performed by linear programming. For a given extraction rate, the two constraints can be traded off by the groundwater manager, causing different wells to be activated or deactivated. We demonstrate the applicability of the methodology by the example of the city of Lucknow, India, but it can be transferred to other cities facing conflicts of managing groundwater resources.

AB  - Climate change is likely to have major implications for wetland ecosystems, which will include altered water level regimes due to modifications in local and catchment hydrology. However, substantial uncertainty exists in the precise impacts of climate change on wetlands due in part to uncertainty in GCM projections. This paper explores the impacts of climate change upon river discharge within three sub-catchments of Loktak Lake, an internationally important wetland in northeast India. This is achieved by running pattern-scaled GCM output through distributed hydrological models (developed using MIKE SHE) of each sub-catchment. The impacts of climate change upon water levels within Loktak Lake are subsequently investigated using a water balance model. Two groups of climate change scenarios are investigated. Group 1 uses results from seven different GCMs for an increase in global mean temperature of 2 A degrees C, the purported threshold of ''dangerous'' climate change, whilst Group 2 is based on results from the HadCM3 GCM for increases in global mean temperature between 1 A degrees C and 6 A degrees C. Results from the Group 1 scenarios show varying responses between the three sub-catchments. The majority of scenario-sub-catchment combinations (13 out of 21) indicate increases in discharge which vary from < 1% to 42% although, in some cases, discharge decreases by as much as 20%. Six of the GCMs suggest overall increases in river flow to Loktak Lake (2-27%) whilst the other results in a modest (6%) decline. In contrast, the Group 2 scenarios lead to an almost linear increase in total river flow to Loktak Lake with increasing temperature (up to 27% for 6 A degrees C), although two sub-catchments experience reductions in mean discharge for the smallest temperature increases. In all but one Group 1 scenario, and all the Group 2 scenarios, Loktak Lake water levels are higher, regularly reaching the top of a downstream hydropower barrage that impounds the lake and necessitating the release of water for barrage structural stability. Although elevated water levels may permit enhanced abstraction for irrigation and domestic uses, future increases in hydropower generation are limited by existing infrastructure. The higher water levels are likely to exacerbate existing ecological deterioration within the lake as well as enhancing problems of flooding of lakeside communities.

AB  - Water levels within Loktak Lake, an internationally important wetland, are regulated to prioritize hydropower over other ecosystem services. High water levels have impacted ecological conditions, in particular floating vegetated islands. Barrage operation options prioritizing hydropower, agriculture and the lake ecosystem are developed using a lake water balance model. Current hydropower abstractions can be maintained without ecologically damaging high water levels. Enhanced agricultural abstractions reduce levels to meet ecological requirements. The latter could be satisfied without compromising current hydropower and agricultural abstractions. An integrated option shows it is largely possible to balance hydropower and agricultural abstractions with wetland water-level requirements. Sustainability of barrage operation options is assessed under climate change scenarios. Higher monsoon precipitation and river flow can be accommodated. Larger dry-season drawdowns impact most barrage operation options, especially the integrated option. Results demonstrate the requirement to consider current and potential future climatic conditions when developing wetland water-level management plans.

AB  - Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is a deep rooted drought tolerant crop that originated in desert environments of the Middle East, and could be very well adapted to the semi-arid Southern High Plains. A field experiment was conducted at Clovis, New Mexico during 2012 and 2013 seasons to assess drought physiology and yield formation of two diverse spring safflower cultivars under different irrigation levels with or without preseason irrigation. One half of the experimental blocks received preseason irrigation of 164 mm in 2012 and 153 mm in 2013 to refill the soil profile utilized by the previous crops, while the other half remained depleted. Five in-season irrigation levels (I-1-I-5) ranging from 88 to 392 mm in 2012 and from 83 to 373 mm in 2013 were imposed on both preseason irrigation and no-preseason irrigation blocks. Higher leaf water potential (psi(I)) was observed under increased water availability either by preseason irrigation or by higher in-season irrigation level in safflower during two observation dates in both years. Osmotic potential at full turgor (psi(pi 100)), photosynthesis rate (P-n) and transpiration rate (T-r) decreased with a reduction in psi(I) under water stress conditions. The relative water content (RWC) was affected only by the in-season irrigation levels in both years. The preseason irrigation increased seed yield of safflower by 39 and 118% over no-preseason irrigation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. A gradual increase in seed yield was observed with an increase in irrigation levels; and the highest irrigation level, I-5 increased seed yield by 85 and 171% over the lowest irrigation level, I-1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Seed yield increased with increase in P-n, plant biomass, number of heads per plant, and number of seeds per head but not with 1000-seed weight under increased water availability. Overall, increased availability of water through preseason irrigation or through in-season irrigation levels improved safflower physiology and yield formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of a market in groundwater usage rights can be inhibited by constraints arising from the institutional context. Such impediments may reduce the potential gains from trade and may generate high transaction costs for prospective traders. We analyse the regulations and policies influencing groundwater transfers in a case study area - the Gnangara groundwater system around Perth, Western Australia - and identify significant impediments to a groundwater market. Property rights are found to be conditional, temporary and vulnerable to amendment. Regulatory approval is required for all transfers. Facilitating infrastructure is lacking, and price information is unavailable. Management area boundaries reflect land ownership and use rather than hydrogeological realities; the limitation of transfers to within these boundaries eliminates much of the potential for gains from trade. Over-allocation and weak monitoring also impede the development of a market. The current management system is likely to obscure unmet demand for water-rights transfers between users and usage-types.

AB  - Groundwater extraction can have varied and diffuse effects. Negative external effects may include costs imposed on other groundwater users and on surrounding ecosystems. Environmental damages are commonly not reflected in market transactions. Groundwater transfers have the potential to cause spatial redistribution, concentration, and qualitative transformation of the impacts from pumping. An economically and environmentally sound groundwater transfer scheme would ensure that marginal costs from trades do not exceed marginal benefits, accounting for all third-party impacts, including those of a non-monetary nature as well as delayed effects. This paper proposes a menu of possible management strategies that would help preclude unacceptable impacts by restricting transfers with certain attributes, ideally ensuring that permitted transfers are at least welfare-neutral. Management tools would require that transfers limit or reduce environmental impacts, and provide for the compensation of financial impacts. Three management tools are described. While these tools can limit impacts from a given level of extraction, they cannot substitute for sustainable overall withdrawal limits. Careful implementation of transfer limits and exchange rates, and the strategic use of management area boundaries, may enable a transfer system to restrict negative externalities mainly to monetary costs. Provision for compensation of these costs could be built into the system.

AB  - A classification scheme for pollutant natural attenuation potential at the groundwater-surface water interface is presented, and its predictive power for explaining baseflow river nitrate concentration investigated. Both the classification scheme and statistical analysis are undertaken at Water Framework Directive surface water body scale for England and Wales, in baseflow conditions when relative groundwater contribution to rivers is greatest. The results of multiple regression analyses demonstrate statistically significant relationships between the classification of natural attenuation potential, its component properties, and baseflow river nitrate concentration. Natural attenuation at the groundwater-surface water interface is shown to be a significant control on observed river nitrate concentrations, albeit less influential than land-use descriptors. The results indicate that natural attenuation processes have a measurable impact on baseflow river chemistry at surface water body scale, and that consideration of natural attenuation processes at the groundwater-surface water interface would improve regional and catchment-scale risk prediction, and could help in the design of more sustainable catchment management strategies.

AB  - Many globally important groundwater aquifers are under considerable stress as withdrawals, predominantly for irrigation, outpace recharge. Meanwhile, groundwater policy to address the common-pool resource losses remains in its nascent stage. This study analyzes a recent and unique bottom-up effort to self-impose a groundwater pumping fee in San Luis Valley, Colorado. Utilizing a difference-in-difference econometric framework, our results bring new and direct empirical evidence to the debate on the use of economic incentives in groundwater policy. We find that the price intervention has been effective, leading to a 33% reduction in groundwater use, predominantly through reduced irrigation intensity. We also find, to a more limited extent, movement away from water-thirsty crops and reduced overall irrigated acreage. Given that financial incentives can produce substantial conservation within a groundwater commons in duress, price-based policies warrant further consideration as irrigators address diminishing and variable water supplies.

AB  - Access to safe and affordable drinking water for all is an important goal of SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Degradation of water quality of coastal aquifers is a major concern throughout the world including the Indus River delta. Looking at the present changing climate scenario, the study was conducted to assess and map the spatial variation in the groundwater quality of district Thatta using GIS (Geographic Information System). The groundwater samples from hundred (100) randomly selected hand pumps of the district were collected such that all union councils of the district were sampled. The water samples were analyzed for different physicochemical parameters, i.e. taste, color, odor, pH, turbidity, EC (Electrical Conductivity), calcium, magnesium, total hardness, chloride, total dissolved solids, and arsenic using standard laboratory techniques. The results of water analysis revealed that 85% of the groundwater samples had TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) concentration beyond the permissible limit described by WHO (World Health Organization). Whereas, all the groundwater samples had chloride concentration beyond permissible limit of 250 mg/l. Analysis for arsenic revealed that only 20% of groundwater samples had a concentration higher than the safe limit of 10 ppb. The study indicated that in most of the areas, the groundwater quality was not as per drinking standards prescribed by WHO, hence was not suitable for drinking purpose. The GIS maps of groundwater quality parameters were prepared using spatial interpolation Kriging tool. These maps provide the visual analysis and interpretation of spatial variability of different groundwater quality parameters, hence are supportive in monitoring and managing the vulnerability of groundwater contamination.

AB  - Heterogeneity in hydraulic properties of the subsurface is not accounted for in current design calculations of aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES). However, the subsurface is heterogeneous and thus affects the heat distribution around ATES wells. In this paper, the influence of heterogeneity on the performance of a doublet well system is quantified using stochastic heat transport modeling. The results show that on average, thermal recovery decreases with increasing heterogeneity, expressed as the lognormal standard deviation of the hydraulic conductivity field around the doublet. Furthermore, heterogeneity at the scale of a doublet ATES system introduces an uncertainty in the amount of expected thermal interference between the warm and cold storage. This results in an uncertainty in thermal recovery that also increases with heterogeneity and decreases with increasing distance between ATES wells. The uncertainty in thermal balance due to heterogeneity can reach values near 50 percent points in case of regional groundwater flow in excess of 200 m/yr. To account for heterogeneity whilst using homogeneous models, an attempt was made to express the effect of heterogeneity by an apparent macrodispersivity. As expected, apparent macrodispersivity increases with increasing heterogeneity. However, it also depends on well-to-well distance and regional groundwater velocity. Again, the uncertainty in thermal recovery is reflected in a range in the apparent macrodispersivity values. Considering the increasing density of ATES systems, we conclude that thermal interference limits the number of ATES systems that can be implemented in a specific area, and the uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity field related to heterogeneity should be accounted for when optimizing well-to-well distances.

AB  - Groundwater depletion occurs at a global scale but requires regional strategies for sustainable management of freshwater resources. In Denmark the groundwater quantity and quality is under pressure, and forested areas are considered to protect groundwater reservoirs. However, little is known on how afforestation or forest conversion impacts the water resource at the catchment scale. We hypothesize that the groundwater formation and streamflow is increased when water consuming conifers are replaced with the less consumptive broadleaf tree species. To test this a distributed hydrological model with an energy-based description of evaporation and transpiration processes (MIKE SHE SWET) was used. Large scale hydrological models were established for two geologically (sandy/clayey) contrasting catchments in Denmark; Skjern and Lejre catchments. Land use scenarios were defined with forest vegetation (conifer/broadleaf) and agricultural crops (grass, maize, wheat and barley) in different areal combinations. Initially, the SWET component was calibrated against plot scale field data from two forest sites to obtain vegetation parameter estimates for conifers and broadleaves. Subsequently, the catchment models were run for 10 years with predefined land use scenarios. MIKE SHE SWET simulated canopy interception and throughfall for conifers and broadleaf forests satisfactorily. The catchment simulations showed that replacing current conifer forests with broadleaves, resulted in a significant increase in groundwater recharge and groundwater level, especially in the Skjern catchment with predominantly sandy soils. Also, doubling the forest area, as intended by national legislations, using only broadleaves did not negatively affect the groundwater generation or minimum stream discharge compared to current conditions at Skjern. However, because the shallow geology in the Lejre catchment are dominated by clayey glacial moraine deposits with low hydraulic conductivity, increased net precipitation in areas covered by broadleaf forests would primarily discharge as overland flow or drainage flow rather than contributing to groundwater formation.

AB  - A large-scale groundwater flow and transport model is developed for a deep-seated (100 to 300 m below ground surface) sedimentary aquifer system. The model is based on a three-dimensional (3D) hydrostratigraphic model, building on a sequence stratigraphic approach. The flow model is calibrated against observations of hydraulic head and stream discharge while the credibility of the transport model is evaluated against measurements of Ar-39 from deep wells using alternative parameterizations of dispersivity and effective porosity. The directly simulated 3D mean age distributions and vertical fluxes are used to visualize the two-dimensional (2D)/3D age and flux distribution along transects and at the top plane of individual aquifers. The simulation results are used to assess the vulnerability of the aquifer system that generally has been assumed to be protected by thick overlaying clayey units and therefore proposed as future reservoirs for drinking water supply. The results indicate that on a regional scale these deep-seated aquifers are not as protected from modern surface water contamination as expected because significant leakage to the deeper aquifers occurs. The complex distribution of local and intermediate groundwater flow systems controlled by the distribution of the river network as well as the topographical variation (Toth 1963) provides the possibility for modern water to be found in even the deepest aquifers.

AB  - This paper presents a synthesis of water sustainability issues from the hydrologic perspective. It shows that safe yield is a flawed concept and that sustainability is an idea that is broadly used but perhaps not well understood. In general, the sustainable yield of an aquifer must be considerably less than recharge if adequate amounts of water are to be available to sustain both the quantity and quality of streams, springs, wetlands, and ground-water-dependent ecosystems. To ensure sustainability, it is imperative that water limits be established based on hydrologic principles of mass balance. To establish water-use policies and planning horizons, the transition curves of aquifer systems from ground-water storage depletion to induced recharge of surface water need to be developed. present-day numerical models are capable of generating such transition curves. Several idealized examples of aquifer systems show how this could be done. Because of the complexity of natural systems and the uncertainties in characterizing them, the current philosophy underlying sustainable management of water resources is based on the interconnected systems approach and on adaptive management. Examples of water-resources management from Kansas illustrate some of these concepts in a real-world setting. Some of the hallmarks of Kansas water management are the formation of local groundwater management districts, the adoption of minimum streamflow standards, the use of modified safe-yield policies in some districts, the implementation of integrated resource planning by the City of Wichita, and the subbasin water-resources manage ment program in potential problem areas. These are all appropriate steps toward sustainable development. The Kansas examples show that local decision-making is the best way to fully account fur local variability in water management. However, it is imperative that public education and involvement be encouraged, so that system complexities and constraints an better understood and overly simplistic solutions avoided.

AB  - The interactions between groundwater and surface water are complex. To understand these interactions in relation to climate, landform, geology, and biotic factors, a sound hydrogeoecological framework is needed. All these aspects are synthesized and exemplified in this overview. In addition, the mechanisms of interactions between groundwater and surface water (GW-SW) as they affect recharge-discharge processes are comprehensively outlined, and the ecological significance and the human impacts of such interactions are emphasized. Surface-water and groundwater ecosystems are viewed as linked components of a hydrologic continuum leading to related sustainability issues. This overview concludes with a discussion of research needs and challenges facing this evolving field. The biogeochemical processes within the upper few centimeters of sediments beneath nearly all surface-water bodies (hyporheic zone) have a profound effect on the chemistry of the water interchange, and here is where most of the recent research has been focusing. However, to advance conceptual and other modeling of GW-SW systems, a broader perspective of such interactions across and between surfacewater bodies is needed, including multidimensional analyses, interface hydraulic characterization and spatial variability, site-to-region regionalization approaches, as well as cross-disciplinary collaborations.

AB  - Sustainable use of groundwater must ensure not only that the future resource is not threatened by overuse, but also that natural environments that depend on the resource, such as stream baseflows, riparian vegetation, aquatic ecosystems, and wetlands are protected. To properly manage groundwater resources, accurate information about the inputs (recharge) and outputs (pumpage and natural discharge) within each groundwater basin is needed so that the long-term behavior of the aquifer and its sustainable yield can be estimated or reassessed. As a first step towards this effort, this work highlights some key groundwater recharge studies in the Kansas High Plains at different scales, such as regional soil-water budget and groundwater modeling studies, county-scale groundwater recharge studies, as well as field-experimental local studies, including some original new findings, with an emphasis on assumptions and limitations as well as on environmental factors affecting recharge processes. The general impact of irrigation and cultivation on recharge is to appreciably increase the amount of recharge, and in many cases to exceed precipitation as the predominant source of recharge. The imbalance between the water input (recharge) to the High Plains aquifer and the output (pumpage and stream baseflows primarily) is shown to be severe, and responses to stabilize the system by reducing water use, increasing irrigation efficiency, adopting water-saving land-use practices, and other measures are outlined. Finally, the basic steps necessary to move towards sustainable use of groundwater in the High Plains are delineated, such as improving the knowledge base, reporting and providing access to information, furthering public education, as well as promoting better understanding of the public's attitudinal motivations; adopting the ecosystem and adaptive management approaches to managing groundwater; further improving water efficiency; exploiting the full potential of dryland and biosaline agriculture; and adopting a goal of long-term sustainable use.

AB  - Conflicts between ecosystems and human needs for fresh water are increasing. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness in the hydrogeologic community of environmental flows (EFs) and to address the major challenges involved in their protection. Ground water is a key component of EFs, and therefore hydrogeologists are called upon to get involved in the ongoing debates about maintaining healthy riverine ecosystems. Promising opportunities for achieving EFs in both underallocated and overallocated basins as well as new methods for protecting fresh water ecosystems developed in different countries are outlined. EF protection measures include private water trusts, "upside-down instream flow water rights," the "public trust" doctrine, and water markets, among other measures. A number of knowledge gaps are identified, to which hydrogeologists could contribute, such as our rudimentary knowledge about ground water-dependent ecosystems, aspects of stream-aquifer interactions, and the impacts of land-use changes. The values that society places on the different uses of water ultimately determine where the water is allocated. EF requirements can be legitimately recognized and addressed by basing the environmental needs of hydrologic systems on robust science, focusing on increasing the productivity of water use, engaging society in understanding the benefits and costs of decisions that affect ecosystems, and taking advantage of various opportunities for achieving EF goals.

AB  - The US High Plains aquifer, one of the largest freshwater aquifer systems in the world, continues to decline, threatening the long-term viability of the region's irrigation-based economy. The eight High Plains States take different approaches to the development and management of the aquifer based on each state's body of water laws that abide by different legal doctrines, on which Federal laws are superposed, thus creating difficulties in integrated regional water-management efforts. Although accumulating hydrologic stresses and competing demands on groundwater resources are making groundwater management increasingly complex, they are also leading to innovative management approaches, which are highlighted in this paper as good examples for emulation in managing groundwater resources. It is concluded that the fragmented and piecemeal institutional arrangements for managing the supplies and quality of water are inadequate to meet the water challenges of the future. A number of recommendations for enhancing the sustainability of the aquifer are presented, including the formation of an interstate groundwater commission for the High Plains aquifer along the lines of the Delaware and Susquehanna River Basins Commissions in the US. Finally, some lessons on groundwater management that other countries can learn from the US experience are outlined.

AB  - The water-level decline of the High Plains/Ogallala aquifer is one of the largest water management concerns in the United States. The economy and livelihood of people living in that vast region depend almost exclusively on water extracted from that aquifer. A debate about its future is ongoing, and questions remain as to how best to conserve the groundwater resource. Maintaining the aquifer will require reductions in pumping and irrigated hectarage and adopting additional conservation measures. Eventually, the agricultural system will have to be based dominantly on the renewable water resources of the region. In effect, this means a limited-irrigation and/or dry-farming regime. What Kansas is currently doing to further extend the life of the aquifer is presented here together with additional measures that could be taken. A key management approach to help sustain the aquifer in western Kansas is to divide the aquifer into subunits on which to base localized management decisions. Another recently adopted measure is the establishment of local enhanced management areas, which would allow locally agreed upon specific corrective controls in those areas. History has shown that incentive and voluntary plans alone have not been successful in halting water-level declines. Thus, limits and timelines need to be set and checks must be in place to enforce strict administration of conservation measures. It is advocated that water laws be reformed and modernized so that water rights are constrained by the current availability of water and the preservation of the resource base for future generations.

AB  - An aquifer system, when perturbed, has a tendency to evolve to a new equilibrium, a process that can take from just a few seconds to possibly millions of years. The time scale on which a system adjusts to a new equilibrium is often referred to as response time or lag time. Because groundwater response time affects the physical and economic viability of various management options in a basin, natural resource managers are increasingly interested in incorporating it into policy. However, the processes of how groundwater responds to land-use change are not well understood, making it difficult to predict the timing of groundwater response to such change. The difficulty in estimating groundwater response time is further compounded because the data needed to quantify this process are not usually readily available. This article synthesizes disparate pieces of information on aquifer response times into a relatively brief but hopefully comprehensive review that the community of water professionals can use to better assess the impact of aquifer response time in future groundwater management investigations. A brief exposition on dimensional/scaling analysis is presented first, followed by an overview of aquifer response time for simplified aquifer systems. The aquifer response time is considered first from a water-quantity viewpoint and later expanded to incorporate groundwater age and water-quality aspects. Monitoring programs today, as well as water policies and regulations, should address this issue of aquifer response time so that more realistic management expectations can be reached.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to trace the evolution of key water-related laws and management practices in Kansas, from the enactment of the Kansas Water Resources Appropriation Act of 1945 to the present, in order to highlight the state's efforts to create a more sustainable water future and in hopes that others will benefit from Kansas' experience. The 1945 Act provides the basic framework of water law (prior appropriation) in Kansas. Progression of groundwater management in the state encompasses local Groundwater Management Districts (GMDs) and their water-management programs, minimum-streamflow and TMDL standards, water-use reporting and water metering programs, use of modified safe-yield policies in some GMDs, the subbasin water-resources-management program, the integrated resource planning/aquifer storage and recovery project of the city of Wichita, the Central Kansas Water Bank, enhanced aquifer subunits management, and various water conservation programs. While these have all contributed to the slowing down of declines in groundwater levels in the High Plains aquifer and in associated ecosystems, they have not yet succeeded in halting those declines. Based on the assumption that the different management approaches have to operate easily within the prevailing water rights and law framework to succeed, a number of steps are suggested here that may help further diminish or reverse the declines of the High Plains aquifer. These include eliminating the "use it or lose it" maxim in the prior-appropriation framework, broadening the definition of "beneficial use," regulating domestic and other "exempt" wells, encouraging voluntary "sharing the shortage" agreements, and determining to what extent water rights may be regulated in the public interest without a compensable "taking". Further measures include establishing artificial recharge and/or aquifer storage and recovery projects wherever feasible and determining to what extent water-rights holders might be subjected to reasonable dictates without having the security of their rights altered.

AB  - In Chennai (India) public water supply and agriculture depend on groundwater to various extents, but the valuable resource shows increasing salinity over the past decades due to seawater intrusion. This study aims at identifying major hydrogeological processes which lead to salinity ingress in the main aquifer and investigates the effect of MAR structures such as check dams. Regional hydrochemistry is discussed by a combination of stiff diagrams, Cl/Br ratios, ion exchange diagram and stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta D). The identified hydrogeochemical processes were high saline evolution due to intensive seawater evaporation for commercial salt production and typical ion displacement under refreshening and salinization conditions. Stable isotopes give new insights on (1) mixing processes of different end members (2) occurrence and degree of evaporation in ground- and surface water and (3) isotopical characterisation of groundwater recharge of the region. The identified processes were summarized in a conceptual model of the region.

AB  - Freshwater fish communities are structured through complex interactions among multiple spatial scales. Efforts to conserve and rehabilitate fish communities in riverine systems can benefit from an understanding of how processes across spatial scales influence species diversity patterns. We assessed species diversity at different hierarchical spatial scales and changes in species composition along the longitudinal gradient of the Niobrara River basin, Great Plains, USA. We assessed the contribution of - and -diversity components to -diversity at five spatial scales (i.e., mesohabitat, site, reach, segment, and river) using an additive partitioning approach. The observed mean -diversity was significantly greater than expected at the site, reach, and segment spatial scales. The most significant difference between expected and observed -diversity occurred at the segment spatial scale and suggests differences in community structure along the Niobrara River. Additive partitioning of diversity components provided a framework with which to assess patterns at multiple hierarchical levels. Our results suggest that changes in channel geomorphic and hydrologic conditions provide the impetus for species sorting resulting in unique fish assemblages along the Niobrara River. Conservation of species diversity for Great Plains fishes and other similar systems will likely benefit from considering species filtering processes at multiple spatial scales and maintaining intact hydrologic regimes across unique geomorphic boundaries.

AB  - Approximation surrogates are used to substitute the numerical simulation model within optimization algorithms in order to reduce the computational burden on the coupled simulation-optimization methodology. Practical utility of the surrogate-based simulation-optimization have been limited mainly due to the uncertainty in surrogate model simulations. We develop a surrogate-based coupled simulation-optimization methodology for deriving optimal extraction strategies for coastal aquifer management considering the predictive uncertainty of the surrogate model. Optimization models considering two conflicting objectives are solved using a multiobjective genetic algorithm. Objectives of maximizing the pumping from production wells and minimizing the barrier well pumping for hydraulic control of saltwater intrusion are considered. Density-dependent flow and transport simulation model FEMWATER is used to generate input-output patterns of groundwater extraction rates and resulting salinity levels. The nonparametric bootstrap method is used to generate different realizations of this data set. These realizations are used to train different surrogate models using genetic programming for predicting the salinity intrusion in coastal aquifers. The predictive uncertainty of these surrogate models is quantified and ensemble of surrogate models is used in the multiple-realization optimization model to derive the optimal extraction strategies. The multiple realizations refer to the salinity predictions using different surrogate models in the ensemble. Optimal solutions are obtained for different reliability levels of the surrogate models. The solutions are compared against the solutions obtained using a chance-constrained optimization formulation and single-surrogate-based model. The ensemble-based approach is found to provide reliable solutions for coastal aquifer management while retaining the advantage of surrogate models in reducing computational burden.

AB  - Management strategies for the optimal and sustainable use of groundwater resources are developed based on prescriptive models that use mathematical tools for simulation and optimization together with field data. Because of the uncertainty inherent in the groundwater systems, it is essential to verify the compliance of the implemented strategies to those prescribed by using proper monitoring techniques during and after the implementation stages of the groundwater management project. In this work, an adaptive management approach for optimal management and monitoring of coastal aquifers is proposed. A simulation-optimization approach is used to derive optimal pumping strategy for the management of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. Then, an optimal monitoring network is designed to evaluate the compliance of the aquifer responses in the field with those predicted by the simulation-optimization model. The designed network can be used to monitor the compliance in the field in terms of the salinity concentration levels, which result from the implementation of the optimal pumping strategy. Uncertainty in the values of groundwater parameters and the uncertainty resulting from the deviation of the pumping strategies from the prescribed optimum values are characterized by considering different realizations of these values in the three-dimensional density dependent flow and transport simulation model. A new objective for monitoring is considered in this study. The objective function consists of maximizing the coefficient of variation of the salinity concentration at the monitored locations and minimizing the correlation coefficient between the concentrations at the monitored locations. Using this objective, the monitoring locations are chosen in regions where the uncertainty in the concentration values is highest, and those locations where the correlation between the concentrations of the monitored locations is lowest, so that the redundancy in monitoring data is the least. The concentration data collected at the optimal compliance monitoring locations can be used as feedback information to improve the initially developed optimal coastal aquifer management strategies. The sequential modification of the optimal pumping strategies in stages is illustrated using numerical experiments. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Indian megacities face severe water supply problems owing to factors ranging from growing population to high municipal pipe leakage rates; no Indian city provides 24/7 water supply. Current approaches to addressing the problem have been "utility centric," overlooking the significance of decentralized activities by consumers, groundwater extraction via private wells, and aquifer recharge by rainwater harvesting. We propose a framework that makes it possible to evaluate a wider range of centralized and decentralized policies than previously considered. The framework was used to simulate water supply and demand in a simulation model of Chennai, India. Three very different policies, supply augmentation, efficiency improvement, and rainwater harvesting, were evaluated using the model. The model results showed that none of the three policies perfectly satisfied our criteria of efficiency, reliability, equity, financial viability, and revenue generation. Instead, a combination of rainwater harvesting and efficiency improvement best meets these criteria.

AB  - This article addresses a gap in the water equity literature arising from the simultaneous use of surface water and groundwater in India. Using two diverse case studies - one agricultural (Kukdi) and one urban (Chennai) - we demonstrate how gaps in planning, design and policy exacerbate inequity. Groundwater abstraction from user wells allows wealthier users to both free-ride and capture a greater share of the resource. By converting a public resource to a private one, it worsens inequity and jeopardizes the sustainability of water projects. The article suggests that better monitoring, inter-agency coordination and rethinking water entitlements and norms are needed for going forward.

AB  - A drilling project was carried out in Syria to assess the potential of the deep groundwater resources of the Cretaceous aquifer, composed of Cenomanian-Turonian limestones and dolomites. In this context, isotope (C-14, H-3, delta C-13, delta O-18, delta H-2) and hydrochemical analyses were performed on wells in and around the Aleppo and Steppe basins. The interpretation includes complementary results from published and unpublished literature. The results provide evidence that many new wells pump mixed groundwater from the Cretaceous aquifer and the overlying Paleogene aquifer. Radiocarbon measurements confirmed dominating Pleistocene groundwater in the Cretaceous aquifer and mainly Holocene groundwater in the Paleogene aquifer. Most groundwater in the Cretaceous aquifer seems to be recharged in the western limestone ridges, stretching from Jebel az Zawiyah (south of Idlep) via Jebel Samane (south of Afrin and A'zaz) to the region north of Aleppo, and in the Northern Palmyrides mountain belt. Some recharge also occurs around the basalt plateau of the Jebel al Hass, south east of Aleppo. It is concluded that the Taurus Mountains and the Euphrates River do not recharge the Cretaceous aquifer. The sources of recharge seem to be occasionally occurring intensive winter storms that approach from Siberia.

AB  - Consumptive use of water in a dispersed rural community has important implications for maximum housing density and its effects on sustainability of groundwater withdrawals. Recent rapid growth in Colorado, USA has stressed groundwater supplies in some areas, thereby increasing scrutiny of approximate methods developed there more than 30 years ago to estimate consumptive use that are still used today. A foothills residence was studied during a 2-year period to estimate direct and indirect water losses. Direct losses are those from evaporation inside the home, plus any outdoor use. Indirect loss is evapotranspiration (ET) from the residential leach-field in excess of ET from the immediately surrounding terrain. Direct losses were 18.7% of water supply to the home, substantially larger than estimated historically in Colorado. A new approach was developed to estimate indirect loss, using chamber methods together with the Penman-Monteith model. Indirect loss was only 0.9% of water supply, but this value probably was anomalously low due to a recurring leach-field malfunction. Resulting drainage beneath the leach-field was 80.4% of water supply. Guidelines are given to apply the same methodology at other sites and combine results with a survey of leach-fields in an area to obtain more realistic average values of ET losses.

AB  - Areas of Western and Central Europe were severely affected by devastating droughts in 2003 and 2015. A sharp decrease in annual atmospheric precipitation led to diminished spring discharges. Analysis of the fluctuations in discharge from three groups of springs in the south of Poland, namely in the Sudetes and Carpathian mountains, and in the German province of Bavaria revealed an average discharge reduction ranging from 52 to 4%. The study proved the existence of a relationship between diminished groundwater recharge from precipitation and the type of rock forming the reservoir as well as the parameters of the rock in the drained catchment. Spring discharge regime was compared for various periods to show that a decline in the regime correlates with a decline in river flow rate; considering the continually changing weather patterns, this correlation is arguably a key factor in sustainable water management.

AB  - A groundwater flow model of the Alpine valley aquifer in the Aosta Plain (NW Italy) showed that well pumping can induce river streamflow depletions as a function of well location. Analysis of the water budget showed that similar to 80% of the water pumped during 2 years by a selected well in the downstream area comes from the baseflow of the main river discharge. Alluvial aquifers hosted in Alpine valleys fall within a particular hydrogeological context where groundwater/surface-water relationships change from upstream to downstream as well as seasonally. A transient groundwater model using MODFLOW2005 and the Streamflow-Routing (SFR2) Package is here presented, aimed at investigating water exchanges between the main regional river (Dora Baltea River, a left-hand tributary of the Po River), its tributaries and the underlying shallow aquifer, which is affected by seasonal oscillations. The three-dimensional distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was obtained by means of a specific coding system within the database TANGRAM. Both head and flux targets were used to perform the model calibration using PEST. Results showed that the fluctuations of the water table play an important role in groundwater/surface-water interconnections. In upstream areas, groundwater is recharged by water leaking through the riverbed and the well abstraction component of the water budget changes as a function of the hydraulic conditions of the aquifer. In downstream areas, groundwater is drained by the river and most of the water pumped by wells comes from the base flow component of the river discharge.

AB  - Two novel antibiotics, thuggacin A (1) and B (2), were isolated from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum. 1 and 2 are unique thiazole-containing macrolides with side chains on both sides of the lactone group. Upon standing in solution, thuggacin A (1) rearranges by acyl migration of the lactone group to give a mixture with thuggacins B (2) and C (3). NOEs and vicinal coupling constants within the lactone ring provided distinct data for the generation of a structure model by PM3 calculations, which allowed an analysis of the conformation in solution and the relative configuration of six asymmetric centres. A minor sorangium metabolite was identified as 13-methyl-thuggacin A (4). Furthermore, two natural thuggacin variants, 5 and 6, were found in another myxobacterium, Chondromyces crocatus. In these variants, one side chain is replaced by a methyl group and a hydroxy group is repositioned to give a primary alcohol at the former methyl site, in an a position with respect to the thiazole ring. 1 proved to be active against clinical isolates and reference strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Preliminary studies on the mechanism of action indicate inhibition of the cellular electron-transport chain.

AB  - Groundwater provides a reliable tap to sustain agricultural production, yet persistent aquifer depletion threatens future sustainability. The High Plains Aquifer supplies 30% of the nation's irrigated groundwater, and the Kansas portion supports the congressional district with the highest market value for agriculture in the nation. We project groundwater declines to assess when the study area might run out of water, and comprehensively forecast the impacts of reduced pumping on corn and cattle production. So far, 30% of the groundwater has been pumped and another 39% will be depleted over the next 50 y given existing trends. Recharge supplies 15% of current pumping and would take an average of 500-1,300 y to completely refill a depleted aquifer. Significant declines in the region's pumping rates will occur over the next 15-20 y given current trends, yet irrigated agricultural production might increase through 2040 because of projected increases in water use efficiencies in corn production. Water use reductions of 20% today would cut agricultural production to the levels of 15-20 y ago, the time of peak agricultural production would extend to the 2070s, and production beyond 2070 would significantly exceed that projected without reduced pumping. Scenarios evaluate incremental reductions of current pumping by 20-80%, the latter rate approaching natural recharge. Findings substantiate that saving more water today would result in increased net production due to projected future increases in crop water use efficiencies. Society has an opportunity now to make changes with tremendous implications for future sustainability and livability.

AB  - This study examines the impact of a sloping base on the movement of transients through groundwater systems. Dimensionless variables and regression of model results are employed to develop functions relating the transient change in saturated thickness to the distance upgradient and downgradient from recharge or withdrawal. Convolution of these transient response functions (made possible due to linearity of partial differential equations in the model) enables computation of changes in saturated thickness over recharge/withdrawal that varies over space and time. Establishing the criteria and form of these functions led to the discovery of fundamental underlying properties: upgradient and downgradient responses may be scaled to achieve a symmetrical relationship, expressions are developed to compute change in saturated thickness at the location of water use, and downgradient response at large times form a S-shaped curve that effectively adds a diffusive component to the average velocity of the kinematic wave approximation, where the hydraulic gradient is equal to the bed slope. Hydrogeologic data for three study regions in the High Plains Aquifer are summarized, and model results are presented for changes in saturated thickness. The transient response functions are used to reconstruct and interpret groundwater response to historical water-use practices and to predict future changes in saturated thickness for a series of hypothetical alternative water-use scenarios. Depressions in groundwater elevation are observed both upgradient and downgradient from areas of high water use; however, these depressions preferentially move downgradient over time and may continue to spread downgradient far into the future. This approach quantifies and provides understanding of the impacts of changes in natural and anthropogenic hydrologic forcings on aquifer systems.

AB  - This paper reports on the qualitative and quantitative screening of groundwater sources for integration into the public water supply system of the Algarve, Portugal. The results are employed in a decision support system currently under development for an integrated water resources management scheme in the region. Such a scheme is crucial for several reasons, including the extreme seasonal and annual variations in rainfall, the effect of climate change on more frequent and long-lasting droughts, the continuously increasing water demand and the high risk of a single-source water supply policy. The latter was revealed during the severe drought of 2004 and 2005, when surface reservoirs were depleted and the regional water demand could not be met, despite the drilling of emergency wells. For screening and selection, quantitative criteria are based on aquifer properties and well yields, whereas qualitative criteria are defined by water quality indices. These reflect the well's degree of violation of drinking water standards for different sets of variables, including toxicity parameters, nitrate and chloride, iron and manganese and microbiological parameters. Results indicate the current availability of at least 1100 l s(-1) of high quality groundwater (55% of the regional demand), requiring only disinfection (900 l s(-1)) or basic treatment, prior to human consumption. These groundwater withdrawals are sustainable when compared to mean annual recharge, considering that at least 40% is preserved for ecological demands. A more accurate and comprehensive analysis of sustainability is performed with the help of steady-state and transient groundwater flow simulations, which account for aquifer geometry, boundary conditions, recharge and discharge rates, pumping activity and seasonality. They permit an advanced analysis of present and future scenarios and show that increasing water demands and decreasing rainfall will make the water supply system extremely vulnerable, with a high risk of groundwater salinization and ecosystem degradation.

AB  - Precipitation gauge catch correction is often given very little attention in hydrological modelling compared to model parameter calibration. This is critical because significant precipitation biases often make the calibration exercise pointless, especially when supposedly physically-based models are in play. This study addresses the general importance of appropriate precipitation catch correction through a detailed modelling exercise. An existing precipitation gauge catch correction method addressing solid and liquid precipitation is applied, both as national mean monthly correction factors based on a historic 30 yr record and as gridded daily correction factors based on local daily observations of wind speed and temperature. The two methods, named the historic mean monthly (HMM) and the time-space variable (TSV) correction, resulted in different winter precipitation rates for the period 1990-2010. The resulting precipitation datasets were evaluated through the comprehensive Danish National Water Resources model (DK-Model), revealing major differences in both model performance and optimised model parameter sets. Simulated stream discharge is improved significantly when introducing the TSV correction, whereas the simulated hydraulic heads and multi-annual water balances performed similarly due to recalibration adjusting model parameters to compensate for input biases. The resulting optimised model parameters are much more physically plausible for the model based on the TSV correction of precipitation. A proxy-basin test where calibrated DK-Model parameters were transferred to another region without site specific calibration showed better performance for parameter values based on the TSV correction. Similarly, the performances of the TSV correction method were superior when considering two single years with a much dryer and a much wetter winter, respectively, as compared to the winters in the calibration period (differential split-sample tests). We conclude that TSV precipitation correction should be carried out for studies requiring a sound dynamic description of hydrological processes, and it is of particular importance when using hydrological models to make predictions for future climates when the snow/rain composition will differ from the past climate. This conclusion is expected to be applicable for mid to high latitudes, especially in coastal climates where winter precipitation types (solid/liquid) fluctuate significantly, causing climatological mean correction factors to be inadequate.

AB  - Groundwater is one of the main resources for drinking water. Its quality is still threatened by the widespread contaminant nitrate (NOT). In order to manage groundwater resources in a sustainable manner, we need to find options of lowering nitrate input. Particularly, a comprehensive knowledge of nitrate sources is required in areas which are important current and future drinking water reservoirs such as pre-alpine aquifers covered with permanent grassland. The objective of the present study was to identify major sources of nitrate in groundwater with low mean nitrate concentrations (8 +/- 2 mg/L). To achieve the objective, we used environmental tracer approaches in four pre-alpine groundwater catchments. The stable isotope composition and tritium content of water were used to study the hydrogeology and transit times. Furthermore, nitrate stable isotope methods were applied to trace nitrogen from its sources to groundwater. The results of the nitrate isotope analysis showed that groundwater nitrate was derived from nitrification of a variety of ammonium sources such as atmospheric deposition, mineral and organic fertilizers and soil organic matter. A direct influence of mineral fertilizer, atmospheric deposition and sewage was excluded. Since temporal variation in stable isotopes of nitrate were detected only in surface water and locally at one groundwater monitoring well, aquifers appeared to be well mixed and influenced by a continuous nitrate input mainly from soil derived nitrogen. Hydrogeological analysis supported that the investigated aquifers were less vulnerable to rapid impacts due to long average transit times, ranging from 5 to 21 years. Our study revealed the importance of combining environmental tracer approaches and a comprehensive sampling campaign (local sources of nitrate, soil water, river water, and groundwater) to identify the nitrate sources in groundwater and its vulnerability. In future, the achieved results will help develop targeted strategies for a sustainable groundwater management focusing more on soil nitrogen storage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water management is becoming increasingly salient as climate change continues to alter the environment, resulting in more severe and frequent droughts. To address water management issues, large-scale projects may be needed. However, public support is often a prerequisite for governments at all levels to enact such projects. Given the growing importance of these issues, there are few recent studies that explore public attitudes, preferences, and risk assessments about water-related resource allocations. Will the public act to constrain the actions of their elected officials? Is the public ready to begin considering policies, regulations, and expenditures that address the potential impacts of increased drought frequency on local, state and national water resources? This research reports the results of two national public opinion surveys in the United States that focused on water management and drought issues. The results indicate that the public is willing to support government efforts to manage water, but not if they negatively affect the environment or agriculture.

AB  - The Maltese islands are composed of two limestone aquifers, the Upper and Lower Coralline Limestone separated by an aquitard, the 'Blue Clay'. The Lower Coralline Limestone is overlain in part by the poorly permeable Globigerina Limestone. The upper perched aquifers are discontinuous and have very limited saturated thickness and a short water level response time to rainfall. Frequent detections of coliforms suggest a rapid route to groundwater. However, the unsaturated zone has a considerable thickness in places and the primary porosity of the Upper Coralline Limestone is high, so there is likely to be older recharge by slow matrix flow as well as rapid recharge from fractures. Measurement of SF(6) from a pumping station in a deep part of one of the perched aquifers indicated a mean saturated zone age of about 15 a. The Main Sea Level aquifers (MSL) on both Malta and Gozo have a large unsaturated thickness as water levels are close to sea level. On Malta, parts of the aquifer are capped by the perched aquifers and more extensively by the Globigerina Limestone. The limited detection of coliform bacteria suggests only some rapid recharge from the surface via fractures or karst features. Transmissivity is low and (3)H and CFC/SF(6) data indicate that saturated zone travel times are in the range 15-40 a. On Gozo the aquifer is similar but is more-extensively capped by impermeable Blue Clay. CFC data show the saturated zone travel time is from 25 a to possibly more than 60 a. Groundwater age is clearly related to the extent of low-permeability cover. The delta(13)C signature of groundwater is related to the geochemical processes which occur along the flowpath and is consistent with residence time ages in the sequence; perched aquifers < Malta MSL < Gozo MSL The (18)O and (2)H enriched isotopic signature of post 1983 desalinated water can be seen in more-modern groundwater, particularly the urbanized areas of the perched and Malta MSL aquifers. In all aquifers, movement of solutes from the surface travelling slowly through the matrix provide a long-term source of groundwater contaminants such as NO(3).

AB  - Intensive groundwater extraction causes many environmental problems globally. Reducing groundwater extraction is a primary method for alleviating these problems. However, this reduction may create new pollution issues because of an increase in groundwater vulnerability. A case study was done using the DRAOTIC evaluation method (an improved DRASTIC method for organic pollutant in aquifer vulnerability; soil (S factor) has been updated by organic matter (O factor) in the method) for the Hun River Basin, northeastern China, where groundwater intensive extraction had caused serious environmental and hydrogeological problems. The assessment results show that moderate vulnerability level is the main vulnerability level in the Hun River Basin; high vulnerability level and low vulnerability level categories occupy a smaller area; while very high and very low vulnerability categories occupy the smallest area. By combining the predicted groundwater level distribution and DRAOTIC model, the responses of groundwater vulnerability to different groundwater extraction reductions could be studied. The results show that groundwater vulnerability levels increased as groundwater extraction was reduced; this is because the rising groundwater levels make it easier for pollution coming from the surface to reach the aquifer. The more the reduction in groundwater extraction, the greater the increase in the area with higher vulnerability levels, and the greater the increase in pollution risk.

AB  - The understanding of runoff generation mechanisms is crucial for the sustainable management of river basins such as the allocation of water resources or the prediction of floods and droughts. However, identifying the mechanisms of runoff generation has been a challenging task, even more so in arid and semi-arid areas where high rainfall and streamflow variability, high evaporation rates, and deep groundwater reservoirs may increase the complexity of hydrological process dynamics. Isotope and hydrochemical tracers have proven to be useful in identifying runoff components and their characteristics. Moreover, although widely used in humid temperate regions, isotope hydrograph separations have not been studied in detail in arid and semiarid areas. Thus the purpose of this study is to determine whether isotope hydrograph separations are suitable for the quantification and characterization of runoff components in a semi-arid catchment considering the hydrological complexities of these regions. Through a hydrochemical characterization of the surface water and groundwater sources of the catchment and two-and three-component hydrograph separations, runoff components of the Kaap catchment in South Africa were quantified using both isotope and hydrochemical tracers. No major disadvantages while using isotope tracers over hydrochemical tracers were found. Hydrograph separation results showed that runoff in the Kaap catchment is mainly generated by groundwater sources. Two-component hydrograph separations revealed groundwater contributions of between 64 and 98% of total runoff. By means of threecomponent hydrograph separations, runoff components were further separated into direct runoff, shallow and deep groundwater components. Direct runoff, defined as the direct precipitation on the stream channel and overland flow, contributed up to 41% of total runoff during wet catchment conditions. Shallow groundwater defined as the soil water and nearsurface water component (and potentially surface runoff) contributed up to 45% of total runoff, and deep groundwater contributed up to 84% of total runoff. A strong correlation for the four studied events was found between the antecedent precipitation conditions and direct runoff. These findings suggest that direct runoff is enhanced by wetter conditions in the catchment that trigger saturation excess overland flow as observed in the hydrograph separations.

AB  - The Nubian Sandstone (NSS) aquifer of northeast Africa is believed to have been recharged in previous wet climatic periods in the Quaternary Period. While this is largely true, we show using the Sinai Peninsula as our test site that the aquifer is locally receiving modern recharge under the current dry climatic conditions. The validity of the advocated model was tested using geophysical (conventional electrical resistivity [ER]) and isotopic (O, H) data, and estimates for modern recharge were obtained using continuous rainfall-runoff modeling over the period 1998-2007. Interpretations of ER profiles are consistent with the presence of unconfined NSS aquifers flooring recharge areas at the foothills of the crystalline basement in Sinai at Baraga (thickness: 20 to >188 m; resistivity: 16-130 Omega m) and Zalaga (thickness: 27 to >115 m; resistivity: 3-202 Omega m). The isotopic composition (delta D: -22.7 to -32.8 parts per thousand; delta O-18: -4.47 to -5.22 parts per thousand) of groundwater samples from wells tapping the NSS aquifer underlying recharge areas is consistent with mixing between two endmembers: (1) fossil groundwater with isotopic compositions similar to those of the Western Desert NSS aquifer (delta D: -72 to -81 parts per thousand; delta O-18: -10.6 to -11.9 parts per thousand), and (2) average modern meteoric precipitation (delta D: -9.84 parts per thousand; delta O-18: -3.48 parts per thousand) in Sinai, with the latter endmember being the dominant component. A first-order estimate for the average annual modern recharge for the NSS aquifer was assessed at similar to 13.0 x 10(6) m(3)/yr using the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model. Findings bear on the sustainable exploitation of the NSS aquifer, where the aquifer is being locally recharged, and on the exploitation of similar extensive aquifers that were largely recharged in previous wet climatic periods but are still receiving modest modem meteoric contributions.

AB  - Chemical and stable isotopic compositions of groundwater samples from the Rub At Khali (RAK) in southern Saudi Arabia were analyzed. Samples were collected from wells of variable depth (1.5-800 m) along the perimeter of the eastern half of the RAK including flowing artesian wells, pumped wells (formerly artesian), and shallow hand-dug wells encompassing those in sabkha areas. Data indicate that the water from the artesian and formerly artesian wells represents the contents of confined aquifers. Such water (Group 1) is isotopicatly depleted (delta(2)H values ranging from -60 parts per thousand. to -35 parts per thousand), and has total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations ranging from 1300 to 76,000 mg/L, indicating that much of the salinity is acquired in the subsurface. Water from shallow hand-dug wells including those in sabkha areas (Group 2) has experienced significant evaporation (5 2 H values ranging from -34 parts per thousand to +19 parts per thousand as well as salinization (TDS as high as 92,000 mg/L) by dissolution of sabkha salts including halite and gypsum. Stable isotope data for the Group 2 water samples define an evaporation trend line originating from the Group 1 water samples. This relationship indicates that the Group 2-type water evolved from Group 1-type water by ascending through structural discontinuities, dissolving evaporative salts, and undergoing substantial near-surface evaporation in groundwater discharge zones (sabkhas) characterized by shallow groundwater levels (<2 m). This interpretation is supported by the relatively unradiogenic Sr isotope ratios of groundwater samples (Sr(87)/Sr(86) = 0.70771-0.70874) that are inconsistent with that of modern seawater ((87)Sr/(86)Sr = 0.70932). The RAK aquifer water represents either high-elevation recharge from the Red Sea Hills, and/or recharge largely formed of paleo-water precipitated during moist climate intervals of the late Pleistocene recharging aquifers cropping out at the foothills of the Red Sea mountains. This inference is supported by a progressive decrease in hydraulic head and increase in groundwater salinity from west to east, substantial precipitation over the Red Sea Hills, and a major E-W trending channel network that channels precipitation from the Red Sea Hills toward recharge areas. Analysis of 3-hourly TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission: 1998-2006) precipitation data and digital elevation data shows that 27% of the average annual precipitation (150 x 10(9) m(3)) over the Arabian Peninsula is channeled toward the recharge zone of the RAK aquifer system, of which an estimated 4 x 10(9) m(3) a(-1) to 10 x 10(9) m(3) a(-1) of this water is partitioned as recharge to the RAK aquifer system. Additional integrated studies on recharge rates, sustainability, and water quality issues for the RAK aquifers could demonstrate that the RAK is one of the most promising sites for groundwater exploration in the Arabian Peninsula. Results highlight the importance of investigating the potential for sustainable exploitation of similar large aquifer systems that were largely recharged in previous wet climatic periods yet are still receiving modest modern meteoric contributions.

AB  - Rising demands for fresh water supplies in and lands are leading to excessive exploitation and unsustainable mining of non-renewable fossil groundwater. Using the Nubian Aquifer of Saharan Africa as a test site, we demonstrate an integrated approach to identify areas of discharge that could have gone undetected, and to model extraction that is sustained by natural discharge. Using isotopic and geochemical analyses along with field and remote sensing data we show that discharge of the Nubian Aquifer is occurring on a Larger scale, primarily through deep-seated fault systems, and that ascending groundwater discharges into relatively thick alluvial aquifers proximal to the fault complex that defines the River Nile and the Gulf of Suez. We develop a hydrologic model to assess the discharge and to constrain sustainable extraction in the Asyuti area along the River Nile and to demonstrate a replicable model for similar reservoirs. A two-dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed and calibrated against head data from 19 wells. Results point to a significant contribution to the Asyuti groundwater system from rising Nubian groundwater (3.19 x 10(7) m(3)/yr: 75% of incoming flow) and a modest contribution (1.08 x 10(7) m(3)/yr: 25% of incoming flow) from surface runoff. Approximately 2.5 x 10(7) m(3)/yr of groundwater could be used in a sustainable manner in Asyuti. Assuming geologic settings and discharge rates similar to those at Asyuti, we estimate that 70 x 10(7) m(3)/yr of groundwater may be available for sustainable development in similar settings around the River Nile and the Gulf of Suez.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility of downscaling Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data for predicting groundwater level changes and, thus, enhancing current capability for sustainable water resources management. In many parts of the world, water management decisions are traditionally informed by in situ observation networks which, unfortunately, have seen a decline in coverage in recent years. Since its launch, GRACE has provided terrestrial water storage change (TWS) data at global and regional scales. The application of GRACE data for local-scale groundwater resources management has been limited because of uncertainties inherent in GRACE data and difficulties in disaggregating various TWS components. In this work, artificial neural network (ANN) models are developed to predict groundwater level changes directly by using a gridded GRACE product and other publicly available hydrometeorological data sets. As a feasibility study, ensemble ANN models are used to predict monthly and seasonal water level changes for several wells located in different regions across the US. Results indicate that GRACE data play a modest but significantly role in the performance of ANN ensembles, especially when the cyclic pattern of groundwater hydrograph is disrupted by extreme climate events, such as the recent Midwest droughts. The statistical downscaling approach taken here may be readily integrated into local water resources planning activities.

AB  - In arid and semiarid areas, the issues of water security, ecological security, and food security are tightly interlinked. Understanding the water-ecosystem-agriculture (WEA) nexus in such areas is critical to their sustainable development. This study presents a basin-scale integrated ecohydrological model and a paradigm for analyzing the WEA nexus through physically based modeling. The integrated model is successfully applied to the Heihe River Basin (HRB), the second largest endorheic river basin in China. A system analysis of the WEA nexus in the HRB is performed using the validated model. The major findings are as follows. First, reducing the amount of irrigation water applied to the midstream of the HRB produces widely varying effects on the water balance of the basin. Second, a threshold of 11.5 x 10(8) m(3)/yr is found for the streamflow from the midstream region to the downstream region, beyond which the contribution of the streamflow to the recovery of vegetation is trivial in the short term. Third, the trade-off among water conservation, ecosystem protection, and food production in the HRB is strong, and it is highly sensitive to the water management strategy employed. Evaporative water-saving practices are more desirable than direct water-saving regulation of irrigation water from the perspective of the WEA nexus. Overall, the results of the study provide insights into the allocation of water resources, ecosystem conservation, and agricultural development in the vast arid and semiarid areas of the world.

AB  - Groundwater over exploitation leads to seawater intrusion in coastal area and influence the quality of the groundwater aquifers. Geophysical and Hydrochemical investigations were carried out to determine subsurface geologic formation and assessing seawater intrusion in Tanah Mas Residential area of North Semarang, Indonesia. The seawater intrusion was investigated by 2D geoelectrical resistivity imaging and generated using multi-electrode system with Wenner array configuration. Chemical analyses of groundwater samples of indicated the range of salt concentrations meanwhile correlation of geophysical data in the study area allows for the predictions of seawater-contaminated zones and their influence on in situ salinity in the study area. The 12 geo-electrical sections were obtain up to penetration depth of about 27 m for a total length of 150 m. The results of groundwater chemical testing indicated that there are three groundwater samples with high levels of chloride ions. The three groundwater samples with high levels of chloride ions are from wells F (434455, 9231239), J (434610, 9230204) and M (434117, 9231156). Seawater intrusion in the study area were also detected and confirmed by the resistivity measurement. It can be concluded that the seawater intrusion has reached the north, east and southern parts of the Tanah Mas Residential area.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative analysis of System Dynamics Modelling (SDM) and Object-Oriented Bayesian Networks (OOBN). Both techniques are extensively used for water resources modelling due to their flexibility, effectiveness in assessing different management options, ease of operation and suitability for encouraging stakeholder involvement. Conversely, both approaches have several important differences that make them complementary. For example, while SDM is more suitable for simulating the feedback dynamics of processes, OOBN modelling is a powerful tool for modelling systems with uncertain inputs (or outputs) characterised by probability distributions. This comparative analysis is applied to the Kairouan aquifer system, Tunisia, where the aquifer plays an essential role for socio-economic development in the region. Both models produced comparable results using baseline data, and show their complementarity through a suite of scenario tests. It is shown that reducing pumping of groundwater to coastal cities may prove the key to reducing the current aquifer deficit, though local demand reduction must be considered to preserve the agricultural economy. It is suggested that water management assessment should be tackled using both approaches to complement each other, adding depth and insight, and giving a more coherent picture of the problem being addressed, allowing for robust policy decisions to be made.

AB  - In drylands, groundwater is often the sole source of freshwater for industrial, domestic and agricultural uses, while concurrently supporting ecosystems. Many dryland aquifers are becoming depleted due to over-pumping and a lack of natural recharge, resulting in loss of storage and future water supplies, water-level declines that reduce access to freshwater, water quality problems, and, in extreme cases, geologic hazards. Conservation is often proposed as a strategy for managing groundwater to reduce or reverse the depletion, although there is a need to better understand its potential effectiveness and benefits at the local scale. This study assesses the impact of water-conservation planning strategies on groundwater resources in the Wadi El Natrun (WEN) area of northern Egypt. WEN has been subjected to groundwater depletion and quality degradation since the 1990s, attributed to agricultural and industrial groundwater usage. Initiatives have been proposed to increase the sustainability of the groundwater resource in the study area, but they have yet to be evaluated. Simultaneously, there are also proposals to increase the extent of arable land and thus demand for freshwater. In this study, three water management scenarios are developed and assessed to the 2060s for their impact on groundwater resources using a hydrogeologic model. Results demonstrate that demand management implemented through an optimized irrigation and crop rotation strategy has the greatest potential to significantly reduce risk of groundwater depletion compared to the other two scenarios-"business as usual" and "30% water-use reduction"-that were evaluated.

AB  - A digital filtering algorithm for continuous base flow separation is compared to physically based simulations of base flow. It is shown that the digital filter gives comparable results to model simulations in terms of the multiyear base flow index when a filter coefficient is used that replicates the watershed-specific time delay of model simulations. This way, the application of the heuristic digital filter for practical continuous base flow separation can be justified when auxiliary hydrometeorological data (such as precipitation and, air temperature) typically required for physically based base flow separation techniques are not available or not representative of the watershed. The filter coefficient can then be optimized upon an empirical estimate of the watershed-specific time delay, requiring only the drainage area of the watershed.

The hydraulic and contaminant modeling using the Modflow-2000 and MT3DMS simulation software are resorted for evaluation of the available options. Methodology is developed and illustrated for reviewing the alternative remediation approaches for optimal selection of the best remediation approach to aquifer recharging from surface waters. The effectiveness of the present systematic approach is demonstrated by identifying the best choice among the multifunctional artificial recharge options available for the Great Forest Park in Debrecen, Hungary.

AB  - Flooding is a major disturbance that impacts aquatic ecosystems and the ecosystem services that they provide. Predicted increases in global flood risk due to land use change and water cycle intensification will likely only increase the frequency and severity of these impacts. Extreme flooding events can cause loss of life and significant destruction to property and infrastructure, effects that are easily recognized and frequently reported in the media. However, flooding also has many other effects on people through freshwater aquatic ecosystem services, which often go unrecognized because they are less evident and can be difficult to evaluate. Here, we identify the effects that small magnitude frequently occurring floods (<10-year recurrence interval) and extreme floods (>100-year recurrence interval) have on ten aquatic ecosystem services through a systematic literature review.We focused on ecosystem services considered by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment including: (1) supporting services (primary production, soil formation), (2) regulating services (water regulation, water quality, disease regulation, climate regulation), (3) provisioning services (drinking water, food supply), and (4) cultural services (aesthetic value, recreation and tourism). The literature search resulted in 117 studies and each of the ten ecosystem services was represented by an average of 12 +/- 4 studies. Extreme floods resulted in losses in almost every ecosystem service considered in this study. However, small floods had neutral or positive effects on half of the ecosystem services we considered. For example, small floods led to increases in primary production, water regulation, and recreation and tourism. Decision-making that preserves small floods while reducing the impacts of extreme floods can increase ecosystem service provision and minimize losses.

AB  - Groundwater from the La Paz arid coastal aquifer in Baja California, Mexico, is essentially the only source of drinking water for the local population and tourists, as well as irrigation water for agricultural needs. The intensive exploitation of the aquifer and water cycling has resulted in groundwater abatement (up to 10 m) and high salinity (up to similar to 5800 mg l(-1)). A study using hydrochemistry, isotopic (deuterium, oxygen-18 and carbon-14) and gaseous tracers (chlorofluorocarbons CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113), as well as multivariate statistics, was developed to elucidate groundwater composition, flow and occurrence. Groundwater is of meteoric origin, and a large proportion is subject to evaporation. The primary natural recharge is generated in the El Novillo and Las Cruces ranges, and groundwater subsequently flows in a SE-NW direction toward the coast. The initial water type is the result of discordant dissolution of silicate minerals and ion exchange on soils. In the lower plain portion, the aquifer system is recharged from irrigation return flow and seawater intrusion, which significantly affects groundwater chemistry. Nitrate and chloride concentrations indicate that groundwater is highly affected by an overuse of fertilizers in agricultural activities, but there is little effect from urban activities. Seawater intrusion has progressed rapidly during the past decade, and the impact currently extends 13 km inland. Radiocarbon residence time calculations suggest that groundwater is modern, with the exception of Chametla and El Centerario sites in the central and western lowlands with ages of up to similar to 5000 years. These waters indicate an additional recharge source for the upconing of fossil groundwater or regional flow.

AB  - Australian governments have set an ambitious policy agenda for reform. By 2010, water plans were to have provided for the return of all overallocated or overused systems to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction, however, many communities do not yet have full confidence in water plans or their processes. In two national research projects we developed practical tools for transparent and engaging processes to build confidence in water planning. We observe that inherent politicised risks in water planning mean that current methods of public participation, such as information giving and allowing written submissions, are 'safer' and more easily managed. The next article in this special issue sets out the methodology including performance indicators for the tools that we used in the research. To demonstrate their role in building community confidence using best available science we trialled tools which included agent-based participatory modelling, deliberative multi-criteria evaluation, social impact assessment, and groundwater visualisation models. The suite of 'good-practice' tools, including Indigenous engagement, is fully described in the following articles of this special issue. Evaluations show deliberative processes have much to offer when applied to questions that have been developed collaboratively and formulated carefully to allow implementation of findings. Interactive tools and those which have high visual impact are consistently rated highly by all sectors of the community, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and also by water planners. These results have implications for water planning internationally especially where science is contested, social values are uncertain, and communities are diverse. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is often used to estimate actual evapotranspiration in water balance studies. In this study, the present and future spatial distributions and temporal trends of ET0 in the Xiangjiang River Basin (XJRB) in China were analyzed. ET0 during the period from 1961 to 2010 was calculated with historical meteorological data using the FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO P-M) method, while ET0 during the period from 2011 to 2100 was downscaled from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) outputs under two emission scenarios, representative concentration pathway 4.5 and representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP45 and RCP85), using the statistical downscaling model (SDSM). The spatial distribution and temporal trend of ET0 were interpreted with the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method and Mann-Kendall test method, respectively. Results show that: (1) the mean annual ET0 of the XJRB is 1 006.3 mm during the period from 1961 to 2010, and the lowest and highest values are found in the northeast and northwest parts due to the high latitude and spatial distribution of climatic factors, respectively; (2) the SDSM performs well in simulating the present ET0 and can be used to predict the future ET0 in the XJRB; and (3) CMIP5 predicts upward trends in annual ET0 under the RCP45 and RCP85 scenarios during the period from 2011 to 2100. Compared with the reference period (1961e1990), ET0 increases by 9.8%, 12.6%, and 15.6% under the RCP45 scenario and 10.2%, 19.1%, and 27.3% under the RCP85 scenario during the periods from 2011 to 2040, from 2041 to 2070, and from 2071 to 2100, respectively. The predicted increasing ET0 under the RCP85 scenario is greater than that under the RCP45 scenario during the period from 2011 to 2100. (C) 2015 Hohai University.

AB  - Shallow aquifers are an important source of water resources and provide base flow to streams; yet actual rates of groundwater recharge are difficult to estimate. While climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events, the resulting impact on groundwater recharge remains poorly understood. We quantify empirical relations between precipitation characteristics and episodic groundwater recharge for a wide variety of geographic and land use types across North Carolina. We extract storm duration, magnitude, average rate, and hourly weighted intensity from long-term precipitation records over periods of 12-35 years at 10 locations. Using time series of water table fluctuations from nearby monitoring wells, we estimate relative recharge to precipitation ratios (RPR) to identify statistical trends. Increased RPR correlates with increased storm duration, whereas RPR decreases with increasing magnitude, average rate, and intensity of precipitation. Agricultural and urban areas exhibit the greatest decrease in RPR due to increasing storm magnitude, average rate, and intensity, while naturally vegetated areas exhibit a larger increase in RPR with increased storm duration. Though RPR is generally higher during the winter than the summer, this seasonal effect is magnified in the Appalachian and Piedmont regions. These statistical trends provide valuable insights into the likely consequences of climate and land use change for water resources in subtropical climates. If, as predicted, growing seasons lengthen and the intensity of storms increases with a warming climate, decreased recharge in Appalachia, the Piedmont, and rapidly growing urban areas of the American Southeast could further limit groundwater availability.

AB  - We present a detailed analysis of the effect of agricultural irrigation water abstraction on surface water, energy state and flux, using a model simulation to predict changes in Bowen Ratio, surface temperature and water resources within the Mekong River Basin. Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model including the infiltration, surface runoff, subsurface runoff, drainage from the soil layer, and irrigation scheme, together with the most recently available and accurate geophysical, geological and meteorological forcing datasets, we carried out the hydrological simulation on three calibration parameters. The multi-objective complex evolution (MOCOM-UA) optimizer was used to calibrate the model, which revealed a significant decrease in Bowen Ratio due to irrigation water withdrawal: this in turn affected surface temperature. We conclude that (1) the performance of the improved model was generally good, with an overall Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.86 for the validation period 1986-1993; (2) the volume-based total Net Irrigation Water Requirement was about 24 x 10(9) m(3)/year for the period 1979-2000; (3) including the irrigation water withdrawals from runoff, river channels and dams decreases the total monthly runoff by 32% compared to the "no irrigation" baseline; (4) the period-averaged Bowen Ratio decreased by 6.8% in the dry season as a result of irrigation effects; (5) this significant decrease in Bowen Ratio resulted in a decrease in average surface temperature of 9.3 x 10(-2)% and a maximum of 4.8% over irrigated areas during the dry season.

AB  - Across equatorial Africa, increasing demand for groundwater has raised concerns about resource sustainability and has highlighted the need for reliable estimates of groundwater recharge. Recharge investigations in this environment are typically inhibited by a shortage of good quality meteorological and hydrogeological records. Moreover, when recharge studies are attempted they tend to rely on a single technique and frequently lack corroborating evidence to substantiate recharge predictions. In recent studies undertaken in the Aroca catchment of the Victoria Nile basin in central Uganda, the timing and magnitude of recharge determined by a soil moisture balance approach are supported by stable isotope data and groundwater flow modelling. The soil moisture balance study reveals that recharge averages in the order of 200 mm year(-1) and is more dependent on the number of heavy (more than 10 mm day(-1)) rainfall events than the total annual volume of rainfall. Stable isotope data suggest independently that recharge occurs during the heaviest rains of the monsoons, and further establish that recharge stems entirely from the direct infiltration of rainfall, an assumption implicit in the soil moisture balance approach. Deforestation over the last 30 years is shown to have more than doubled the recharge estimate. Aquifer flow modelling supports the recharge estimates but demonstrates that the vast majority (over 99%) of recharging waters must be transmitted by the aquifer in the regolith rather the underlying bedrock fractures which have traditionally been developed for rural water supplies.

AB  - Measurements of the stable isotopes oxygen-18 (O-18) and deuterium (H-2) were carried out in two meso-scale catchments, Chemoga (358 km(2)) and Jedeb (296 km(2)) south of Lake Tana, Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. The region is of paramount importance for the water resources in the Nile basin, as more than 70% of total Nile water flow originates from the Ethiopian highlands. Stable isotope compositions in precipitation, spring water and streamflow were analysed (i) to characterise the spatial and temporal variations of water fluxes; (ii) to estimate the mean residence time of water using a sine wave regression approach; and (iii) to identify runoff components using classical two-component hydrograph separations on a seasonal timescale. The results show that the isotopic composition of precipitation exhibits marked seasonal variations, which suggests different sources of moisture generation for the rainfall in the study area. The Atlantic-Indian Ocean, Congo basin, Upper White Nile and the Sudd swamps are the potential moisture source areas during the main rainy (summer) season, while the Indian-Arabian and Mediterranean Sea moisture source areas during little rain (spring) and dry (winter) seasons. The spatial variation in the isotopic composition is influenced by the amount effect as depicted by moderate coefficients of determination on a monthly timescale (R-2 varies from 0.38 to 0.68) and weak regression coefficients (R-2 varies from 0.18 to 0.58) for the altitude and temperature effects. A mean altitude effect accounting for -0.12%/100 m for O-18 and -0.58%/100 m for H-2 was discernible in precipitation isotope composition. Results from the hydrograph separation on a seasonal timescale indicate the dominance of event water, with an average of 71 and 64% of the total runoff during the wet season in the Chemoga and Jedeb catchments, respectively. Moreover, the stable isotope compositions of streamflow samples were damped compared to the input function of precipitation for both catchments. This damping was used to estimate mean residence times of stream water of 4.1 and 6.0 months at the Chemoga and Jedeb catchment outlets, respectively. Short mean residence times and high fractions of event water components recommend catchment management measures aiming at reduction of overland flow/soil erosion and increasing of soil water retention and recharge to enable sustainable development in these agriculturally dominated catchments.

AB  - Biofuels policies induce land use changes (LUC), including cropland expansion and crop switching, and this in turn alters water and soil management practices. Policies differ in the extent and type of land use changes they induce and therefore in their impact on water resources. We quantify and compare the spatially varying water impacts of biofuel crops stemming from LUC induced by two different biofuels policies by coupling a biophysical model with an economic model to simulate the economically viable mix of crops, land uses, and crop management choices under alternative policy scenarios. We assess the outputs of an economic model with a high-resolution crop-water model for major agricultural crops and potential cellulosic feedstocks in the US to analyze the impacts of three alternative policy scenarios on water balances: a counterfactual 'no-biofuels policy' (BAU) scenario, a volumetric mandate (Mandate) scenario, and a clean fuel-intensity standard (CFS) scenario incentivizing fuels based on their carbon intensities. While both biofuel policies incentivize more biofuels than in the counterfactual, they differ in the mix of corn ethanol and advanced biofuels from miscanthus and switchgrass (more corn ethanol in Mandate and more cellulosic biofuels in CFS). The two policies differ in their impact on irrigated acreage, irrigation demand, groundwater use and runoff. Net irrigation requirements increase 0.7% in Mandate and decrease 3.8% in CFS, but in both scenarios increases are concentrated in regions of Kansas and Nebraska that rely upon the Ogallala aquifer for irrigation water. Our study illustrates the importance of accounting for the overall LUC and shifts in agricultural production and management practices in response to policies when assessing the water impacts of biofuels.

AB  - The implementation process of the EU water legislation (EU WFD, EU GWD) has put pressure on environmental managers to create, analyse and disseminate hydrological data in recent years. In this context, distributed hydrological model results at the macro scale (>10,000 km(2)) have gained importance for the Environment Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, too. Within a joint project the distributed water balance model GROWA, developed for Germany, has been adapted to Slovenia by re-calibrating the routine for determining the average annual groundwater recharge rate. This routine consists mainly of a base flow index approach (BFI). This BFI is based on 41 different site conditions in Slovenia, whereas lithology dominates the recharge process. This paper outlines the general GROWA approach, the required input data, and the calibration process. Validated model results for the period 1971-2000, especially total runoff and base flow, are presented and discussed. These results have been used already for practical water management issues in Slovenia on European, national and regional level. It is shown that Slovenian groundwater resources exhibit high regional and seasonal variability. Tendencies of more frequent and more pronounced droughts have been detected. As demonstrated by the results GROWA is a valuable tool for the spatially distributed assessment of groundwater recharge in Slovenia.

AB  - Episodic recharge as a result of infrequent, high intensity precipitation events comprises the bulk of groundwater recharge in arid environments. Climate change and shifts in precipitation intensity will affect groundwater continuity, thus altering groundwater recharge. This study aims to identify changes in the ratio of groundwater recharge and precipitation, the R:P ratio, in the arid southwestern United States to characterize observed changes in groundwater recharge attributed to variations in precipitation intensity. Our precipitation metric, precipitation intensity magnification, was used to investigate the relationship between the R:P ratio and precipitation intensity. Our analysis identified significant changes in the R:P ratio concurrent with decreases in precipitation intensity. The results illustrate the importance of precipitation intensity in relation to groundwater recharge in arid regions and provide further insights for groundwater management in nonrenewable groundwater systems and in a changing climate.

AB  - The world's largest aquifers are a fundamental source of freshwater used for agricultural irrigation and to meet human water needs. Therefore, their stored volume of groundwater is linked with water security, which becomes more relevant during periods of drought. This work focuses on understanding large-scale groundwater changes, where we introduce an approach to evaluate groundwater sustainability at a global scale. We employ a groundwater drought index to assess performance metrics (reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and a combined sustainability index) for the largest and most productive global aquifers. Spatiotemporal changes in total water storage are derived from remote sensing observations of gravity anomalies, from which the groundwater drought index is inferred. The results reveal a complex relationship between the indicators, while considering monthly variability in groundwater storage. Combining the drought and sustainability indexes, as presented in this work, constitutes a measure for quantifying groundwater sustainability. This framework integrates changes in groundwater resources due to human influences and climate changes, thus opening a path to assess progress toward sustainable use and water security.

AB  - Sustainable groundwater management requires approaches to assess the influence of climate and management actions on the evolution of groundwater systems. Traditional approaches that apply continuity to assess groundwater sustainability fail to capture the spatial variability of aquifer responses. To address this gap, our study evaluates groundwater elevation data from the Coachella Valley, California, within a groundwater sustainability framework given the adoption of integrative management strategies in the valley. Our study details an innovative approach employing traditional statistical methods to improve understanding of aquifer responses. In this analysis, we evaluate trends at individual groundwater observation wells and regional groundwater behaviors using field significance. Regional elevation trends identified no significant trends during periods of intense groundwater replenishment, active since 1973, despite spatial variability in individual well trends. Our results illustrate the spatially limited effects of groundwater replenishment occur against a setting of long-term groundwater depletion, raising concerns over the definition of sustainable groundwater management in aquifer systems employing integrative management strategies.

AB  - Quantitative approaches to assess the complexity of groundwater drought are hindered by the lack of direct observations of groundwater over space and time. Here, we present an approach to evaluate groundwater drought occurrence based on observations from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Normalized GRACE-derived groundwater storage deviations are shown to quantify groundwater storage deficits during the GRACE record, which we define as the GRACE Groundwater Drought Index (GGDI). As a case study, GGDI is applied over the Central Valley of California, a regional aquifer undergoing intensive human activities and subject to significant drought periods during the GRACE record. Relations between GGDI and other hydrological drought indices highlight our ability to capture drought delays unique to groundwater drought. Further, GGDI captures characteristics of groundwater drought that occur as a result of complex human activities and natural changes, thus presenting a framework to assess multi-driver groundwater drought characteristics.

AB  - Basin-scale groundwater storage trends calculated from long-term streamflow records provide insight into the evolution of watershed behaviors. Our study presents the first spatially relevant validation of recession-based trend approaches by comparing three independent storage trend estimates using GRACE-derived groundwater storage, in situ groundwater elevation observations, and recession-based approaches for the time period of 2003-2015. Results documented consistent agreement between spatially interpolated groundwater observation trends and recession-based storage trends, while GRACE-derived groundwater trends were found to exhibit variable, poor comparisons. A decreasing trend in watershed storage was identified in the southeastern U.S. while increasing trends were identified in the northeast and upper Midwest estimated from recession-based approaches. Our recession-based approach conducted using nested watershed streamflow records identified variable watershed storage trends at scales directly applicable for comparative hydrology studies and for assisting in watershed-based water resources management decisions.

AB  - Hydrological models of three upland sub-catchments of Loch Dee, southwest Scotland, are calibrated and validated against observed discharge. Perturbed precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) are generated from UKCIP09 projections for Low, Medium and High emissions scenarios for the 2050s and 2080s for probability levels between 10 and 90%. Annual and monthly PET increases for all scenarios. Central estimates of increases in annual PET are up to 10.7 (2050s) and 15.8% (2080s). Precipitation becomes more seasonal, increasing in winter and decreasing in summer for all but the extreme probability levels. Annual precipitation declines for the lowest (up to 30%) probability levels and increases thereafter (up to 5.8% for the 2050s and 10.3% for the 2080s at the 50% level). Changes in discharge are driven by those for precipitation. Although there is uncertainty in changes in annual discharge, most scenarios increase winter discharges (2050s: up to 24.2%; 2080s: up to 50.9% at the 50% level) and reduce summer flows (2050s: up to 34.2%, 2080s: up to 48.7% at the 50% level). Potential impacts include enhanced winter flooding and lower summer reservoir levels with implications for hydropower. Greater seasonality in discharge may impact fisheries and ongoing recovery from surface water acidification.

AB  - A semi-distributed hydrological model of the Niger River above and including the Inner Delta is developed. GCM-related uncertainty in climate change impacts are investigated using seven GCMs for a 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature, the hypothesised threshold of dangerous climate change. Declines in precipitation predominate, although some GCMs project increases for some sub-catchments, whilst PET increases for all scenarios. Inter-GCM uncertainty in projected precipitation is three to five times that of PET. With the exception of one GCM (HadGEM1), which projects a very small increase (3.9%), river inflows to the Delta decline. There is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of these reductions, ranging from 0.8% (HadCM3) to 52.7% (IPSL). Whilst flood extent for HadGEM1 increases (mean annual peak +1405km(2)/+10.2%), for other GCMs it declines. These declines range from almost negligible changes to a 7903km(2) (57.3%) reduction in the mean annual peak.

AB  - A semi-distributed hydrological model of the Upper Niger and the Inner Niger Delta is used to investigate the RCP 4.5 scenario for 41 CMIP5 GCMs in the 2050s and 2080s. In percentage terms, the range of change in precipitation is around four times as large as for potential evapotranspiration, which increases for most GCMs over most sub-catchments. Almost equal numbers of subcatchment-GCM combinations experience positive and negative precipitation change. River discharge changes are equally uncertain. Inter-GCM range in mean discharge exceeds that of precipitation by three times in percentage terms. Declining seasonal flooding within the Inner Delta is dominant; 78 and 68% of GCMs project declines in October and November for the 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The 10- and 90-percentile changes in mean annual peak inundation range from -6136 km(2) (-43%) to + 987 km(2) (+7%) for the 2050s and -6176 km(2) (-43%) to +1165 km(2) (+8.2%) for the 2080s.

AB  - Six MIKE SHE models of the Mekong are developed, each employing potential evapotranspiration (PET) derived using alternative methods: Blaney-Criddle (BC), Hamon (HM), Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Linacre (LN), Penman (PN) and Priestley-Taylor (PT). Baseline (1961-1990) PET varies, with PT followed by HS providing the lowest totals, LN and BC the highest. The largest mean annual PET is over 1.5 times the smallest. Independent calibration of each model results in different optimised parameter sets that mitigate differences in baseline PET. Performance of each model is "excellent" (monthly NSE > 0.85) or "very good" (NSE: 0.65-0.85). Scenarios based on seven GCMs for a 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature are investigated. Inter-GCM variation in precipitation change is much larger (in percentage terms by 2.5-10 times) than inter-GCM differences in PET change. Precipitation changes include catchment-wide increases or decreases as well as spatially variable directions of change, whereas PET increases for all scenarios. BC and HS produce the smallest changes, LN and HM the largest. PET method does impact scenario discharges. However, GCM-related uncertainty for change in mean discharge is on average 3.5 times greater than PET method-related uncertainty. Scenarios with catchment-wide precipitation increases (decreases) induce increases (decreases) in mean discharge irrespective of PET method. Magnitude of change in discharge is conditioned by PET method; larger increases or smaller declines in discharge result from methods producing the smallest PET increases. Uncertainty in the direction of change in mean discharge due to PET method occurs for scenarios with spatially variable precipitation change, although this is limited to few gauging stations and differences are relatively small. For all scenarios, PET method-related uncertainty in direction of change in high and low flows occurs, but seasonal distribution of discharge is largely unaffected. As such, whilst PET method does influence projections of discharge, variation in the precipitation climate change signal between GCMs is a much larger source of uncertainty. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Hydrological model-related uncertainty is often ignored within climate change hydrological impact assessments. A MIKE SHE model is developed for the Mekong using the same data as an earlier semi-distributed, conceptual model (SLURP). The model is calibrated and validated using discharge at 12 gauging stations. Two sets of climate change scenarios are investigated. The first is based on a 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature (the hypothesised threshold of 'dangerous' climate change), as simulated by seven GCMs. There are considerable differences in scenario discharge between GCMs, ranging from catchment-wide increases in mean discharge (up to 12.7%; CCCMA CGCM31, NCAR CCSM30), decreases (up to 21.6% in the upper catchments; CSIRO Mk30, IPSL CM4), and spatially varying responses (UKMO HadCM3 and HadGEM1, MPI ECHAM5). Inter-GCM differences are largely driven by differences in precipitation. The second scenario set (HadCM3, increases in global mean temperature of 1-6 degrees C) shows consistently greater discharge (maximum: 28.7%) in the upper catchment as global temperature increases, primarily due to increasing precipitation. Further downstream, discharge is strongly influenced by increasing PET, which outweighs impacts of elevated upstream precipitation and causes consistent discharge reductions for higher temperatures (maximum: -5.3% for the main Mekong). MIKE SHE results for all scenarios are compared with those from the SLURP catchment model and the Mac-PDM.09 global hydrological model. Although hydrological model-related uncertainty is evident, its magnitude is smaller than that associated with choice of GCM. In most cases, the three hydrological models simulate the same direction of change in mean discharge. Mac-PDM.09 simulates the largest discharge increases when they occur, which is responsible for some differences in direction of change at downstream gauging stations for some scenarios, especially HadCM3. Inter-hydrological model differences are likely attributed to alternative model structures, process representations and PET methods (Linacre for MIKE SHE and SLURP, Penman-Monteith for Mac-PDM.09).

AB  - Thirty UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) scenarios are simulated using a MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model of a restored floodplain in eastern England. Annual precipitation exhibits uncertainty in direction of change. Extreme changes (10 and 90% probability) range between -27 and +30%. The central probability projects small declines (<-4%). Wetter winters and drier summers predominate. Potential evapotranspiration increases for most scenarios (annual range of change: -41 to +2%). Declines in mean discharge predominate (range: -41 to +25%). Reductions of 11-17% are projected for the central probability. High and low flows, and the frequency of bankfull discharge exceedence reduce in most cases. Duration of winter high floodplain water tables declines. Summer water tables are on average at least 0.11 and 0.18 m lower for the 2050s and 2080s, respectively. Flood extent declines in most scenarios. Drier conditions will likely induce ecological responses including impacts on floodplain vegetation.

AB  - A MIKE SHE model of the Mekong, calibrated and validated for 12 gauging stations, is used to simulate climate change scenarios associated with a 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature projected by seven general circulation models (GCMs). Impacts of each scenario on the river ecosystem and, hence, uncertainty associated with different GCMs are assessed through an environmental flow method based on the range of variability approach. Ecologically relevant hydrological indicators are evaluated for the baseline and each scenario. Baseline-to-scenario change is assessed against thresholds that define likely risk of ecological impact. They are aggregated into single scores for high and low flows. The results demonstrate considerable inter-GCM differences in risk of change. Uncertainty is larger for low flows, with some GCMs projecting high and medium risk at the majority of locations, and others suggesting widespread no or low risk. Inter-GCM differences occur along the main Mekong, as well as within major tributaries.

AB  - Ecohydrological processes in a water-limited environment are sensitive to both climate conditions and human activities, but the response mechanisms have rarely been explored for large endorheic river basins via an integrated modeling approach. This study established an integrated surface water-groundwater model for the Heihe River Basin (HRB), China's second largest endorheic river basin, using GSFLOW as the modeling platform. Evapotranspiration (ET) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data independently derived from remote sensing products were compared and correlated, respectively, with the modeling results. Scale-dependent interrelationships among ecological, hydrological, and human-impact (i.e., diversion and pumping) variables were revealed through multiple regression analyses. Major study findings include: (1) the independent ET and LAI data enabled the modeler to crosscheck the modeling results from a unique angle not possible with conventional groundwater and streamflow observations; (2) controlling factors for the temporal variability of ET and LAI exhibit notable scale-dependence, reflecting distinctive climate, and human impacts on different land covers; and (3) there exists an intricate linkage between the hydrological regimes in the lower HRB and the middle HRB, essentially equivalent to a tradeoff between the ecosystem health of the lower HRB and the sustainable development of the middle HRB. Overall, the integrated modeling assisted by the independent ET and LAI data has provided a coherent understanding on the regional water cycle, and led to new insights on tackling the existing water conflicts in HRB.

AB  - Disagreement among policymakers often involves policy issues and differences between the decision makers' implicit utility functions. Significant disagreement can also exist concerning conceptual models of the physical system. Disagreement on the validity of a single simulation model delays discussion on policy issues and prevents the adoption of consensus management strategies. For such a contentious situation, the proposed multi-conceptual model optimization (MCMO) can help stakeholders reach a compromise strategy. MCMO computes mathematically optimal strategies that simultaneously satisfy analogous constraints and bounds in multiple numerical models that differ in boundary conditions, hydrogeologic stratigraphy, and discretization. Shadow prices and trade-offs guide the process of refining the first MCMO-developed multi-model strategy into a realistic compromise management strategy. By employing automated cycling, MCMO is practical for linear and nonlinear aquifer systems. In this reconnaissance study, MCMO application to the multilayer Cache Valley (Utah and Idaho, USA) river-aquifer system employs two simulation models with analogous background conditions but different vertical discretization and boundary conditions. The objective is to maximize additional safe pumping (beyond current pumping), subject to constraints on groundwater head and seepage from the aquifer to surface waters. MCMO application reveals that in order to protect the local ecosystem, increased groundwater pumping can satisfy only 40 % of projected water demand increase. To explore the possibility of increasing that pumping while protecting the ecosystem, MCMO clearly identifies localities requiring additional field data. MCMO is applicable to other areas and optimization problems than used here. Steps to prepare comparable sub-models for MCMO use are area-dependent.

AB  - Computational requirements sometimes discourage using mathematical optimization for groundwater management. To dramatically reduce computation time, the presented hybrid response matrix method (RMM), Coefficient Generation and Use method 4 (CGU4), prepares surrogate simulators used during optimization. CGU4 reduces numerical model simulations needed to populate the surrogates (linearized convolution equations, LCEs). LCEs often represent flow and head constraints within groundwater flow optimization problems. CGU4 reduces computations for problems having: varying time period sizes; eras of sequential time periods of equal duration; and system (non) linearity. For a situation having: linear, piece-wise, and nonlinear groundwater flows; 20 periods of varying and sequentially constant durations; and optimization problems employing (non) linear objective functions and linear head and aquifersurface seepage constraints, CGU4 requires 22-61% fewer simulations to compute optimal objective function values within 0.001-0.003% of the best alternative RMM. For hypothetical (non) linear dynamic stream-aquifer problems, CGU4 required the same or 63-89% less time than previous RMMs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The magnitude and timing of deep drainage and salt leaching through clay soils is a critical issue for dryland agriculture in semi-arid regions (< 500 mm yr(-1) rainfall, potential evapotranspiration > 2000 mm yr(-1)) such as parts of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). In this rare study, hydrogeological measurements and estimations of the historic water balance of crops grown on overlying Grey Vertosols were combined to estimate the contribution of deep drainage below crop roots to recharge and salinization of shallow groundwater. Soil sampling at two sites on the alluvial flood plain of the Lower Namoi catchment revealed significant peaks in chloride concentrations at 0.8-1.2 m depth under perennial vegetation and at 2.0-2.5 m depth under continuous cropping indicating deep drainage and salt leaching since conversion to cropping. Total salt loads of 91-229 t ha(-1) NaCl equivalent were measured for perennial vegetation and cropping, with salinity to >= 10 m depth that was not detected by shallow soil surveys. Groundwater salinity varied spatially from 910 to 2430 mS m(-1) at 21 to 37 m depth (N = 5), whereas deeper groundwater was less saline (290 mS m(-1)) with use restricted to livestock and rural domestic supplies in this area. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) software package predicted deep drainage of 3.3-9.5 mm yr(-1) (0.7-2.1% rainfall) based on site records of grain yields, rainfall, salt leaching and soil properties. Predicted deep drainage was highly episodic, dependent on rainfall and antecedent soil water content, and over a 39 yr period was restricted mainly to the record wet winter of 1998. During the study period, groundwater levels were unresponsive to major rainfall events (70 and 190 mm total), and most piezometers at about 18 m depth remained dry. In this area, at this time, recharge appears to be negligible due to low rainfall and large potential evapotranspiration, transient hydrological conditions after changes in land use and a thick clay dominated vadose zone. This is in contrast to regional groundwater modelling that assumes annual recharge of 0.5% of rainfall. Importantly, it was found that leaching from episodic deep drainage could not cause discharge of saline groundwater in the area, since the water table was several meters below the incised river bed.

AB  - The objective of this research is to develop a fuzzy-based groundwater sustainability index (FGSI) model to evaluate the sustainability of groundwater system at selected cities in Asian. The new Mamdani type fuzzy-based inference system known as FGSI was developed. It contains five components and twenty-four indicators, which covers five dimensions of sustainability, namely, environmental, social, economic, mutual trust, and institutional. The FGSI model offers a novel combination of indicators, which covers aspects of groundwtaer quality, quantity, and management. An attempt was made to develop a robust index for estimating the groundwater sustainability. The model was evaluated for selected cities in Asian with different difuzzification methods, and compared with the conventional method. The centroid defuzzification method produced well diversified results compared with other methods, including conventional method. The overall groundwater sustainability of Hyderabad of India was estimated as highly sustainable and, Lahore of Pakistan, Bangkok of Thailand, Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam and Yangon City of Myanmar were estimated as moderately sustainable. The FGSI model may help to policy and decision makers to provide a reliable and resilient sustainable management system in the cities by identifying the indicators for the improvement.

AB  - Chahardouly basin is located in the western part of Iran and is characterized by semi-arid climatic conditions and scarcity in water resources. The main aquifer systems are developed within alluvial deposits. The availability of groundwater is rather erratic owing to the occurrence of hard rock formation and a saline zone in some parts of the area. The aquifer systems of the area show signs of depletion, which have taken place in recent years due to a decline in water levels. Groundwater samples collected from shallow and deep wells were analysed to examine the quality characteristics of groundwater. The major ion chemistry of groundwater is dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3- while higher values of total dissolved solids (TDS) in groundwater are associated with high concentrations of all major ions. An increase in salinity is recorded in the down-gradient part of the basin. The occurrence of saline groundwater, as witnessed by the high electrical conductivity (EC), may be attributed to the long residence time of water and the dissolution of minerals, as well as evaporation of rainfall and irrigation return flow. Based on SAR values and sodium content (%Na), salinity appears to be responsible for the poor groundwater quality, rendering most of the samples not suitable for irrigation use.

AB  - The Bahar aquifer is one of the most economically important aquifers in the western part of Iran, covering the water demands for irrigation supplies. Intensive pumping for irrigation has caused a water table decline. The local water organisation has constructed a water storage structure to augment the groundwater resources. Groundwater recharge using water from the river via 13 dug wells and a related structure has been estimated as 2.7 million m(3), for the hydrological year 2002-2003. A three-dimensional model was developed to predict the aquifer system response. The effect of radial flow was found to be 4 km, and the area covering this recharge more than 40 km(2). The results of the numerical model could be used by local authorities and decision makers for groundwater resources management and planning. Finally, it is concluded that aquifer recharge is one environmental solution, as a part of integral water resources management. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The method is based on constructing a highly parameterized base model, calculating base parameter sensitivities, and decomposing the base parameter normal matrix into eigenvectors representing principal orthogonal directions in parameter space. The decomposition is used to construct super parameters. Super parameters are factors by which principal eigenvectors of the base parameter normal matrix are multiplied in order to minimize a composite least squares objective function. These eigenvectors define orthogonal axes of a parameter subspace for which information is available from the calibration data. The coordinates of the solution are sought within this subspace. Super parameters are estimated using a regularized nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg scheme. Though super parameters are estimated, Tikhonov regularization constraints are imposed on base parameters. Tikhonov regularization mitigates over fitting and promotes the estimation of reasonable base parameters. Use of a large number of base parameters enables the inversion process to be receptive to the information content of the calibration data, including aspects pertaining to small-scale parameter variations. Because the number of super parameters sustainable by the calibration data may be far less than the number of base parameters used to define the original problem, the computational burden for solution of the inverse problem is reduced. The hybrid methodology is described and applied to a simple synthetic groundwater flow model. It is then applied to a real-world groundwater flow and contaminant transport model. The approach and programs described are applicable to a range of modeling disciplines.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of Cl-36 in tracing young groundwater with residence times of up to similar to 50 years. Groundwater samples were obtained from 16 irrigation wells in paddy fields located within an upland-lowland system in the Yoro River basin, Central Japan. The Cl-36/Cl ratios were in the range of 17 to 362 x 10(-15). Among the samples with higher Cl- concentrations (> 10 mg/L), two samples showed high nitrate concentrations as well (> 30 mg/L). Except for these samples, the distribution of Cl-36 in groundwater was essentially consistent with previous tritium concentration data measured in 1982 and 1994, considering the time that has elapsed since these earlier measurements

AB  - In the paper, a new transboundary Upper Pannonian thermal groundwater body was identified which extends over 22,128 km(2) in Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia. The presented joint numerical simulation of freshwater and geothermal aquifers in the Pannonian sedimentary basin and weathered basement rocks provided new insights into the regional water balance and cross-border groundwater flow rates. It is highlighted that predominant thermal water flow directions in the pre-exploitation state were from Hungary to Austria, and from Slovenia and Slovakia to Hungary. The study, intended to simulate changes in regional flow patterns, revealed that the current production rates of thermal water dramatically decreased the cross-border flows in all cases, and even reversed the flow direction to be now from Hungary to Slovakia. Simulated drawdowns at the state borders ate in the range of 2-10 m, and they penetrate far into the neighboring countries. The expected future production, if increased for a factor of 3.5, should maintain the regional drawdown below 30 m; however, flow reversals would occur. Although the current regional exploitation cannot be called unsustainable, the quantity status of some geothermal aquifers is deteriorating locally and demands fast management actions. The joint transboundary management should focus on regular exchange of information, on increasing energy efficiency, and on obligatory use of geothermal doublets for geothermal heat production.

AB  - Relatively little is known about the impact of climate change on groundwater. The analysis of large-scale climatic patterns such as the well-known El Nino Southern Oscillation Index could provide a better comprehension of the causes of recharge variations in aquifers and therefore improve the knowledge related to processes behind the variability of groundwater level time series. This topic has been studied to a limited extent in other parts of the world, but no study has yet used this approach across Canada. In this work, correlation and wavelet analyses and wavelet coherence are used to gain a broader understanding of the interannual dynamics of recharge through the use of groundwater level records in three Canadian regions, namely Prince Edward Island (PEI), southern Manitoba in the vicinity of Winnipeg (MB) and Vancouver Island (VI). Cause and effect linkages between four climatic indices (the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the Pacific-North American pattern (PNA) and the El Nino Southern Oscillation represented by the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI)), groundwater level time series, as well as precipitation and temperature time series are investigated. The length of the available historical records of groundwater levels at the three sites is 32 years (1974-2005). The three Canadian regions studied show drastically different patterns of variability evolution for the hydrogeological records. Groundwater level variability on PEI is mostly influenced by the NAO and the AO. The variability of groundwater levels in the MB region is partly explained by PNA. In the VI region, NAO, AO and MEI appear to impact the pattern of groundwater variability. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The successful management of groundwater dependent shallow seasonal wetlands requires a sound understanding of groundwater fluxes. However, such fluxes are hard to quantify. Water volume and solute mass balance models can be used in order to derive an estimate of groundwater fluxes within such systems. This approach is particularly attractive, as it can be undertaken using measurable environmental variables, such as; rainfall, evaporation, pond level and salinity. Groundwater fluxes estimated from such an approach are subject to uncertainty in the measured variables as well as in the process representation and in parameters within the model. However, the shallow nature of seasonal wetland ponds means water volume and surface area can change rapidly and non-linearly with depth, requiring an accurate representation of the wetland pond bathymetry. Unfortunately, detailed bathymetry is rarely available and simplifying assumptions regarding the bathymetry have to be made. However, the implications of these assumptions are typically not quantified. We systematically quantify the uncertainty implications for eight different representations of wetland bathymetry for a shallow seasonal wetland pond in South Australia. The predictive uncertainty estimation methods provided in the Model-Independent Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis software (PEST) are used to quantify the effect of bathymetric uncertainty on the modelled fluxes. We demonstrate that bathymetry can be successfully represented within the model in a simple parametric form using a cubic Sexier curve, allowing an assessment of bathymetric uncertainty due to measurement error and survey detail on the derived groundwater fluxes compared with the fixed bathymetry models. Findings show that different bathymetry conceptualisations can result in very different mass balance components and hence process conceptualisations, despite equally good fits to observed data, potentially leading to poor management decisions for the wetlands. Model predictive uncertainty increases with the crudity of the bathymetry representation, however, approximations that capture the general shape of the wetland pond such as a power law or Bezier curve show only a small increase in prediction uncertainty compared to the full dGPS surveyed bathymetry, implying these may be sufficient for most modelling purposes.

AB  - The Loess Plateau of China (LPC) is suffering from the impacts of overexploitation of groundwater, leading to a decline in the regional water table. This is compounded by relatively recent large-scale transformation of land use, which may impact groundwater recharge and threaten future water quality from intensive nitrogen fertilizer application. Understanding the regional unsaturated water flow and nitrate travel time in the deep vadose zone is crucial for the sustainable management of the LPC groundwater system. We develop here a regional-scale model that exploits an extensive database of soil properties derived from recent intensive soil profile sampling over the LPC, together with climate, vadose zone thickness, and land use data. The model solves the Richards equation and a conservative solute transport model using a multiple 1D column approach. A comparison between model simulations and observations at five sites reveals good model performance. Application over the LPC indicates that areas with dense irrigated agricultural land use contribute significantly to groundwater recharge. By using land use cover information from 1975 to 2008, simulations reveal that the transition from agriculture to forest and grassland accounts for a small reduction of the total annual recharge (6.1%). Modeled nitrate travel times through the deep unsaturated zone range between decades and centuries; however, recent loading of anthropogenic nitrate is expected to reach the aquifer in the near future under irrigated areas or where the vadose zone is relatively thin. The model simulations provide valuable information for assessing future vulnerability of groundwater resources over a regional scale.

AB  - The groundwater irrigation expansion, and its multiple potential impacts on the quantity and quality of water resources, is not just restricted to areas that are water limited. In this studywe present the seasonal impacts irrigation practices can have on groundwater resources in a temperate humid region, where the average annual rain/PET ratio is 1.0. In this system the irrigation expansion is solely supported by groundwater pumping, but despite this only 5 boreholes are monitored for hydraulic head data. In this study, we compensate the scarce hydrophysical dataset by incorporating environmental tracers (major ions, delta O-18, delta H-2 and delta C-13) and dating tracers (H-3, CFC, SF6 and C-14). Results indicate that at 9 of the 15 irrigation sites investigated, groundwater pumping for irrigation has induced the mixing of recent groundwater (up to <1 year) with older waters. The origin of the older waters was from either the deeper marl aquifer, or the shallow sand-clay aquifer (SCB) that has a C-14 mean residence time (MRT) of up to 9700 years. Secondly, although high nitrate loads in infiltrating waters were being diverted via the artificial subsurface drainage system, increases in fertiliser loads have resulted in higher NO3 concentrations in younger groundwater (NO3: 9-45 mg/L, MRT <20 years), comparedwith older groundwater (NO3 <= 9mg/L, MRT N 20 years). The changes in flow pathways, induced by irrigation, also results in seasonal declines in groundwater NO3 concentrations due to mixing with olderwaters. In temperate humid areas, such evaluations of the seasonal evolution of water residence time, mixing process, and agrochemical contaminants are an important contribution to real water resources management in irrigated catchments.

AB  - This paper introduces a new index to test water resource sustainability in regions where groundwater is the main source of water supply. The Spatial Water Use efficiency Index (SWUI) is a geographical information system (GIS) environment index which expresses the ratio of potential available water volume (groundwater recharge minus water needs) to the respective water needs. Its low and/or negative values indicate water stress. SWUI is applied in the island of Crete, Greece, where water needs are mainly covered by groundwater abstractions. The annual water mass balance is estimated using the RIBASIM (River Basin Simulation) model. The total freshwater needs in the Cretan region reach 535hm(3) annually according to the model's simulation. SWUI with values ranging from -0.8 to 214.3 has proved to be an important visual tool towards depicting the low efficiency of the east part of the island to cover water demand and a useful decision-making tool in the sustainability evaluation of groundwater aquifers.

AB  - A weighted multi-criteria decision-making framework was designed to identify and prioritize areas for monitoring aquifer hydraulic heads within the Victoria County Groundwater Conservation District. The criteria address salient hydrogeological aspects including groundwater variability, recharge, surface water-groundwater interactions, and groundwater fluxes across district boundaries. Texas water statutes require groundwater conservation districts to quantify these factors and utilize them to manage aquifers. A stakeholder survey instrument was used to prioritize these criteria. A monitoring priority index (MPI), whose value theoretically ranges between 0 and 1 was computed as a weighted average of six mutually exclusive criteria. The MPI value was seen to range between 0.2 and 0.6 within the study area. Lower values of MPI indicate areas where the current level of monitoring is adequate and areas with a higher MPI point to locations where additional monitoring is necessary. In particular, monitoring along district boundaries, particularly along the western and southern sections, is recommended. The developed methodology was seen to provide a transparent and simple-to-use approach to identify and prioritize areas within the district for the purposes of groundwater monitoring. The proposed framework demonstrates the utility of GIS in facilitating a scientifically credible and stakeholder-driven approach for establishing groundwater monitoring networks and can be adapted in other similar applications.

AB  - Epistemic uncertainties arise during the estimation of hydraulic gradients in unconfined aquifers due to planar approximation of the water table as well as data gaps arising from factors such as instrument failures and site inaccessibility. A multidimensional fuzzy least-squares regression approach is proposed here to estimate hydraulic gradients in situations where epistemic uncertainty is present in the observed water table measurements. The hydraulic head at a well is treated as a normal (Gaussian) fuzzy variable characterized by a most likely value and a spread. This treatment results in hydraulic gradients being characterized as normal fuzzy numbers as well. The multidimensional fuzzy least-squares regression has an exact analytical form and as such can be implemented easily using matrix algebra methods. However, the method was noted to be sensitive to round-off and truncation errors when the epistemic uncertainties are small. A closeness index based on the cardinality of a fuzzy number is used to evaluate how well the regression model fits the fuzzy hydraulic head observations. A fuzzy Euclidian distance measure is used to compare two fuzzy numbers and to evaluate how fuzziness in the observed hydraulic heads affects the fuzziness in the estimated hydraulic gradients. The Euclidian distance measure is also used to ascertain the influence of each well on the fuzzy hydraulic gradient estimation. The fuzzy regression framework is illustrated by applying it to evaluate hydraulic gradients in the unconfined portion of the Gulf Coast aquifer in Goliad County, TX. The results from the case-study indicate that there is greater uncertainty associated with the estimation of the hydraulic gradients in the vertical (Z-axis) direction. The epistemic uncertainties in the hydraulic head data at the wells have a significant impact on the gradient estimates when they are of the same order of magnitude as the most likely values of the observed heads. The influence analysis indicated that 5 of the 13 wells in the network had a critical influence on at least one of the hydraulic gradients. Three wells along the northeastern section of the study area and bordering the Victoria County were noted to have the least influence on the regression estimates. The fuzzy regression framework along with the associated goodness-of-fit and influence measures provides a useful set of tools to characterize the uncertainties in the hydraulic heads and gradients arising from data gaps and planar water table approximation.

AB  - Groundwater reliant and agriculturally dominant environments (GRADEs) utilize exhaustible aquifer resources to supply food and fiber demands. The sustainability of these GRADES is threatened by over-exploitation of fresher groundwater resources. There is an interest in exploring deeper brackish groundwater resources to sustain agricultural based economies in these regions. Using the southern high plains of Texas (SHP) as a test-bed, the interlinkages between food-energy-water on improving water resiliency through brackish groundwater development is explored. Three scenarios(1) direct use of deeper formations; (2) blending deeper and shallower groundwaters and 3) desalination of blended resources were evaluated in a spatially explicit manner. The results indicate that direct reuse of deeper water is possible over 30% of the study area, but it is not available in areas of critical need. The parameters limiting the suitability of deeper groundwater for agriculture in the order of decreasing importance are EC > TDS > SAR > B > Na > Cl. Simple blending of water from deeper and shallower aquifers improve water quality over roughly 900,000 acres. While blending greatly reduces the specific ion toxicities caused by sodium absorption ratio (SAR) and boron (B), the limitations of total dissolved solids (TDS) cannot be overcome. The over-burden pressures in the deeper confined aquifer somewhat alleviate the blending energy requirements, especially in the southern portions of SHP. Desalination increases the energy requirements by several fold and is not suitable to sustain current agricultural practices which are focused mostly on lower valued staple crops. Using desalinated water for municipal and industrial uses can help ameliorate the stresses on the Ogallala Aquifer and enhance its longevity. (C) 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Water is a vital resource for the survival of not only human population, but also almost all ecosystems. Constituting 30 % of all freshwater, groundwater is the main source of available freshwater. Coastal aquifers, which serve as the major freshwater source for densely populated zones, are of vital importance and quite vulnerable to climate change. This paper examines the significant consequences of climate change, decreasing recharge rates, sea-level rise and increasing freshwater demand on the sustainable management of coastal aquifers, via a hypothetical case study. A 3-D numerical model is developed using SEAWAT, to simulate a circular island aquifer in the form of a freshwater lens surrounded by saltwater. Issues such as sloping land surface resulting in landward migration of the coastal boundary and transient response of the system due to pumping are considered through a set of predictive simulations. To assess the sensitivity of the model results to important parameters, a sensitivity analysis is performed. Results of this research, revealing the effects of mentioned pressures on the long-term sustainability of the freshwater resource, are evaluated on the basis of groundwater reserves and intrusion of the freshwater-saltwater interface in lateral and vertical directions. These outcomes are further used to determine the sustainable pumping rate of the system, considering both quantity and quality of the groundwater resources.

AB  - Education on the subject of groundwater is crucial for sustainability. Nevertheless, international studies with students across different age groups have shown that the basic hydrogeological concept of groundwater defined as water within porous and permeable rocks is not an established everyday notion. Drawing from international research, a multimedia learning program Zwischen Regenwolke und Wasserhahn (between the rain cloud and the tap) was developed, which incorporates specific insights from the fields of conceptual change research, multimedia research, and the model of educational reconstruction. The effectiveness of the learning program was ascertained by means of two studies with Austrian seventh grade pupils as well as teacher-training students from the fields of biology and geography in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the learning program. Using a quasi-experimental research design, the participants' conceptions and knowledge of groundwater were determined in a pre- and post-test. The pupils and students greatly benefitted from working through the learning software independently. Their knowledge of groundwater increased significantly compared to the control group and there was a highly significant increase in the number of scientifically correct notions of groundwater. The acceptance of the program was also generally very high. The results indicate that theory-guided multimedia learning programs can play an important role in the transfer of research results to classroom settings, especially in science education.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) seems to be related to the temperature of shallow aquifers and the unsaturated zone thickness (Delta Z(uz)). That relationship is valid when the study area fulfils certain characteristics: a) there should be no downward moisture fluxes in an unsaturated zone, b) the soil composition in terms of both, the different horizon materials and their corresponding thermal and hydraulic properties, must be as homogeneous and isotropic as possible, c) flat and regular topography, and d) steady state groundwater temperature with a spatially homogeneous temperature distribution. A night time Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image and temperature field measurements are used to test the validity of the relationship between LST and Delta Z(uz) at the Pampa del Tamarugal, which is located in the Atacama Desert (Chile) and meets the above required conditions. The results indicate that there is a relation between the land surface temperature and the unsaturated zone thickness in the study area. Moreover, the field measurements of soil temperature indicate that shallow aquifers dampen both the daily and the seasonal amplitude of the temperature oscillation generated by the local climate conditions. Despite empirically observing the relationship between the LST and Delta Z(uz) in the study zone, such a relationship cannot be applied to directly estimate Delta Z(uz) using temperatures from nighttime thermal satellite images. To this end, it is necessary to consider the soil thermal properties, the soil surface roughness and the unseen water and moisture fluxes (e.g., capillarity and evaporation) that typically occur in the subsurface.

AB  - The hyper-arid conditions prevailing in Agua Verde aquifer in northern Chile make this system the most important water source for nearby towns and mining industries. Due to the growing demand for water in this region, recharge is investigated along with the impact of intense pumping activity in this aquifer. A conceptual model of the hydrogeological system is developed and implemented into a two-dimensional groundwater-flow numerical model. To assess the impact of climate change and groundwater extraction, several scenarios are simulated considering variations in both aquifer recharge and withdrawals. The estimated average groundwater lateral recharge from Precordillera (pre-mountain range) is about 4,482 m(3)/day. The scenarios that consider an increase of water withdrawal show a non-sustainable groundwater consumption leading to an over-exploitation of the resource, because the outflows surpasses inflows, causing storage depletion. The greater the depletion, the larger the impact of recharge reduction caused by the considered future climate change. This result indicates that the combined effects of such factors may have a severe impact on groundwater availability as found in other groundwater-dependent regions located in arid environments. Furthermore, the scenarios that consider a reduction of the extraction flow rate show that it may be possible to partially alleviate the damage already caused to the aquifer by the continuous extractions since 1974, and it can partially counteract climate change impacts on future groundwater availability caused by a decrease in precipitation (and so in recharge), if the desalination plant in Taltal increases its capacity.

AB  - Volumetric pricing as envisaged within the Water Framework Directive (60/2000) is a considerable challenge in terms of irrigation in Mediterranean regions, since a large share of the water source is groundwater. Enforcing this pricing scheme involves systematic metering and control (M&C) systems with subsequent high costs. This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature related to the assessment of costs for the metering and control of irrigation groundwater. The full operational cost of all activities related to the hypothetical services provided by a public agency is assessed for Apulia (a region in southern Italy). The results show that point-to-point metering services are quite costly, ranging from 38.5 to 59 euros per delivery point. New questions arise regarding whether the M&C of groundwater abstraction should be fully charged to end users (i.e., farmers), or also shared with the whole society as a public service aimed at environmental enhancement.

AB  - One of the potential dangers that might arise as a result of bringing excessive amounts of groundwater to the surface of the Earth is land subsidence. Such surface deformations - these velocities may vary from a few millimetres to a few metres per year - do the greatest damage to infrastructure facilities and buildings in residential units. Agricultural lands, in which excessive irrigation is performed, and densely populated cities are more likely to suffer from land subsidence. Konya Closed Basin (KCB), where a rapid groundwater withdrawal has been observed during the last 30-40 years, is faced with such a threat. In this study, the possibility of the occurrence of land subsidence, related to groundwater withdrawal for the KCB, is assessed and the geodetic studies conducted up to now, with the intention of identifying land subsidence, are introduced. The vertical displacements of between -12 and -52 mm/year have been detected through GNSS observations collected on the 6-point test network. The land subsidence phenomenon has been developing in the areas where the groundwater is extensively used for irrigation and daily life. The results support the findings derived from the historical leveling records and point out the need of an extended study based on both GNSS and InSAR techniques for spatial and temporal mapping of land subsidence in the KCB.

AB  - This paper deals with the assessment of sustainability in the exploitation of groundwater by agriculture in arid and semi-arid lands. The procedure proposed is not based on an indicator made up of a few partial, static figures, but on one which requires the use of all the information collectable for the system under assessment. This information serves to calibrate a dynamic model which formalizes the main causal chains and feedbacks existing between hydrogeology and the number of farms, this being ultimately linked to farms economy. The risk of overexploitation is worked out as the percentage of model's long-term steady-states, associated to a great number of different scenarios, surpassing some chosen threshold marking out sustainability from degradation. The procedure has been implemented for two study cases: the Eastern La Mancha aquifer (Spain), where information was abundant, and the Oued-Mird alluvial aquifer (Morocco), where quantitative information was so much scarcer. Significant risks of degradation have been found in both cases, especially in the Moroccan one. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of non-conventional water (e.g., treated wastewater, desalinated water) for different purposes is increasing in many water scarce regions of the world. Its use for irrigation may have potential drawbacks, because of mineral dissolution/precipitation processes, such as changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties (e.g., porosity, permeability), modifying infiltration and aquifer recharge processes or blocking root growth. Prediction of soil and groundwater impacts is essential for achieving sustainable agricultural practices. A numerical model to solve unsaturated water flow and non-isothermal multicomponent reactive transport has been modified implementing the spatio-temporal evolution of soil physical and hydraulic properties. A long-term process simulation (30 years) of agricultural irrigation with desalinated water, based on a calibrated/validated 1D numerical model in a semi-arid region, is presented. Different scenarios conditioning reactive transport (i.e., rainwater irrigation, lack of gypsum in the soil profile, and lower partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2))) have also been considered. Results show that although boundary conditions and mineral soil composition highly influence the reactive processes, dissolution/precipitation of carbonate species is triggered mainly by pCO(2), closely related to plant roots. Calcite dissolution occurs in the root zone, precipitation takes place under it and at the soil surface, which will lead a root growth blockage and a direct soil evaporation decrease, respectively. For the studied soil, a gypsum dissolution up to 40 cm depth is expected at long-term, with a general increase of porosity and hydraulic conductivity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sophisticated research and management problems of the Estonian water environment are considered by means of holistic modelling. The model elaborated is based on the computer code Visual MODFLOW Classic. The model encompasses the entire Estonian Artesian Basin (EAB) and the border districts of Russia and Latvia. It involves all main aquifers and aquitards on an area of 88,000 km(2). The main hydrogeological and hydrological characteristics of the study area, including the time-dependent three-dimensional distribution of groundwater heads, the direction, velocity and rate of subsurface fluxes, itemised water budgets, volumes of hydrogeological units, and durations of groundwater exchange have been determined by modelling. The palaeohydrological situation during the last continental glaciation of the EAB was reconstructed and the principal problems of the sustainable management of water environment were elucidated. The model has been used to simulate the local and cumulative rates of the base flow.

AB  - Management of groundwater resources can be improved by using groundwater models to perform risk analyses and to improve development strategies, but a lack of extensive basic data often limits the implementation of sophisticated models. Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is an example of a city where increasing groundwater use in a Pleistocene aquifer is causing groundwater-related problems such as saline intrusion along the coastline, lowering of water-table levels, and contamination of pumping wells. The lack of a water-level monitoring network introduces a problem for basic data collection and model calibration and validation. As a replacement, local water-supply wells were used for measuring groundwater depth, and well-top heights were estimated from a regional digital elevation model to recalculate water depths to hydraulic heads. These were used to draw a regional piezometric map. Hydraulic parameters were estimated from short-time pumping tests in the local wells, but variation in hydraulic conductivity was attributed to uncertainty in well characteristics (information often unavailable) and not to aquifer heterogeneity. A MODFLOW model was calibrated with a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field and a sensitivity analysis between the conductivity and aquifer recharge showed that average annual recharge will likely be in the range 80-100 mm/year.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions irrigation is usually needed to provide enough water for crop growth in cultivated areas. As surface waters are scarce, especially in summertime when the water is needed, groundwater is heavily used to supply the water demand. Overexploitation of the aquifer in dry years causes depletion of the groundwater storage and systematical lowering of the piezometric levels. This is a particular problem in aquifers developed in closed basins where lateral inflow is nearly absent and replenishment is constrained by rainfall recharge. In this paper, simple indicators derived from meteorological data, abstraction rates and piezometric time series are compared with the groundwater storage depletion as obtained from a calibrated groundwater flow model. Application of the method to the overexploited Shahrekord basin in Iran shows that for the simulated period 1989-2003 an accumulative index of the difference of aquifer recharge, as calculated by a soil moisture balance method, and groundwater abstraction has a correlation coefficient of nearly one with model calculated storage. Indicators based on the filling index derived from piezometric time series or on the ratio of aquifer discharge to recharge have slightly lower correlations. The accumulated index indicator can be used to follow aquifer storage in the future without the need to run the full groundwater flow model. This simple approximation is restricted to aquifer systems with a limited lateral inflow and outflow. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantitative insight into the impact of land use on groundwater composition is vital for the sustainable management of aquifers, especially those situated in urban areas. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of land use on groundwater composition throughout the Netherlands, relative to the influence of groundwater age, groundwater origin, and geochemical processes. Using a nationwide dataset on shallow groundwater from the Dutch National Groundwater-Monitoring Network, land-use effects were quantified statistically for all major ionic substances. Analysis of variance was applied to the entire dataset, to a priori groups based on groundwater age, and to nona priori statistical clusters determined by fuzzy c-means clustering. The results indicated that the effect of land use on groundwater composition in the Netherlands strongly depends on geochemical processes and groundwater age. Land-use effects were most pronounced in younger, geochemically less-evolved groundwater: for example, urban areas showed an increase in Ca, Na, Cl, and HCO3 by a factor 2-4, an increase in K and B by a factor 4-10, and a decrease in At by a factor 10 compared to natural areas. Similarly, agricultural areas showed an increase in Ca, NO3, and Fe by a factor 2-4, an increase in K by a factor 4-10, and a decrease in Al by a factor 2. Compared to urban areas, agricultural areas contained less Na, Cl, and At and more NO3. Our results demonstrate that the importance of the processes controlling groundwater composition in the Netherlands is scale-dependent, with geochemical processes being more dominant on a national scale and land use on regional and local scales.

AB  - A negotiation support system (NSS) was developed to solve groundwater conflicts that arose during land-use management. It was set up in cooperation with the stakeholders involved to provide information on the impact of land use, e.g., agriculture, nature (forested areas), recreation, and urban areas, on the quality of both infiltrating and abstracted groundwater. This NSS combined simulation programs that calculate (1) the concentrations of nitrate in shallow groundwater for each land-use area and (2) the transport of nitrate in the groundwater-saturated zone. The user interface of the NSS enabled scenario analyses. The NSS was validated at a drinking-water abstraction near Holten (the Netherlands) using a spatial planning process aimed at sustainable land-use and groundwater-resource management. Two land-use scenarios were considered: a base scenario reflecting the autonomous development and an adapted land-use scenario. The calculated results for shallow groundwater provided an explicit spatial overview of the impact of historical land use and N application on the quality of abstracted groundwater as well as insight into the impact of changes in land use and N application. Visualization of the conflicting interests of agriculture and the drinking-water abstraction helped all stakeholders accept the necessary changes in land use identified by the adapted land-use scenario of the NSS. These changes were included in the preferred Land-use management option in the regional planning process, which has since been formalized. The NSS provided system insight, scoping analyses, and education, in addition to generating quantitative information on the impact of land-use functions on groundwater quality. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Surface water resources (the Vaal River and its tributaries) in the Vredefort Dome World Heritage Site (VDWHS), South Africa, have been over extended and future development will rely solely on groundwater. Hence, being at a critical point in the water balance, groundwater resources in the VDWHS require careful management and protection to ensure sustainability and equitable access. An assessment of the geohydrological character of the VDWHS was therefore done in order to develop a groundwater resource management plan. Five groundwater resource management units were delineated and resource measures for each management unit were developed based on physical and anthropogenic attributes. Due to the importance of groundwater in the VDWHS, it was determined that geohydrology should play a major role in the alignment of the environmental, spatial and statutory development frameworks, in order to ensure good governance. A geohydrological-based land use management guideline and spatial development framework was developed to optimize the integration between the water sector, the environmental sector and land use and spatial planning sector. It was concluded that a geohydrological assessment needs to form the basis of all future land use management and spatial planning activities in the VDWHS.

AB  - Rainwater harvesting (RWH), the small-scale collection and storage of runoff for irrigated agriculture, is recognized as a sustainable strategy for ensuring food security, especially in monsoonal landscapes in the developing world. In south India, these strategies have been used for millennia to mitigate problems of water scarcity. However, in the past 100 years many traditional RWH systems have fallen into disrepair due to increasing dependence on groundwater. This dependence has contributed to accelerated decline in groundwater resources, which has in turn led to increased efforts at the state and national levels to revive older RWH systems. Critical to the success of such efforts is an improved understanding of how these ancient systems function in contemporary landscapes with extensive groundwater pumping and shifted climatic regimes. Knowledge is especially lacking regarding the water-exchange dynamics of these RWH tanks at tank and catchment scales, and how these exchanges regulate tank performance and catchment water balances. Here, we use fine-scale, water-level variation to quantify daily fluxes of groundwater, evapotranspiration (ET), and sluice outflows in four tanks over the 2013 northeast monsoon season in a tank cascade that covers a catchment area of 28 km(2). At the tank scale, our results indicate that groundwater recharge and irrigation outflows comprise the largest fractions of the tank water budget, with ET accounting for only 13-22% of the outflows. At the scale of the cascade, we observe a distinct spatial pattern in groundwater-exchange dynamics, with the frequency and magnitude of groundwater inflows increasing down the cascade of tanks. The significant magnitude of return flows along the tank cascade leads to the most downgradient tank in the cascade having an outflow-to-capacity ratio greater than 2. At the catchment scale, the presence of tanks in the landscape dramatically alters the catchment water balance, with runoff decreasing by nearly 75%, and recharge increasing by more than 40%. Finally, while water from the tanks directly satisfies similar to 40% of the crop water requirement across the northeast monsoon season via surface water irrigation, a large fraction of the tank water is 'wasted', and more efficient management of sluice outflows could lead to tanks meeting a higher fraction of crop water requirements.

AB  - Groundwater levels in the North China Plain (NCP), the bread basket of China, have dropped more than one meter per year over the last 40 years, putting at risk the long term productivity of this region. Groundwater decline is most severe in the Alluvial Fans where our study site is located. Avoiding a foreseeable systems collapse requires region-wide changes in crop systems management, underpinned by sound environmental policies. Here, we explore the potential of crop system adaptation to remedy the excessive water use and quantify the likely yield penalties associated with more sustainable water use practices. Using simulations with the APSIM cropping systems model we explore production opportunities in an area within the NCP with intensive cropping and no access to irrigation from rivers. We estimate the attainable production levels for wheat and maize if agriculture were made groundwater neutral, through changes in crop sequence, irrigation practices and water conservation technologies (e.g. mulching with plastic film). Total grain production would drop by 44% compared to current practice if agriculture were made groundwater neutral. Water conservation by plastic film could limit this reduction to 21-33% but possible environmental impacts of plastic film need attention. This analysis facilitates a much needed debate on alternative agronomic practices and incentives through a quantitative comparison of adaptation options. Our biophysical analysis needs to be complemented with socio-economic considerations and discussions with all stakeholders. Similar analyses in other parts of the NCP are possible but require more accurate modelling of landscape hydrology and (towards the coast) risk of salt water intrusion.

AB  - Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a well-established practice for managing groundwater reserves in a sustainable way. In this paper, we look at the influence of temperature variations of the infiltration water in the recharged aquifer. The paper focuses on MAR systems consisting of an infiltration pond surrounded by extraction wells. A number of different 20 configurations and an operational system in the Belgian dune area are investigated using field observations and numerical modelling with SEAWAT. Seasonally varying temperature in the infiltration water results in a zonation of subsequent lower and higher temperatures in the aquifer. The impact of infiltration water temperature in the aquifer is significant but restricted to the area between the pond and extraction wells, quickly decreasing farther from the infiltration area. Colder water during winter results in a decrease of infiltration capacity which can be as high as 1.5-2 times with respect to summer infiltration. Infiltration water temperature variations equally influence residence times of the infiltrated water. In general, residence times become smaller for water infiltrated during summer and larger for water infiltrated during winter. Infiltration and extraction rate, their ratios and seasonal variability, and location of extraction wells are all contributing factors to the impact of varying temperature of the infiltration water. Finally, it is shown that temperature provides only a rough proxy for residence times of solutes because of the important conduction of heat. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stream-aquifer interaction has been the subject of much research for cases of good hydraulic connection (continuous saturated zone) between a river and an aquifer. Under these conditions, floods do not represent a very large net input to the aquifer because most of the water that enters the aquifer during the flood returns to the river when its stage recedes. The situation is different in disconnected stream-aquifer systems, where the streambed lies above the water level in the aquifer, thus preventing return flow from the aquifer. Under these conditions, floods may represent large, but hard to quantify, water inputs. Here, we present a methodology to estimate recharge from floods for disconnected stream-aquifer systems. Recharge is estimated as the product of a flood time function (dependent on the streamflow) and an unknown factor, which is obtained from calibrating a ground water flow model to aquifer heads. The approach can also benefit from concentration data, which can be very informative when river water concentrations vary over time. This methodology is applied to a field situation where recharge from river flooding is found to amount to nearly 15 million m(3)/year on the average, which represents 40% of the total aquifer inputs. Recharge from flooding helps explain major head recoveries, suggesting that basin water management programs should allow some floods to occur.

AB  - The absence of either state regulations or markets to coordinate the operation of individual wells has focussed attention on community level institutions as the primary loci for sustainable groundwater management in Rajasthan and Gujarat, India. The reported research relied on theoretical propositions that livelihood strategies, groundwater management and the propensity to cooperate are associated with the attitudinal orientations of well owners in the Meghraj and Dharta watersheds, located in Gujarat and Rajasthan respectively. The research tested the hypothesis that attitudes to groundwater management and farming practices, household income and trust levels of assisting agencies were not consistent across the watersheds, implying that a targeted approach, in contrast to default uniform programs, would assist communities craft rules to manage groundwater across multiple hydro-geological settings. Hierarchical cluster analysis of attitudes held by survey respondents revealed four statistically significant discrete clusters, supporting acceptance of the hypothesis. Further analyses revealed significant differences in farming practices, household wealth and willingness to adapt across the four groundwater management clusters. In conclusion, the need to account for attitudinal diversity is highlighted and a framework to guide the specific design of processes to assist communities craft coordinating instruments to sustainably manage local aquifers described.

AB  - This article discusses how new contributions from hydrogeological science in the 20th and 21st centuries have allowed for a better understanding of the processes that affect the maintenance of river flows. Moreover, the way in which this knowledge has been conveyed beyond academia and has been gradually incorporated into public policy for natural resource management is also discussed. This article explains the development of several approaches used to understand the relationships among the management of aquifers, vegetation and river flows, including water balance, aquifer recharge, the piston effect, seasonal effects, and safe and sustainable yields. Additionally, the current challenges regarding the modeling of hydrological processes that integrate groundwater and surface waters are discussed. Examples of studies applied in Brazil that demonstrate these processes and stimulate thought regarding water management strategies are presented. In light of the case studies, it is possible to propose different strategies, each adapted for specific hydrogeological context to maximize aquifer recharge or base flow maintenance. Based on these strategies, the role of infiltration ponds and other artificial recharge techniques is re-evaluated in the context of the mitigation of environmental impacts on the maintenance of river flows. Proposals for the improvement of public policies regarding the payment of related environmental services to stimulate investment in aquifer recharge and the maintenance of base flow, for which the goal is to attain win-win-win situations for the environment, farmers and water users, while preventing land speculation, are discussed. Lastly, a conceptual model for the dissemination of hydrogeological knowledge in public policies is provided, and its challenges and possibilities are discussed.

AB  - A sustainable strategy for conjunctive water management must include information on the temporal and spatial availability of this natural resource. Because of water shortages in the dry seasons, farmers on the Upper Plain of the Chao Phraya River basin, Thailand, are increasingly using groundwater to meet their irrigation needs. To evaluate the possibilities of conjunctive water management in the area, the spatial-temporal changes in the water table of the Younger Terrace Aquifer were investigated. First, a regional geomorphological map based on field surveys, remote sensing and previous environmental studies was developed. Then, the well data were analyzed in relation to rainfall, streamflow, yield and pumpage, and the data were interpolated using geostatistical techniques. The results were analyzed via integrated zoning based on color theory as applied to multivariate visualization. The analysis results indicate areas that would be more suitable for groundwater extraction in a conjunctive management framework with regard to the natural hydrogeological processes and the effects of human interaction. The kriging results were compared with the geomorphological map, and the geomorphological areas exhibit distinct hydrogeological patterns. The western fans exhibit the best potential for the expansion of conjunctive use, whereas the borders of the northern fans exhibit the lowest potential.

AB  - This study takes into account groundwater in local development strategies of Izmir, in which rapid and uneven development has occurred in recent decades. Therefore, resilience thinking is needed in the future development of the city-region. To this end, the paper aims to make an analysis of recently completed asset-based local development strategies for Izmir city towards water resiliency. The methodology has two main steps. Firstly, by using spatial interaction analysis of peninsula and river basins, potential vulnerabilities and risks are indicated. Secondly, a stratified model of strategy evaluation is conducted by scrutinizing the existing layered approaches. Then, these models were applied to all strategic decisions including water resources and indicated a high level of consistency to achieve sustainable and resilient use of blue-green infrastructure in the future of Izmir's metropolitan area. Local assets, including water resources, are the backbone of future development of the Izmir city-region. Therefore, usage of local assets in a multi-level perspective of strategy development needs to be understood. The stratified model denotes that special emphasis should be given to different river basins in different levels. This study illustrates that synergy management is needed between different layers of local development strategies, in which the role of urban and rural households is of the utmost importance.

AB  - Watershed management in rainfed agricultural areas of arid and semi-arid regions aims at alleviating agricultural drought by employing water conservation measures. Water conservation measures serve as mechanisms for recharging groundwater, and also for surface storage. While the benefits derived from these structures is widely accepted, there is increasing concern regarding their sustainability and efficiency. The application of water conservation measures in upstream reaches contributes to reduced inflows to downstream reaches and structures. Currently watershed management is planned by considering elementary information about the hydrological regime and its associated impacts on the upstream reaches of the watershed. This approach may lead to inefficient water conservation structures, and there is also a significant probability that the structure may be under designed (or over designed). Therefore, careful planning that considers the hydrological changes that the conservation structure may bring in the watershed and the associated benefits/compromise for both upstream and downstream is essential for developing a successful watershed management plan. A simulation-optimization framework for optimal sizing of the water conservation structure considering the dual objectives of improving the benefits in the upstream reaches while maintaining flows in the downstream reaches is proposed in this study. The proposed method is demonstrated for optimal sizing of water conservation structures (check dams in this study) for an experimental watershed in Kondepi Mandal, Andhra Pradesh, India. The results indicate that the check dams of sizes obtained from both traditional method and simulation-optimization method increase moisture availability in the watershed. However, for check dam sizes obtained from the simulation-optimization framework, there is an increase in the flow to downstream reaches compared to the check dam sizes obtained from the traditional methods. The increase in downstream flows obtained by optimizing the check dam heights is at the expense of increased moisture stress days in the non-growing period, thus, not affecting the crop growth or productivity. The results from this study indicate that the proposed simulation-optimization framework can be of assistance in sizing of check dams for sustainable and effective watershed management.

As climate is one of the main factors which affects groundwater resources, the main objective of the present study is to assess the impact of rainfall changes on the groundwater system by projecting the future changes in the 21st century (2021-2050 and 2071-2100). For this reason, the RegCM3 climate model precipitation data, which showed a reduction in rainfall, was entered in the steady-state groundwater flow model MODFLOW for the case study of a coastal aquifer in the eastern part of the Thermaikos Gulf (North Greece). The uprising urbanization in combination with the intensive cultivation have led to the overexploitation of the coastal aquifer and seawater intrusion. The groundwater flow simulation by using the MODFLOW code indicates a negative water budget and estimates the quantities of the seawater intrusion. According to the RegCM3 climate model, the precipitation reduction is estimated to be 4% during the period of 2021-2050, while the precipitation decrease is expected to be 22% during the period of 2071-2100. Furthermore, the natural recharge of the coastal aquifer is expected to be influenced by the precipitation reduction. Finally, the seawater intrusion amounts are expected to increase during these future periods and more specifically during the second period of 2071-2100.

AB  - Groundwater management authorities usually use groundwater budget calculations to evaluate the sustainability of withdrawals for different purposes. The groundwater budget calculation does not always provide reliable information, and it must often be supported by further aquifer monitoring in the case of hydraulic connections between neighboring aquifers. The Riardo Plain aquifer is a strategic drinking resource for more than 100,000 people, water storage for 60 km(2) of irrigated land, and the source of a mineral water bottling plant. Over a long period, the comparison between the direct recharge and the estimated natural outflow and withdrawals highlights a severe water deficit of approximately 40% of the total groundwater outflow. A groundwater budget deficit should be a clue to the aquifer depletion, but the results of long-term water level monitoring allowed the observation of the good condition of this aquifer. In fact, in the Riardo Plain, the calculated deficit is not comparable to the aquifer monitoring data acquired in the same period (1992-2014). The small oscillations of the groundwater level and the almost stable streambed spring discharge allows the presumption of an additional aquifer recharge source. The confined carbonate aquifer locally mixes with the above volcanic aquifer, providing an externally stable recharge that reduces the effects of the local rainfall variability. The combined approach of the groundwater budget results and long-term aquifer monitoring (spring discharge and/or hydraulic head oscillation) provides information about significant external groundwater exchanges, even if unidentified by field measurements, and supports the stakeholders in groundwater resource management.

AB  - This paper describes a simulation-optimization model aimed at helping water utilities determine the best way to operate large-scale multisource water-supply systems. The operation of water systems is optimized taking into account the principal planning objectives defined for interventions that include reducing operating costs, satisfying demand, delivering water of appropriate quality, and not prompting the use of emergency sources. The model allows that these planning objectives may not be completely fulfilled in critical circumstances (e.g., droughts) when goals have to be prioritized by the water utilities. The model is a highly nonlinear programming problem and is solved with the general algebraic modeling system (GAMS), using the MINOS algorithm (GAMS/MINOS). The application of the model to the multimunicipal urban water-supply system of the Algarve shows its capabilities for optimizing the operation considering economic and noneconomic goals included in the objective function and to cope with future shortages in critical circumstances by improving the conjunctive use of the different water sources with interannual planning time horizons.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the 5th FP project AISUWRS (Assessing and Improving the Sustainability of Urban Water Resources and Systems) which aimed to assess the impact of the urban water infrastructure to underlying or nearby aquifers with the urban water balance modelling approach - a chain of different models that handle with contaminant fluxes and the movement of contaminants from the urban infrastructure into the underlying aquifer. An existing urban water management model UVQ was linked to a model for sewer infiltration and exfiltration (NEIMO), as well as unsaturated zone models (SLeakl/POSI, UL_FLOW) with existing numerical groundwater models. The linked process models offer the prospect of better quantification of urban water balance and contaminant loads, including improved estimates of total recharge and its components in urban areas. Once the model framework has been set up for a selected city, it can easily be updated in the future and it can be used for other purposes like planning of local remediation measures in the vicinity of individual contaminant spillages. This paper describes the application and results of the urban water model chain for the city of Ljubljana, which is the capital of Slovenia. The results from this study suggest that residential land-uses in urban areas with thick unsaturated zone may have significantly smaller impact on the groundwater than agriculture or industry. This can be seen as a speculative understanding of the groundwater pollutions problems. In this respect, use of sustainable urban development systems like on-site infiltration of roof runoff and improved sewer control and standards could result in better groundwater quality.

AB  - A reliable quantification of groundwater recharge (GR) is essential for sustainable water resources management. This can be particularly relevant in regions where an increase in the duration and frequency of drought events is predicted due to future climate change. Although there exists a large variety of GR estimation methods, their results can differ considerably for an individual site due to the spatio-temporal scales and complexities they represent. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the potential range of GR estimates to allow for consistency and objective inter-comparison of modeling results among different sites. The current study systematically assesses the performance of six frequently used GR estimation methods, which differ in terms of their underlying conceptual framework and complexity. These methods utilize experimental data (lysimeter, river streamflow, groundwater-table variations) as well as soil-water-balance and physically-based modeling concepts. 13 years of hydro-climatic data were analyzed from the Swiss Rietholzbach research catchment for different temporal resolutions and extreme climatic conditions (i.e., dry periods). The major limitations and strengths of the six GR estimation methods were identified and summarized in a comprehensive overview, which will facilitate the selection of an adequate technique for the estimation of GR in future studies.

AB  - Coastal and inland dunes provide various ecosystem services that are related to groundwater, such as drinking water production and biodiversity. To manage groundwater in a sustainable manner, knowledge of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for the various land covers in dunes is essential. Aiming at improving the parameterization of dune vegetation in hydrometeorological models, this study explores the magnitude of energy and water fluxes in an inland dune ecosystem in the Netherlands. Hydrometeorological measurements were used to parameterize the Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration model for four different surfaces: bare sand, moss, grass and heather. We found that the net longwave radiation (R-nl) was the largest energy flux for most surfaces during daytime. However, modeling this flux by a calibrated FAO-56 R-nl model for each surface and for hourly time steps was unsuccessful. Our R-nl model, with a novel submodel using solar elevation angle and air temperature to describe the diurnal pattern in radiative surface temperature, improved R-nl simulations considerably. Model simulations of evaporation from moss surfaces showed that the modulating effect of mosses on the water balance is species-dependent. We demonstrate that dense moss carpets (Campylopus introflexus) evaporate more (5%, +14 mm) than bare sand (total of 258 mm in 2013), while more open-structured mosses (Hypnum cupressiforme) evaporate less (30 %, 76 mm) than bare sand. Additionally, we found that a drought event in the summer of 2013 showed a pronounced delayed signal on lysimeter measurements of ETa for the grass and heather surfaces, respectively. Due to the desiccation of leaves after the drought event, and their feedback on the surface resistance, the potential evapotranspiration in the year 2013 dropped by 9% (37 mm) and 10% (61 mm) for the grass and heather surfaces, respectively, which subsequently led to lowered ETa of 8% (29 mm) and 7% (29 mm). These feedbacks are of importance for water resources, especially during a changing climate with an increasing number of drought days. Therefore, such feedbacks need to be integrated into a coupled plant physiological and hydrometeorological model to accurately simulate ETa. In addition, our study showed that groundwater recharge in dunes can be increased considerably by promoting moss vegetation, especially of open-structured moss species.

AB  - The northern coastal part of Korinthia prefecture can be characterized as an agrotourism center that has grown and urbanized rapidly. The area is formed of recent unconsolidated material consisting of sands, pebbles, breccias and fine clay to silty sand deposits. These deposits host the main aquifer system of the area, which depends on groundwater as a water resource. Groundwater is the main source for irrigation in the area. A total water volume of 29.2 x 10(6)-34.3 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) was estimated to recharge the aquifer system from direct infiltration of rainfall, streambed infiltration, irrigation return, artificial recharge via flood irrigation and lateral subsurface inflows. The present annual abstraction ranges between 39.2 x 10(6) and 44.6 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1). Groundwater abstraction in dry years exceeds renewable freshwater resources by more than 38%. Approximately 79% of the total abstraction is consumed for agriculture supply. Water balance in the coastal aquifer system is in disequilibrium; a deficit, which ranges from 4.9 x 10(6) to 15.4 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) exists. The safe yield of the coastal aquifer system has been estimated at 37.1 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) for normal hydrological year and 32 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) for severely dry hydrological year. The total abstraction is greater than the recharge and the safe yield of the aquifer. The aquifer system has shown signs of depletion, seawater intrusion and quality contamination. The integrated water resources management, securing water in the future, should include measures that augment groundwater budget in the coastal aquifer of the study area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In ancient Hellas, water management began in the early Minoan Era (ca. 3200-1100 BC) and was related to the geomorphology, the geology, the topography, and the local climatic, hydrological, and socio-political conditions. Historical and archaeological evidences show that ancient Greeks had developed even qanat-related technologies since the Classical times. During democratic periods, the focus of water management was on sustainable small scale, safe, and cost effective management practices, and institutional arrangements, whereas in oligarchic periods, emphasis was on the construction of large-scale hydraulic projects, including aqueducts and/or qanats, mostly related to the public sectors. Aqueducts-like qanats are gently sloping, artificially constructed underground galleries, which bring groundwater from the mountainous area to the lowlands, where water is used, sometimes several kilometers away. It is worth noticing that no large-scale lifting techniques were available, and water was transferred from the source (usually a spring) by aqueducts (qanats) from a higher elevation to a lower level by gravity. Historically, the aqueduct-like qanat technology was developed by Persians in the middle of 1st Millennium BC, and spread towards the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt. The expansion of Islam led to diffusion of qanats in Mediterranean countries (e. g., Spain, Italy, and Cyprus). Much of the population of Iran and other arid countries in North Africa and in Asia depend on water supply by aqueducts-like qanats, even today. This technology is characterized by its durability and sustainability, although an aqueduct-like qanat is expensive, both in construction and maintenance. It is pointed out that, the technique of tunneling was used during the Classical period in ancient Hellas. Since the well known tunnel at the island of Samos, Hellas, was designed and constructed by Eupalinos (ca. 530 BC), several underground tunnels (with and without well-like vertical shafts) in order to convey water from one location to another one located in a lower level were implemented in this country. Several aqueducts (qanat) paradigms (e. g., in Athens, on islands of Crete and Rhodes, and in the area of Serres in north country), which are in use even today, are presented and discussed. Overall, it seems that water-related problems of modern societies are not very different from those during antiquity.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a relationship between rainfall and surface water (runoff) in South Crete, Greece. This application was carried out on five sub-basins in the Messara valley, with a total surface of 1125 km2. Three factors were taken into account: the climate regime including precipitation and air temperature, the geological nature of the ground and the surface area of the basin. The development of the rainfall-discharge model consisted of three steps. Firstly, the actual evapotranspiration (Er) was computed. Secondly, the storage capacity of each hydrogeological unit in every catchment area was geologically estimated and, lastly, the rainfall-runoff model was developed using the water balance equation and the above mentioned relationship of Er. The amount of variance in runoff between the sub-basins explained by those three factors was 92%. Decreases in mean annual precipitation by 17 and 15% for east and west Messara, respectively, predicted by the regional climate model REMO resulted in even more drastic mean runoff reductions by 29 and 32% at the respective sides of the valley. Furthermore, the coefficient of variation of runoff increased by more than 15% in the east side of the valley but dropped by only 1.5% in the west. The proposed rainfall-discharge relationship is a useful tool for hydrological management and evaluation of water resources under the present-day and future climate conditions in Messara valley in Crete.

AB  - The coastal aquifer system of the Eastern Thermaikos gulf is under many pressures, e.g. urbanisation, intensive agricultural, tourism, climatic changes, etc. Water needs are mainly covered by groundwater abstracted from the aquifer systems via numerous wells and boreholes. The results or chemical analyses of groundwater samples, collected during the period April-May 2005, were used. High chloride concentrations and electrical conductivity values are recorded in the northern part of the study area. High nitrate concentrations are locally recorded and should be attributed to agricultural activities. The groundwaters are of various hydrochemical types, as illustrated by the Piper diagram. In order to define the areal extent of sea water intrusion hydrochemical section, ions ratio and several parameters were used. The coastal aquifer system of the study area shows signs of quality deterioration and a rational management plan should be applied in order to improve the groundwater quality.

AB  - Many human communities living in coastal areas in Africa and Asia rely on thin freshwater lenses for their domestic supply. Population growth together with change in rainfall patterns and sea level will probably impact these vulnerable groundwater resources. Spatial knowledge of the aquifer properties and creation of a groundwater model are required for achieving a sustainable management of the resource. This paper presents a ready-to-use methodology for estimating the key aquifer properties and the freshwater resource based on the joint use of two non-invasive geophysical tools together with common hydrological measurements. We applied the proposed methodology in an unconfined aquifer of a coastal sandy barrier in South-Western India. We jointly used magnetic resonance and transient electromagnetic soundings and we monitored rainfall, groundwater level and groundwater electrical conductivity. The combined interpretation of geophysical and hydrological results allowed estimating the aquifer properties and mapping the freshwater lens. Depending on the location and season, we estimate the freshwater reserve to range between 400 and 700 L m(-2) of surface area (+/- 50%). We also estimate the recharge using time lapse geophysical measurements with hydrological monitoring. After a rainy event close to 100% of the rain is reaching the water table, but the net recharge at the end of the monsoon is less than 10% of the rain. Thus, we conclude that a change in rainfall patterns will probably not impact the groundwater resource since most of the rain water recharging the aquifer is flowing towards the sea and the river. However, a change in sea level will impact both the groundwater reserve and net recharge.

However, these alluvial aquifers are poorly represented in the literature. Extensive field investigations allowed estimation of stored water volume and characterisation of an alluvial aquifer. New hydrological insights for the region: Computed alluvial aquifer properties included hydraulic conductivity of 20-300 m/d, porosity of 38-40%, and aquifer thickness of 0-6 m. Dykes and other subcrops commonly compartmentalise the aquifer though do not form barriers to flow. A hydraulic disconnect between deep groundwater (occurring in fractured metamorphic rocks) and the alluvial aquifer was revealed by groundwater levels and contrasting hydrochemistry and stable isotope signatures. The dominant recharge process of the alluvial aquifer is surface runoff occurring from torrential tributaries in the catchment's upper reaches. A fraction of available storage is currently abstracted and there exists potential for greater exploitation for smallholder irrigation and other uses.

AB  - Climate and land cover are two major factors affecting the water fluxes and balance across spatiotemporal scales. These two factors and their impacts on hydrology are often interlinked. The quantification and differentiation of such impacts is important for developing sustainable land and water management strategies. Here, we calibrated the well-known Hydrus-1D model in a data-rich boreal headwater catchment in Scotland to assess the role of two dominant vegetation types (shrubs vs. trees) in regulating the soil water partitioning and balance. We also applied previously established climate projections for the area and replaced shrubs with trees to imitate current land use change proposals in the region, so as to quantify the potential impacts of climate and land cover changes on soil hydrology. Under tree cover, evapotranspiration and deep percolation to recharge groundwater was about 44% and 57% of annual precipitation, whilst they were about 10% lower and 9% higher respectively under shrub cover in this humid, low energy environment. Meanwhile, tree canopies intercepted 39% of annual precipitation in comparison to 23% by shrubs. Soils with shrub cover stored more water than tree cover. Land cover change was shown to have stronger impacts than projected climate change. With a complete replacement of shrubs with trees under future climate projections at this site, evapotranspiration is expected to increase by similar to 39% while percolation to decrease by 21% relative to the current level, more pronounced than the modest changes in the two components (<8%) with climate change only. The impacts would be particularly marked in warm seasons, which may result in water stress experienced by the vegetation. The findings provide an important evidence base for adaptive management strategies of future changes in low-energy humid environments, where vegetation growth is usually restricted by radiative energy and not water availability while few studies that quantify soil water partitioning exist.

AB  - Carbonate rock thermal reservoirs are important geothermal resources but lack systematical study on a regional scale. This paper integrated hydrochemical and isotopic data to outline thermal water resources in carbonate rock aquifers as part of deep regional groundwater flow system. Hydrochemical characteristics of thermal groundwater in northern Jinan geothermal field, where Ordovician carbonate rocks are the main thermal reservoir, were examined and characterized by SO4-Ca, SO4-Ca center dot Na, SO4 center dot Cl-Ca center dot Na and Cl center dot SO4-Na center dot Ca types. Hydrochemical evolution was revealed by analyzing correlation between different chemical constituents and their relative changes in various waters. Isotopic data allowed the origin of thermal water to be determined and presented different recharge elevations. Thermal groundwater was originated from precipitation in the northern piedmont of Tai Mountain with elevation of 708-1493 m.a.s.l. Reservoir temperature was estimated by chemical geothermometry and validated by fluid-mineral equilibria calculations. The feasibility of different geothermometers was verified, indicating that quartz geothermometers were more suitable for the geothermal system and yielded reservoir temperatures of 60-80 degrees C. Finally, a conceptual hydrogeological model of the geothermal field was proposed: thermal groundwater was derived from regional flow system with high recharge areas, deep circulation depth and slow flow velocities, confirmed by its depleted stable isotopic contents, high chloride and TDS concentrations and long residence time. The improved understanding of this geothermal system is fundamental for the better management of this karst geothermal resource. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Discharge-area groundwater in Jinan, a typical karst region in northern China, was investigated by studying both the hydrological and chemical processes evolving from the recharge in mountainous terrains to the karst-spring outflows in the metropolitan area. Large-scale exploitation of karst groundwater has led to a disturbing trend in the ever-decreasing spring outflow rates and groundwater level. There is insufficient information about the Jinan karst aquifers, which provide the main water sources to meet human demand and to sustain spring outflow. The coupling of hydrological and chemical processes quantifies the flow system through aqueous chemistry characterization of the water sources. This approach is used to study the groundwater flow discharges in different locations and geological settings. The potentiometric data indicated limited vertical connectivity between distinct hydrogeological units and alteration of the recharge regime by the faults and by artificial exploitation. Shallow groundwater primarily belongs to the local flow system, with high nitrate concentration and enriched stable isotopic contents. Thermal groundwater has high concentrations of chloride and total dissolved solids, derived from a regional flow system with the highest recharge altitudes and long residence time. Non-thermal karst water may be attributed to the intermediate flow system, with uniform HCO3-Ca(Mg) facies and low nitrate concentration. This work highlighted discharge as a fingerprint of groundwater flow conditions and provides a better insight into the hydrogeological system.

AB  - Groundwater plays a dominant role in the eco-environmental protection of arid/semi-arid areas. Understanding sources and mechanisms of groundwater recharge in the Ejina Basin, an arid inland river basin in northwest China, is important for water resource planning in this ecologically sensitive area. In this study, 90 water samples were collected from rainfall, rivers and lakes, and springs and pumping wells in 2009. Analysis of the aquifer system and hydrological conditions, together with hydrogeochemical and isotope techniques were used to investigate groundwater sources and their associated recharge processes. Our results show that shallow phreatic and deep confined groundwater differ greatly in their compositions, with a distinct spatial heterogeneity of phreatic groundwater TDS (from 365 mg/L to 5833 mg/L), which increase along the shallow groundwater flow paths. Groundwater chemical evolution is mainly controlled by rock dominance and the evaporation-crystallization process, and the dominant anion species change systematically from HCO3 to SO4 to Cl, and the dissolved ions within the groundwater system from Na- and K-rich minerals and sulfate phases also contribute significantly to the groundwater composition. The stable isotope levels (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of the surface water and the shallow phreatic groundwater confirm that the Heihe River and Badain Jaran Desert groundwater are the main sources recharging the phreatic aquifer in the Ejina Basin. Thus, river infiltration and desert front recharge should be considered as the two main recharge mechanisms of the Ejina aquifer. However, recharge from the Badain Jaran Desert aquifer to the Ejina Basin has occurred at a lower rate due to acidification since the middle Holocene. For this reason, the sustainable improvement of the ecological environment should be based on the shallow groundwater recharge of the phreatic aquifer in the Ejina Delta, which mainly takes place via seepage through the riverbed and direct infiltration during periods of environmental flow control.

AB  - In this study, the marine ecological cycle is divided into subsystems of science and technology (T), the environment (E), resources (R), and the economy (E). A TERE model is constructed to measure the marine bearing capacity by taking the energy output of oceans as the impetus for the entire marine system. We construct a system dynamics model of the marine bearing capacity in Qingdao, China and establish the TERE model to simulate the status of 30 variables when the system reaches a steady state. Accordingly, five schemes-population control, pollution control, fishery control, economic growth, and no change-are proposed to predict the trends in economic growth, population growth, and environmental development in Qingdao City over a five-year period and to determine the optimal scheme. Generally, the pollution control scheme is optimal, regardless of economic development or reductions in energy consumption and emissions. Therefore, Qingdao City should enhance its environmental protection measures to ensure that the economy and environment develop in harmony. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water resource crises are an increasing threat to human survival and development. To reveal the nature of water resource issues under changing situations, the water resources system needs to be studied from a macro and systematic perspective. This report develops a water resources system into a water resources compound system that is constantly evolving under the combined action of the development, resistant, and coordination mechanisms. Additionally, the water quotient is defined as a quantitative representation of the sustainable development state of the water resources compound system. Four cities in China, Beijing, Fuzhou, Urumqi, and Lhasa, were selected as the study areas. The differences in the three types of mechanisms and the water quotient of the water resources compound system of each city in 2013 were compared. The results indicate that the different subsystems that comprise the compound system of a given area have different development mechanisms and resistant mechanisms. There are clear differences in the mechanisms and the water quotients for the water resources compound systems of different regions. Pertinent measures should be taken into account during integrated water resource management to improve the sustainable development status of regional water resources compound systems.

AB  - The study on the relationship between the soilmass deformation and water seepage under certain stress in North China was conducted through combined tests of the consolidation deformation and water seepage. The results showed that the actual deformation of the clay soil under stress is greater than the deformation induced by the seepage. On average, the deformation induced by seepage was about 60% of the actual clay deformation under stress. The actual deformation of sandy soil, however, is less than the deformation induced by seepage. On average, the seepage-induced deformation was approximately 125% of the actual sandy soil deformation. These results indicated that the sandy soil did not have complete plasticity. Clay had the highest amount of water seepage and deformation, while silty soil, calcareous highly cemented clayed soil and sandy soil had less water seepage and deformation. The underlying mechanisms were also discussed. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of land subsidence mechanism and rough estimation of groundwater exploitation.

AB  - In order to study treatment measures for the land subsidence caused by deep groundwater overexploitation, we conducted soil compression and rebound tests to analyze the unloading and rebound regularity of deep soil on the fringes of three typical land subsidence regions in North China. Using fuzzy mathematics, we specifically explored the main factors influencing the soil mass unloading resiliency. The results indicated that the ratio between the unloading resilience volume and the loading deformation volume of soil mass in the study areas (referred to as the resilience capacity of soil mass) is between 1.6 and 37.6 %, with an average of 14.7 %. In other words, only about 14.7 % of the land subsidence deformation in the study areas can be restored. The soil masses with different properties in North China all possess elastoplasticity and the resilience capacities of soil can vary from area to area. The sandy soil is not completely elastic but has a certain degree of plasticity; the resilience capacity of soil mass is not a constant, but rather, a variable that changes with the rebound stress value. When the rebounding stress value is determined, the resilience capacity under a smaller unloading stress is larger than that under a larger unloading stress, which demonstrates that earlier land subsidence treatment can result in better effects. Meanwhile, the resilience capacity of soil mass is also enhanced with the increase of rebounding stress, indicating that the closer to the original groundwater level the restored groundwater is, the better the resilience capacity will be. After repeated loading and unloading tests have been conducted under the same stress, the resilience capacity of soil mass will, in most cases, increase to a certain extent. These results can be quite conducive to the treatment of deep groundwater exploitation-induced disasters such as land subsidence.

AB  - The need to adapt irrigation patterns to water shortages in the world's dry regions continues to inspire economically attractive measures to sustain food security and improve farm incomes. Ongoing evidence of climate variability and growing populations amplify the importance of this search. Motivated by recent severe drought in the southwestern United States, this study analyzes vulnerability, impacts, and adaptability by irrigation technology in a sub-basin of North America's Rio Grande. The study accounts for economic incentives affecting choices on irrigation technology, crop mix, and water source in the face of water conservation subsidies under various levels of surface water shortage. Findings show that when surface water supplies are reduced, farmers shift to aquifer pumping even when pumping raises the cost of production or reduces yield. An important on-farm drought adaptation mechanism comes by converting from surface irrigation to water conserving irrigation technologies when faced with lower financial costs for conversion. Public subsidies to convert from flood to drip irrigation offset many of the negative impacts of drought on farm income. These subsidies also raise the value of food production, reduce the amount of water applied to crops, but can increase crop water depletions. Our approach for analyzing drought adaptation impacts and adjustment mechanisms can be applied where water shortages loom, food security is important, and water conservation policies are under debate. Results provide insights for the design of adaptation mechanisms for the world's dry regions for which policymakers need to reduce economic damages from future climate variability and change.

AB  - Incentive pricing programs have potential to promote economically efficient water use patterns and provide a revenue Source to compensate for environmental damages. However, incentive pricing may impose disproportionate costs and aggravate poverty where high prices are. levied for basic human needs. This paper presents an analysis of it two-tiered water pricing system that sets a low price for subsistence needs, while charging it price equal to marginal Cost, including environmental cost, for discretionary uses. This pricing arrangement can promote efficient and sustainable water use patterns, goals set by the European Water Framework Directive, while meeting subsistence needs of poor households. Using data from the Rio Grande Basin of North America, a dynamic nonlinear program, maximizes the basin's total net economic and environmental benefits subject to several hydrological and institutional constraints. Supply costs, environmental costs, and resource costs are integrated in a model of a river basin's hydrology, economics, and institutions. Three programs are compared: (1) Law of the River, in which water allocations and prices are determined by rules governing water transfers; (2) marginal cost pricing, in which households pay the full marginal Cost of supplying treated water; (3) two-tiered pricing, in which households' Subsistence water needs are priced cheaply, while discretionary uses are priced at efficient levels. Compared to the Law of the River and marginal cost pricing, two-tiered pricing performs well for efficiency and adequately for sustainability and equity. Findings provide it general framework for formulating water pricing programs that promote economically and environmentally efficient water use programs while also addressing other policy goals.

AB  - Failure to effectively coordinate opportunistic extractions by individual well owners with groundwater recharge has led to increasing Indian groundwater scarcity, affecting future opportunities for improved rural livelihoods and household wellbeing. Investigation of the relationship between groundwater institutions, management attitudes and subjective wellbeing of Indian rural households has substantial potential to reveal initiatives that jointly improve aquifer sustainability and household wellbeing, yet has received limited attention. Subjective wellbeing was calculated as an index of dissatisfaction (IDS), revealing ranked importance and the level of dissatisfaction of individual factors selected from economic, environmental and social/relational wellbeing dimensions. High economic and environmental IDS scores were calculated for respondents in the Meghraj and Dharta watersheds, India, respectively. We tested an exploratory hypothesis that observed IDS differences were correlated with differences in life circumstances, (household attributes, income and assets) and psychological disposition (life guiding values and willingness to adapt). The distribution of ranked IDS wellbeing scores was estimated across four statistically distinct clusters reflecting attitudes towards sustainable groundwater management and practice. Decision tree analysis identified significantly different correlates of overall wellbeing specific to cluster membership and the watershed, supporting the research hypothesis. High income IDS scores were weakly correlated with actual total household income (r < 0.25) consistent with international studies. The results suggest a singular reliance on initiatives to improve household income is unlikely to manifest as improved individual subjective wellbeing for the Dharta and Meghraj watersheds.

AB  - The Macquarie Marshes is an intermittently flooded wetland complex covering nearly 200,000 ha. It is one of the largest semi-permanent wetland systems in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, and portions of the Marshes are listed as internationally important under the Ramsar Convention. Previous studies indicate that the Marshes have undergone accelerated ecological degradation since the 1980s. The ecological degradation is documented in declining biodiversity, encroaching of terrestrial species, colonisation of exotic species, and deterioration of floodplain forests. There is strong evidence that reduction in river flows is the principal cause of the decrease in ecological values. Although the streams are relatively well gauged and modelled, the lack of hydrological records within the Marshes hampers any attempts to quantitatively investigate the relationship between hydrological variation and ecosystem integrity. To enable a better understanding of the long-term hydrological variations within the key wetland systems, and in particular, to investigate the impacts of the different water management policies (e.g. environmental water) on wetlands, a river system model including the main wetland systems was needed. The morphological complex nature of the Marshes means that the approximation of hydrological regimes within wetlands using stream hydrographs would have been difficult and inaccurate. In this study, we built a coupled 1D/2D MIKE FLOOD floodplain hydrodynamic model based on a I m OEM derived from a LiDAR survey. Hydrological characteristics of key constituent wetlands such as the correlation between water level and inundation area, relationships between stream and wetlands and among wetlands were estimated using time series extracted from hydrodynamic simulations. These relationships were then introduced into the existing river hydrological model (IQQM) to represent the wetlands. The model was used in this study to simulate the daily behaviours of inflow/outflow, volume, and inundated area for key wetlands within the Marshes under natural conditions and recent water management practices for the period of July 1 1991 to June 30 2009. The results revealed that the recent water management practices have induced large changes to wetland hydrology. The most noticeable changes include the dramatic reductions in high flows (i.e. flows with less than 25% exceedence, reduction ranges from 85% to 98% of the high flow peak depending on the location), areal inundation extent (ranging from 13% to 79% depending on climatic conditions), and flow rising/falling rates (over 90% for high flows). Our analysis also highlighted that the impacts of water management practices on some of the flow variables for wetland habitats contrasted with those for instream habitats. For example, we did not find any evident alterations in the low flows (i.e. 75% exceedence) attributable to water management. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The control of groundwater abstraction from coastal aquifers is typically aimed at minimizing the risk of seawater intrusion, excessive storage depletion and adverse impacts on groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Published approaches to the operational management of groundwater abstraction from regulated coastal aquifers comprise elements of "trigger-level management" and "flux-based management". Trigger-level management relies on measured groundwater levels, groundwater salinities and/or ecosystem health indicators, which are compared to objective values (trigger levels), thereby invoking management responses (e.g. pumping cut-backs). Flux-based management apportions groundwater abstraction rates based on estimates of aquifer recharge and discharge (including environmental water requirements). This paper offers a critical evaluation of coastal aquifer management paradigms using published coastal aquifer case studies combined with a simple evaluation of the Uley South coastal aquifer, South Australia. There is evidence that trigger-level management offers advantages over flux-based approaches through the evaluation of real-time resource conditions and trends, allowing for management responses aimed at protecting against water quality deterioration and excessive storage depletion. However, flux-based approaches are critical for planning purposes, and are required to predict aquifer responses to climatic and pumping stresses. A simplified modelling analysis of the Uley South basin responses to different management strategies demonstrates the advantages of considering a hybrid management approach that includes both trigger-level and flux-based controls. It is recommended that where possible, trigger-level and flux-based approaches be adopted conjunctively to minimize the risk of coastal groundwater degradation and to underpin strategies for future aquifer management and well-field operation.

AB  - On atoll islands, fresh groundwater occurs as a buoyant lens-shaped body surrounded by saltwater derived from the sea, forming the main freshwater source for many island communities. A review of the state of knowledge of atoll island groundwater is overdue given their susceptibility to adverse impacts, and the task to address water access and sanitation issues within the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals framework before the year 2030. In this article, we review available literature to summarise the key processes, investigation techniques and management approaches of atoll island groundwater systems. Over fifty years of investigation has led to important advancements in the understanding of atoll hydrogeology, but a paucity of hydrogeological data persists on all but a small number of atoll islands. We find that the combined effects of buoyancy forces, complex geology, tides, episodic ocean events, strong climatic variability and human impacts create highly dynamic fresh groundwater lenses. Methods used to quantify freshwater availability range from simple empirical relationships to three-dimensional density-dependent models. Generic atoll island numerical models have proven popular in trying to unravel the individual factors controlling fresh groundwater lens behaviour. Major challenges face the inhabitants and custodians of atoll island aquifers, with rising anthropogenic stresses compounded by the threats of climate variability and change, sea-level rise, and some atolls already extracting freshwater at or above sustainability limits. We find that the study of atoll groundwater systems remains a critical area for further research effort to address persistent knowledge gaps, which lead to high uncertainties in water security issues for both island residents and surrounding environs.

AB  - The state of groundwater systems worldwide is presently not well defined, and in particular there is little context for agencies responsible for managing water resources to evaluate occurrences of groundwater depletion against other cases globally. In this study, an initial inventory of groundwater depletion problems is compiled and ranked to identify the world's most critical cases, i.e. situations of groundwater mega-depletion. The ranking is based on an indexed approach that considers overdraft, drawdown and subsidence, plus the importance of the resources in terms of population-dependency and rates of extraction. The five most highly ranked depleted aquifers of the world include the shallow aquifers of the Hai River Plain (China), the Altiplano region (Spain), the Mexico Basin (Mexico), the Huang River basin (China) and the California Central Valley (USA). An abridged account of modelling to assess drawdown is described for the Hai River Plain, revealing that despite recharge in the order of 13,000 GL/yr, an overdraft of about 8,000 GL/yr is occurring to support the vast population of the region. This has led to up to 100 m of drawdown in places and reports of subsidence of several metres. The Hai River situation demonstrates that falling water levels may not act to alleviate pumping stresses; a symptom of unchecked extraction and an exemplary illustration of the tragedy of the commons. The causal factors leading to mega-depletion are varying across the globe and each mega-depletion case contains unique elements, although population appears to be an important factor.

AB  - Due to semi-arid to arid climatic conditions, Jordan has limited groundwater resources. As a result of agricultural activities and untreated wastewater, most of the groundwater in the karstic areas is microbiologically contaminated. Groundwater vulnerability, hazards, and risk intensity were mapped (scale 1:50,000) at a test site near the Jordan Rift Valley. The mapping included the use of optical remote sensing to complement conventional data in areas with poor data. LANDSAT ETM+ data, and colour and panchromatic aerial photographs at different scales were incorporated using visual image interpretation and digital image processing. The applicability of the different remote sensing data sources is discussed and recommendations for their usage are given. Information derived from digital images offers new opportunities for vulnerability and hazard assessment, particularly when related to land use, vegetation cover, urbanisation and infrastructure. The resulting maps indicate clearly the vulnerable areas and the "hot spots" of potential contamination in the test site and form an important basis for integrated groundwater management studies and the long-term planning of protective measures. The application and transferability of the European vulnerability approach (COST Action 620) to the test site in Jordan proved to be good, in general, although modifications were necessary to suit local conditions.

AB  - The poly(A) (pA) signal possesses a dual function in 3' end processing of pre-mRNA and in transcriptional termination of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) for most eukaryotic protein-coding genes. A key protein factor in yeast and Drosophila Pol II transcriptional termination is the 3'-end processing factor, Pcf11. In vitro studies suggest that Pcf11 is capable of promoting the dissociation of Pol II elongation complexes from DNA. Moreover, several mutant alleles of yeast Pcf11 effect termination in vivo. However, functions of human Pcf11 (hPcf11) in Pol II termination have not been explored. Here we show that depletion of hPcf11 from HeLa cells reduces termination efficiency. Furthermore, we provide evidence that hPcf11 is required for the efficient degradation of the 3' product of pA site cleavage. Finally, we show that these functions of hPcf11 require an intact pA signal.

AB  - Groundwater is the world's largest freshwater resource and due to overextraction, levels have declined in many regions causing extensive social and environmental impacts. Groundwater management seeks to balance and mitigate the detrimental impacts of development, with plans commonly used to outline management pathways. Thus, plan efficiency is crucial, but seldom are plans systematically and quantitatively assessed for effectiveness. This study frames groundwater management as a system control problem in order to develop a novel testability assessment rubric to determine if plans meet the requirements of a control loop, and subsequently, whether they can be quantitatively tested. Seven components of a management plan equivalent to basic components of a control loop were determined, and requirements of each component necessary to enable testability were defined. Each component was weighted based upon proposed relative importance, then segmented into rated categories depending on the degree the requirements were met. Component importance varied but, a defined objective or acceptable impact was necessary for plans to be testable. The rubric was developed within the context of the Australian groundwater management industry, and while use of the rubric is not limited to Australia, it was applied to 15 Australian groundwater management plans and approximately 47% were found to be testable. Considering the importance of effective groundwater management, and the central role of plans, our lack of ability to test many plans is concerning.

AB  - Freshwater resources might become the most limited resource in the future due to rising demands, climate change, and the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. While the urgency of this challenge is uncontested, water governance regimes still struggle to employ suitable responses. They lack of: taking a comprehensive perspective on water systems; focusing on social actors, their actions, needs, intentions, and norms as drivers of water systems; engaging in a discourse on tangible goals to provide direction for governance efforts; and promoting a comprehensive perspective on water sustainability that equally recognizes depletion, justice, and livelihood issues in the long-term. We present an approach that intends to overcome these limitations by putting the focus on what people do with water, and why, along with the impacts of these doings. First, we outline an integrated approach to water governance regimes, and then, we present a holistic set of principles by which to evaluate sustainable water governance. Solution-oriented research applying this approach integrates natural sciences and engineering perspectives on water systems with social science studies on water governance, while also specifying and applying normative principles for water sustainability. The approach we develop herein can be used to reform and innovate existing water governance regimes as well as stimulate transformative governance research.

AB  - The Elbow River in southern Alberta, Canada is the source of the Glenmore reservoir, which provides drinking water to the City of Calgary. Due to the rapid population growth in Calgary, the Elbow River watershed (ERW) that covers about 1238 km(2) has been under considerable pressure for land-use development over the last decade. This study was undertaken to assess the impact of potential land-use changes over the next 20 years on the hydrological processes in ERW by combining a land-use cellular automata (CA) model and the distributed physically-based MIKE-SHE/MIKE-11 hydrological model. The CA model was calibrated using four land-use maps covering the period 1985-2001 and validated against the maps of 2006 and 2010. Simulations of land-use changes were then performed from 2006 to 2031 at a five year interval; land-use based parameters were extracted from the simulated maps and transferred to MIKE-SHE/MIKE-11. MIKE-SHE was calibrated for the period 1985-1990 and validated for the period 2000-2005. The Nash and Sutcliffe coefficients of efficiency calculated between observed and simulated flow data for the calibration and validation periods are 0.56, 0.52, 0.79, and 0.75 based on different hydrometric stations respectively, indicating an acceptable level of performance of the model. Land-use changes analyzed for the period 2001-2031 reveal a 65% increase in built-up areas, 20% in rangeland/parkland, and 1% in agriculture along with a reduction of 28% in deciduous, and 6% in evergreen forest. As a result, the hydrological modeling indicates an increase of 7.3% in overland flow, and a decrease of 1%, 13.2%, and 2.3% in total evapotranspiration, baseflow, and infiltration respectively along with a decrease of the total flow by 4%. These results reveal a potential significant negative impact on the sustainability of ground/surface water supplies and groundwater storages in the future in the watershed in addition to an increased risk of flashy floods. The study also revealed that due to the complex hydrological regime existing in the study area, a comprehensive physically-based method is required to better represent the interaction between groundwater and surface water. The combined CA/MIKE-SHE models appear as a useful tool to assess the impact of land-use changes on the hydrologic cycle and to better understand the connection among the hydrologic components in the Elbow River watershed.

AB  - Adapting to climate change is just one among many challenges facing river managers. The response will involve balancing the long-term water demands of society with the changing needs of the environment in sustainable and cost effective ways. This paper describes a modeling framework for evaluating the sensitivity of low river flows to different configurations of abstraction licensing under both historical climate variability and expected climate change. A rainfall-runoff model is used to quantify trade-offs among environmental flow (e-flow) requirements, potential surface and groundwater abstraction volumes, and the frequency of harmful low-flow conditions. Using the River Itchen in southern England as a case study it is shown that the abstraction volume is more sensitive to uncertainty in the regional climate change projection than to the e-flow target. It is also found that "smarter" licensing arrangements (involving a mix of hands off flows and "rising block" abstraction rules) could achieve e-flow targets more frequently than conventional seasonal abstraction limits, with only modest reductions in average annual yield, even under a hotter, drier climate change scenario.

AB  - Due to overcapacity, the current airport of Yogyakarta is going to be replaced with a new one, which is located in Wates coastal area, Kulon Progo District, Yogyakarta Special Province, Indonesia. One of the consequences of the development of the new airport is groundwater abstraction due to the airport's needs and related supporting activities. An excessive withdrawal of groundwater in the new airport will potentially change the system and the pattern of groundwater flow. Therefore, groundwater modeling should be done to predict the impact of groundwater abstraction in this area. MODFLOW code is used to simulate the groundwater flow and the impact of groundwater pumping in the Wates coastal aquifer. The model is calibrated using water level data from 40 wells in the research area. The results show that the calculated values are fit to the measured data, which indicates that the model is reliable. The effects of groundwater pumping on water table and seawater intrusion are investigated using a calibrated model. The results show that the pumping scenario from the airport area causes the groundwater level to drop 0.75 m and seawater intrusion inland to increase around 100 m.

AB  - We validated an existing physically based 3D MIKE SHE groundwater resource model (DK-model) at 175 Danish gauging stations covering different catchment sizes in order to calculate monthly water runoff in the 50% ungauged part of Denmark. Model performance was in most cases good (61% of gauging stations had a Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient >0.60) but nevertheless showed a large seasonal and georegion specific bias. Therefore, bias correction factors had to be developed before applying the DK-model simulations of runoff in the ungauged areas. Simulated monthly runoff from ungauged areas and the measured monthly runoff from 178 gauging stations were distributed to 2663 smaller Hydrological Units (ca. 15 km(2)) and linked with a new empirical model for flow-weighted monthly total nitrogen (TN) concentrations (R(2) 0.43; P < 0.0001) developed based on 20 years of observations (1990-2009) in 83 small catchments for calculation of monthly gross diffuse TN-loads from HU's. Nitrogen retention was calculated in streams, lakes and wetlands utilising both lake specific models and rate coefficients to calculate N retention in surface water bodies. The whole model complex was linked in the DK-QN concept for simulation of monthly TN losses from point sources and diffuse sources, TN retention and resulting loadings to Danish coastal waters. The DK-QN model was validated in 118 gauged catchments and the model simulations had for >25% of the observations of monthly discharge weighted TN concentrations a NS larger than 0.26. Catchment specific monthly TN-loadings were modelled with a higher performance as 50% of the catchments had a NS greater than 0.75. The model concept allows calculation of N retention in streams, lakes and wetlands and the average annual model calculated N retention amounted to 21% of the modelled gross riverine TN loadings. The average annual gross TN loading to surface freshwater in Denmark derived from diffuse sources amounted to 97 000 tonnes N (91% of gross TN loadings) which is 54% of the total estimated N-leaching from the root zone on the Danish land area (212 000 tonnes N) during the period 1990-2009.

AB  - The volume and sustainability of streamflow from headwaters to downstream reaches commonly depend on contributions from ground water. Streams that begin in extensive aquifers generally have a stable point of origin and substantial discharge in their headwaters. In contrast, streams that begin as discharge from rocks or sediments having low permeability have a point of origin that moves up and down the channel seasonally, have small incipient discharge, and commonly go dry. Nearly all streams need to have some contribution from ground water in order to provide reliable habitat for aquatic organisms. Natural processes and human activities can have a substantial effect on the flow of streams between their headwaters and downstream reaches. Streams lose water to ground water when and where their head is higher than the contiguous water table. Although very common in and regions, loss of stream water to ground water also is relatively common in humid regions. Evaporation, as well as transpiration from riparian vegetation, causing ground-water levels to decline also can cause loss of stream water. Human withdrawal of ground water commonly causes streamflow to decline, and in some regions has caused streams to cease flowing.

AB  - New Zealand's gravel-bed rivers have deposited coarse, highly conductive gravel aquifers that are predominantly fed by river water. Managing their groundwater resources is challenging because the recharge mechanisms in these rivers are poorly understood and recharge rates are difficult to predict, particularly under a more variable future climate. To understand the river-groundwater exchange processes in gravel-bed rivers, we investigate the Wairau Plain Aquifer using a three-dimensional groundwater flow model which was calibrated using targeted field observations, "soft" information from experts of the local water authority, parameter regularization techniques, and the model-independent parameter estimation software PEST. The uncertainty of simulated river-aquifer exchange flows, groundwater heads, spring flows, and mean transit times were evaluated using Null-space Monte-Carlo methods. Our analysis suggests that the river is hydraulically perched (losing) above the regional water table in its upper reaches and is gaining downstream where marine sediments overlay unconfined gravels. River recharge rates are on average 7.3 m(3)/s, but are highly dynamic in time and variable in space. Although the river discharge regularly hits 1000 m(3)/s, the net exchange flow rarely exceeds 12 m(3)/s and seems to be limited by the physical constraints of unit-gradient flux under disconnected rivers. An important finding for the management of the aquifer is that changes in aquifer storage are mainly affected by the frequency and duration of low-flow periods in the river. We hypothesize that the new insights into the river-groundwater exchange mechanisms of the presented case study are transferable to other rivers with similar characteristics.

AB  - Jeju Island is a volcanic island composed predominantly of permeable basalts. The island is poor in surface water but abundant in groundwater. No actual perennial streams exist and the water resources on the island are dependent almost entirely on groundwater. The groundwater bodies on the island are classified into three general categories: high level, basal and parabasal groundwaters. The parabasal groundwater is further subdivided into lower and upper parabasal groundwaters due to the position of the Seogwipo Formation, which is made up of sedimentary rocks with a low permeability. The distribution of each groundwater type was evaluated through analyses of the spatial distribution of the Seogwipo Formation and the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater. Basal groundwater emerges extensively along the coast of the eastern sector, less commonly along the coast of the western sector. Parabasal groundwater occurs extensively over most of the island except for the southern sector, where it occurs only locally in the coastal area. This paper presents a summary of several studies on the occurrence and features of groundwater resources on Jeju Island, the largest island in Korea.

AB  - Freshwater bodies are increasingly affected by reductions in water quantity and quality and by invasions of exotic species. To protect water quantity and maintain the ecological integrity of many water bodies in central Florida, a program of adopting Minimum Flows and Levels (MFLs) has begun for both lentic and lotic waters. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were relationships between discharge and stage, water quality, and biological parameters for Volusia Blue Spring, a first magnitude spring (discharge > 380,000 m(3) day(-1) or 100 mgd) for which an MFL program was adopted in 2006. Over the course of fourteen years, we assessed fish density and diversity weekly, monthly, or seasonally with seine and snorkel counts. We evaluated annual changes in the assemblages for relationships with water quantity and quality. Low discharge and dissolved oxygen combined with high stage and conductivity produced a fish population with a lower density and diversity in 2014 than in previous years. Densities of fish taxonomic/functional groups also were low in 2014 and measures of water quantity were significant predictors of fish assemblage structure. As a result of the strong relationships between variation in discharge and an array of chemical and biological characteristics of the spring, we conclude that maintaining the historical discharge rate is important for preserving the ecological integrity of Volusia Blue Spring.

AB  - To ensure safe mining of the Taigemiao no. 3 mine field in Inner Mongolia, China, it is very important to make clear the roof aquifer water abundance distribution feature. On the basis of collecting the main controlling factors of aquifer water abundance from the geological and hydrogeological prospecting data of the study area, the no. 2 coal seam roof aquifer water abundance of Taigemiao no. 3 mine field was analyzed and evaluated using three methods. The first method is analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-type water-richness index method (AHP-type WIM) which is commonly used. But AHP is relatively subjective, so we trying to use a more objective method which is weighed gray relational degree method (WGRDM); this method mainly used pure data analyzing, it is better than AHP-type WIM but still not perfect, so the comprehensive weighted method (CWM) is put forward by adopting the advantage of the former two methods. In order to assess the accuracy rate of the three methods quantificationally, the evaluation results of the three methods are compared respectively with the measured unit water inflow which can directly reflect the aquifer water abundance, which shows that the WGRDM is more accurate than AHP-type WIM, and the CWM is more scientific and accurate in both weight calculation and water abundance grading. The superiority of CWM is more obvious when there are too many evaluation factors.

AB  - Mismanagement has caused the overexploitation of one third of the major aquifers in Mexico, mainly due to excessive water extraction for agricultural irrigation. Santo Domingo (Baja California Sur, in northern Mexico, where agriculture absorbs nearly 80% of water) is the only aquifer in the Mexico where, after a period of overexploitation, equality between extraction and recharge rates was achieved, although this has not meant the securement of long-term water availability. This paper offers an analysis of hydrological resilience of a water-limited arid ecosystem under future extraction scenarios and changing climate conditions. A regional groundwater flow model is proposed using MODFLOW software. Then, different indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human-water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts. The aim was to recognize water insecurity scenarios and define appropriate actions to a more sustainable use of this scarce resource in the region. Thus, although runoff derived from extreme floods may favor infiltration, the involvement of local stakeholders and decision makers to reverse the adverse impacts of current water management and climate change is imperative if water availability and better quality are to be secured.

AB  - In semi-arid regions with high seasonal variability of water availability, adaptive management strategies and technical measures are required to ensure the sustainable use of water resources. In this study, managed recharge of storm water into a karst aquifer and the water level fluctuations related to pumping in a nearby wellfield were simulated at Wadi Wala, Jordan. We used a numerical equivalent porous medium (EPM) approach with specific adaptations to account for the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the karst aquifer. The model domain was vertically projected along the wadi course, resulting in a 2 dimensional model, and subdivided into hydraulic zones representing the karst-specific flow pattern of fast flow and slow depletion. Results show satisfying agreement of measured and simulated groundwater tables from 2002 to 2012 and predict a lowering of the average groundwater table until 2022 of around 2.7 m in the immediate surroundings of the reservoir and an increased depletion towards the wellfield, mainly caused by sedimentation in the reservoir and an associated decrease in infiltration. Abstraction at the wellfield changed considerably over the regarded time period and strongly influences the groundwater fluctuations, which shows the need of improved pumping management and monitoring. The results can serve as a basis for decision makers regarding an optimization of water management at the reservoir and wellfield. Furthermore, the presented numerical approach can be transferred to karst regions with similar physio-geographical conditions to assess managed aquifer recharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms by which stream water infiltrates through streambeds to recharge groundwater systems is essential to sustainable management of scarce water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. An inverted water table (IWT) can develop under a stream in response to the desaturation between the stream and underlying aquifer as the system changes from a connected to disconnected status. However, previous studies have suggested that the IWT can only occur at the bottom of a low permeability streambed in which only the vertical flow between the stream and groundwater during disconnection was assumed. In the present study, numerical simulations revealed that the lateral flow induced by capillarity or heterogeneity also plays an essential role on interactions between streams and aquifers. Three pathways were identified for the transition from connection to disconnection in homogenous systems; notably, the lowest point of an IWT can develop not only at the bottom of the streambed but also within the streambed or the aquifer in response to the initial desaturation at, above, or below the interface between the streambed and aquifer (IBSA), respectively. A sensitivity analysis indicated that in wide streams, the lowest point of an IWT only occurs at the bottom of the streambed; however, for a stream half width of 1 m above a 6 m thick sandy loam streambed, the lowest point occurs in the streambed as stream depth is less than 0.5 m. This critical stream depth increases with streambed thickness and decreases with stream width. Thus, in narrow streams the lowest point can also develop in a thick streambed under a shallow stream. In narrow streams, the lowest point also forms in the aquifer if the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed to that of the aquifer is greater than the ratio of the streambed thickness to the sum of the stream depth and the streambed thickness; correspondingly, the streambed is thin but relatively permeable and the stream is deep. Furthermore, in heterogeneous streambed systems, two or three pathways can simultaneously occur and various parts of the IWT occur at distinct positions relative to the IBSA. This challenges the commonly held assumption that streambed under a disconnected stream is always fully saturated, and limits the methods which introduce a negative or atmospheric pressure value at the IBSA to calculate seepage rate or assess stream-aquifer connectivity.

AB  - The water movement in irrigation districts, especially for paddy rice cultivation, is characterized by complicated factors. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a popular tool for understanding the hydroagronomic processes. However, it fails to simulate the hydrological processes and crop yields in paddy rice areas. In this study, we develop the SWAT model by incorporating new processes for irrigation and drainage. The evapotranspiration process in paddy fields is simulated on the basis of water storage conditions, and a controlling irrigation scheme is introduced to manage the irrigation and drainage operations. The irrigation function of local water storages, such as ponds and reservoirs, is extended for these storages in order to provide water in a timely manner to paddy fields. Moreover, an agronomic model is incorporated to estimate crop yields when available data sets are not satisfactory. The model is tested in Zhanghe Irrigation District, China. The simulated runoff matches well to the measurements and the results indicate the developed model is preferable to the original edition of SWAT. The estimate of the paddy rice yield is acceptable and the dynamics of water balance components approximately characterize the state of water movements in paddy fields. Therefore, the developed framework for SWAT is practical and capable of representing the hydrological processes in this irrigation district. Further work is still needed to more broadly test the model in areas with paddy rice cultivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coupled water and energy balance models have become increasingly popular for estimating groundwater recharge, because of the integration of energy and water balances and sometimes carbon balance. The additional balances are thought to constrain the water balance and as a result should help reduce the uncertainty of groundwater recharge. However, these models usually have a large number of parameters. The uncertainty of these parameters may result in a large uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimates. This study aims to assess the potential uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a widely used water and energy model. It is largely based on annual pasture vegetation in the lower part of the Campaspe catchment in southeast Australia. A Monte Carlo analysis method was employed to examine potential uncertainties introduced by different types of errors. The results show that for a mean rainfall of 398 mm/y and using a particular set of pedotransfer functions for deriving soil hydraulic parameters, the estimated recharge ranged from 7 to 144 mm/y due to the uncertainty in vegetation parameters. This upper bound of the recharge range increased to 236 mm/y when using different sets of pedotransfer functions. Through several synthetic test cases, this study shows that soil moisture time series may not offer much help for reducing recharge uncertainty, whereas evapotranspiration time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50%. The reduction in recharge uncertainty steadily improves as the uncertainty in observations reduces. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To address land subsidence problems caused by the combined effects of groundwater exploitation and high-rise building loads in Cangzhou, Biot's consolidation theory was combined with the nonlinear rheological theory of soils, and the constitutive relation in Biot's consolidation theory was extended to viscoelastic plasticity. The dynamic relationships among porosity, hydraulic conductivity, soil deformation parameters and effective stress were considered, and a finite element numerical model was established to simulate and predict land subsidence caused by high-rise building loads and groundwater exploitation. The effects of the coupled processes on land subsidence were also examined. The results showed that the greatest land subsidence (466.82 mm) occurred in Suning County. Land subsidence generally decreased from west to east and was consistent with the degree of groundwater exploitation. Subsidence funnels were generally distributed in county and city centers. The coupling effect was dependent on the groundwater exploitation of shallow aquifers and increased as the exploitation of these aquifers increased.

AB  - The measured values of river health indexes that are not necessarily in the same range of a certain health grade level cause the problem of how to classify the actual status of river health. To solve such incompatibility and evaluate the health condition of a river ecosystem objectively we can use the river health integrated index (RHI), which was determined by the fuzzy matter-element extension assessment model (FMEAM). FMEAM was established by combining the fuzzy matter-element extension assessment method with the proposed aggregative index system. By employing the model above, as well as data from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, we evaluated the health state of the Luanhe River. The results showed that the Luanhe River was in a sub-healthy state in the 1980s and in an unhealthy state in the 1990s and 2000s. The reasons leading to the Luanhe River's health degradation have been analyzed. Among them, water conservation projects' building and operations are the major influence factors. Waste water emissions, the expansion of urban built-up areas, over exploitation of groundwater, and other unreasonable human activities also intensified the river ecosystem degradation. Finally, countermeasures for the ecological restoration and protection of the river were put forward.

AB  - Reasonable estimates of groundwater recharge and discharge through evapotranspiration is critical for sustainable water resources management in shallow water table areas. The hydrologic processes are highly interactive between the vadose zone and groundwater under shallow water table conditions. In traditional groundwater flow models, the recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes are often oversimplified as a simple sink/source term. However, the recharge and evapotranspiration are observed to vary with topography, soil type, land use, and water management practices. Additionally, they are known to vary temporally and spatially and are difficult to estimate, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Thus, it is important to devise an appropriate method to estimate the recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes in groundwater modeling. In this study, a Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) package was integrated into a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW) in such a way that the SWAP package calculates vertical flux for MODFLOW, while MODFLOW provides averaged water table depth to determine the bottom boundary condition for SWAP zones. The SWAP zones in MODFLOW are derived from a combination of topology, soil type, land use, water management practices using geographic information systems (GIS). Then the MODFLOW with SWAP package was tested using a two-dimensional saturated-unsaturated water table recharge experiment. Results showed that the simulated water table elevations matched well with the observed ones except at the early period during which they were slightly higher than the observed ones, probably due to neglecting lateral diffusion in the unsaturated zone. Finally, we applied MODFLOW with SWAP package to simulate a regional groundwater flow problem in Hetao Irrigation District, upper Yellow River basin of North China. The simulation results validated the applicability of the developed MODFLOW with SWAP package for practical regional groundwater modeling. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Improving the efficiency of water consumption and water productivity is the key approach to satisfy sustainable water resource supply and food demand. As effective measures, water saving practices are implemented in arid and semi-arid regions. For areas with shallow groundwater, water used for irrigation is not entirely consumptively used. The majority of irrigation water infiltrations below the root zone are stored in shallow groundwater. This can be reused as groundwater based evapotranspiration (ETg) at the regional scale. Thus, actual regional efficiency of water consumption (REWC) based on all water within the hydrological system is greater than based on consumptive use only. Accurately evaluating the response of REWC and regional water productivity (RWP) to water saving practices is essential due to the complexity of the hydrological system. In this study, regional ETg and regional evapotranspiration (ET) of the past 20 years were reproduced in a typical arid irrigation district with shallow groundwater based on the water balance method. Furthermore, REWC and RWP were estimated to investigate the impact of water saving practices to regional water use. Simulation results show that groundwater is a significant water source of regional ET in arid regions with a shallow aquifer and contributes more than 16% of regional ET for the irrigation district. Water saving practice implementation enhances the contribution of groundwater to ET. After water saving practices implementation, annual REWC and RWP have been improved by 0.07 and 0.1 kg/m(3), respectively. Furthermore, negative correlation between REWC and I + P (the total water supply including rainfall and irrigation water diversion) and positive correlation between RWP and REWC demonstrate that water saving practices can reduce the non-beneficial water losses by evaporation and enhance productivity by a lower groundwater table. Overall, shallow groundwater plays an important role to enhance REWC and RWP and the contribution of groundwater to regional water use needs to be considered as part of a reasonable water saving strategy towards a sustainable agricultural system.

AB  - In the Hetao Irrigation District (HID), reduction of the diverted Yellow River water for agriculture makes partial replacement of fresh water for irrigation by shallow saline groundwater a possible way to alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources. In this study, a SWAP-WOFOST agro-hydrological model was calibrated and validated, and then applied in a distributed manner to estimate crop yield, water productivity (WP) of spring wheat, spring maize, and sunflower, and soil salinity with conjunctive use of saline and non-saline irrigation water during 2000-2010, and a crop zoning was proposed based on simulated crop WP in the HID. Compared with non-saline water irrigation, the annual average yield of spring wheat, spring maize, and sunflower was changed by -0.2, 5.3, and 8.2%, and the WP was changed by -5.5, 2.6, and 7.6%, respectively, with conjunctive use of saline and non-saline irrigation water according to the proposed crop zoning. Soil salinity in the rooting zone did not increase with time. The salts remaining in the subsoil were very little, which did not obviously affect the groundwater salinity. Our results demonstrated that partial substitution of fresh water by shallow saline groundwater for irrigation is feasible in the HID. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Data-based models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), genetic programming (GP) and extreme learning machine (ELM), were developed to approximate three-dimensional, density-dependent flow and transport processes in a coastal aquifer. A simulation model, SEAWAT, was used to generate data required for the training and testing of the data-based models. Statistical analysis of the simulation results obtained by the four models show that the data-based models could simulate the complex salt water intrusion process successfully. The selected models were also compared based on their computational ability, and the results show that the ELM is the fastest technique, taking just 0.5s to simulate the dataset; however, the SVM is the most accurate, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) >= 0.95 and correlation coefficient R >= 0.92 for all the wells. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the SVM is also significantly less, ranging from 12.28 to 77.61mg/L.

AB  - Groundwater is an important component of the global freshwater supply and is affected by climate. There is a strong need to understand and evaluate the impacts of climate change over the long term, in order to better plan and manage precious groundwater resources. Turkey, located in Mediterranean basin, is threatened by climate change. The purpose of this study was, through a quantitative overview, to determine the impacts of climate change on the groundwater recharge rates in Kucuk Menderes River Basin in western Turkey. According to the data of odemi and Selcuk meteorological stations located in the basin, there is a significantly decreasing trend in precipitation combined with increasing trends in temperature and evaporation observed in 1964-2011. The calculations of groundwater recharge with hydrologic budget method for the observation period showed an approximately 15% decline in groundwater recharge in the basin. Thus, the combined impacts of climate change and excessive groundwater pumping, due to increasing water demand, have caused a significant decline in groundwater levels. Consequently, the proper management of the groundwater resources threatened by climate change requires effective governance to both mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and facilitate the adaptation of sustainable integrated water management policies.

AB  - Global warming is likely to have significant effect on the hydrological cycle. Some parts of the world may see significant reductions in precipitation or major alterations in the timing of wet and dry seasons. Climate change is one of the serious pressures facing water resources and their management over the next few years and decades. As part of the southern belt of Mediterranean Europe, Turkey is highly vulnerable to anticipated climate change impacts. The changes in global climate will seriously affect inland freshwater ecosystems and coastal lakes. Mogan and Eymir Lakes located in Central Turkey are shallow lakes that may be impacted significantly by climate change. The interaction between the lakes and groundwater system has been modelled in order to analyse the response of lake levels to climate change over a planning period of 96 years, beginning from October 2004 and ending in September 2100. The impacts of the emission scenarios of A2 and B1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on lake levels have been analyzed with the help of the lake-aquifer simulation model. The fluctuations in lake levels due to climate change scenarios are compared with the results of a scenario generated by the assumption of the continuation of the average recharge and discharge conditions observed for 1999 and 2004. The results show that very small, but long-term changes to precipitation and temperature have the potential to cause significant declines in lake levels and temporary drying of the lakes in the long-term. The impact of climate change on lake levels will depend on how these water resources are managed in the future.

AB  - Calculation of the water balance is very important to relieve the pressure on water resources in arid agricultural irrigation areas. This research focused on irrigation water balance calculations in the Manas River Basin of the southern margin of the Junggar Basin of China, and aimed to analyze the groundwater level dynamic trend and response characteristics of the basin water cycle under water-saving irrigation measures. The surface water and groundwater coupling model of MIKE 11-Visual MODFLOW was used to simulate rainfall runoff in mountainous areas, and quantify the contribution of water balance components in the plain irrigation area. Convergence of the delayed watershed in the mountain area was obvious, and when the river runoff exceeded 200 m(3)/s, the error in the runoff simulation was large. The water balance in the plain agricultural irrigation area was in a negative equilibrium state, and the difference between recharge and discharge was -2.65 billion m(3). The evapotranspiration was 24.49 billion m(3) under drip irrigation, accounting for only approximately 51% of the total discharge. The lateral discharge of the unsaturated and saturated aquifers was 15.38 billion m(3), accounting for approximately 32% of the total discharge. The main reason for the groundwater decline in the irrigation area was closely related to the extraction of groundwater, because the amount of recharge and discharge in the natural state was approximately identical. The MIKE 11-Visual MODFLOW model produced accurate results, and the research method provided a new exploration technique to quantify the effect of water supply mode on the groundwater table. The model is suitable for the management of water resources in arid areas.

AB  - Soil moisture is an effective water source for plant growth in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. Characterizing the response of deep soil moisture to land use and afforestation is important for the sustainability of vegetation restoration in this region. In this paper, the dynamics of soil moisture were quantified to evaluate the effect of land use on soil moisture at a depth of 2 m. Specifically, the gravimetric soil moisture content was measured in the soil layer between 0 and 8 m for five land use types in the Longtan catchment of the western Loess Plateau. The land use types included traditional farmland, native grassland, and lands converted from traditional farmland (pasture grassland, shrubland and forestland). Results indicate that the deep soil moisture content decreased more than 35% after land use conversion, and a soil moisture deficit appeared in all types of land with introduced vegetation. The introduced vegetation decreased the soil moisture content to levels lower than the reference value representing no human impact in the entire 0-8 m soil profile. No significant differences appeared between different land use types and introduced vegetation covers, especially in deeper soil layers, regardless of which plant species were introduced. High planting density was found to be the main reason for the severe deficit of soil moisture. Landscape management activities such as tillage activities, micro-topography reconstruction, and fallowed farmland affected soil moisture in both shallow and deep soil layers. Tillage and micro-topography reconstruction can be used as effective countermeasures to reduce the soil moisture deficit due to their ability to increase soil moisture content. For sustainable vegetation restoration in a vulnerable semi-arid region, the plant density should be optimized with local soil moisture conditions and appropriate landscape management practices.

AB  - The traditional concepts of water resource development and utilization have caused serious hydrological and environmental issues in some regions. In addition, policy issues in China have led to a severe water crisis. The quantitative accounting of water resources is a theoretical approach to solving these problems. In this paper, 13 indicators were selected from four classes, including resources, the environment, society, and efficiency, and a case study of Jinan, Shandong Province, was performed using a set pair analysis model to calculate the water resource assets from 2011-2015. In previous methods of water resource accounting, the water quality was not considered; therefore, the loss coefficient of water resource assets was proposed to improve the reliability of accounting. According to the relationships among the unit price of water, water quantity, and water quality, physical and quantitative accounting methods were used to create water balance sheets from 2011-2015. The calculation results showed that the physical change in water resource assets in Jinan City was 30 million m(3), and water resource assets initially increased and then decreased. In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, water resource assets totalled 36.5 million USD, 45.9 million USD, 66.7 million USD, 35.5 million USD, and 37.5 million USD, respectively (at 6.4588, 6.3125, 6.1932, 6.2166, 6.2284 USRMB, respectively). This initial accounting provides quantitative and physical support for the improved management of water resources.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, a close relationship exists between groundwater and supergene eco-environmental issues such as swampiness, soil salinization, desertification, vegetation degradation, reduction of stream base flow, and disappearance of lakes and wetlands. When the maximum allowable withdrawal of groundwater (AWG) is assessed, an ecology-oriented regional groundwater resource assessment (RGRA) method should be used. In this study, a hierarchical assessment index system of the supergene eco-environment was established based on field survey data and analysis of the supergene eco-environment factors influenced by groundwater in the Tuwei River watershed, Shaanxi Province, China. The assessment system comprised 11 indices, including geomorphological type, lithology and structure of the vadose zone, depth of the water table (DWT), total dissolved solids content of groundwater, etc. Weights for all indices were calculated using an analytical hierarchy process. Then, the current eco-environmental conditions were assessed using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE). Under the imposed constraints, and using both the assessment results on the current eco-environment situation and the ecological constraint of DWT (1.5-5.0 m), the maximum AWG (0.408 x 10(8) m(3)/a or 24.29 % of the river base flow) was determined. This was achieved by combining the groundwater resource assessment with the supergene eco-environmental assessment based on FCE. If the maximum AWG is exceeded in a watershed, the eco-environment will gradually deteriorate and produce negative environmental effects. The ecology-oriented maximum AWG can be determined by the ecology-oriented RGRA method, and thus sustainable groundwater use in similar watersheds in other arid and semi-arid regions can be achieved.

AB  - The interactions between groundwater and surface water have been significantly affected by human activities in the semi-arid Hailiutu catchment, northwest China. Several methods were used to investigate the spatial and temporal interactions between groundwater and surface water. Isotopic and chemical analyses of water samples determined that groundwater discharges to the Hailiutu River, and mass balance equations were employed to estimate groundwater seepage rates along the river using chemical profiles. The hydrograph separation method was used to estimate temporal variations of groundwater discharges to the river. A numerical groundwater model was constructed to simulate groundwater discharges along the river and to analyze effects of water use in the catchment. The simulated seepage rates along the river compare reasonably well with the seepage estimates derived from a chemical profile in 2012. The impacts of human activities (river-water diversion and groundwater abstraction) on the river discharge were analyzed by calculating the differences between the simulated natural groundwater discharge and the measured river discharge. Water use associated with the Hailiutu River increased from 1986 to 1991, reached its highest level from 1992 to 2000, and decreased from 2001 onwards. The reduction of river discharge might have negative impacts on the riparian ecosystem and the water availability for downstream users. The interactions between groundwater and surface water as well as the consequences of human activities should be taken into account when implementing sustainable water resources management in the Hailiutu catchment.

AB  - This study used stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes as natural tracers to investigate their isotopic composition in precipitation, and in shallow and deep groundwater in the Penghu Islands in the Taiwan Strait. We aimed to understand the differences and relationships in isotope compositions within various water bodies and to evaluate the source of groundwater recharge. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of sampled groundwater are mainly distributed along the meteoric water line in the Penghu Islands, the variations in the distribution range being minor (the delta D values are distributed from -48.2% to -37.7%, with a mean value of -43.14 +/- 2.4%; the delta O-18 values are distributed from -6.96% to -5.46%, with a mean value of -6.34 +/- 0.34%). The data suggest that the groundwater is sourced mainly from local precipitation. In addition, a comparison of the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of groundwater and precipitation in Taiwan shows that the delta values for groundwater are distributed between those for precipitation during the northeast monsoon and the southwest monsoon seasons. However, some of the delta values trends towards the isotopic composition of the precipitation during the southwest monsoon season. Thus, the source of groundwater may have a closer association with precipitation during this time.

AB  - Groundwater resource investigations primarily involve inferring groundwater levels and recharge sources from factors such as the distributed location and range, subsurface geological structure, and flow paths of groundwater sources. This study conducted an investigation on the underground aquifer at the downstream of the Chih-Ben Creek basin, Taiwan. In addition, convenient, rapid, and accurate two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was employed for evaluations. The cross-sectional ERT image indicates that the low-resistivity region in the stratum at survey line CB01 may be a groundwater deposit or fracture zone. This region can be divided into three major segments. The segment that is 0-50 m from the survey line exhibits a decreasing trend and is thus inferred to be a recharge source. Survey line CB02 can be generally divided into four layers, with the second layer containing a greater amount of groundwater. This layer is an aquifer with a depth of approximately 25-100 m below the ground surface and 75-100 m in thickness. The base of the aquifer slopes toward the east and primarily possesses a lithological composition of slate and sandstone with explicit and fractured joints.

AB  - A groundwater flow simulation model was developed using available hydrogeological data to describe groundwater flow in the Afram Plains area. A nonlinear optimization model was then developed and solved for the management of groundwater resources to meet irrigation and household needs. The objective was to maximize groundwater extraction from the shallow aquifers of the southern Voltaian Sedimentary Basin that underly the area, for irrigation activities. This would improve food security, raise the standard of living and ultimately help towards poverty alleviation in the rural communities that constitute the Afram Plains district. The calibrated flow model is in tandem with the general hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the area and fits the observed data with about 98% degree of confidence. The study reveals that groundwater resources, if fully developed, may not be the limiting factor in the development of the irrigation industry, and has tremendous potential to meet current and future irrigation needs. Six groundwater management periods (January 2007-December 2013) were used for the study, with the quantity of irrigable land available, and the groundwater level drawdown as the main constraints that limit the maximization of groundwater extraction from wells for irrigation and household purposes. Maize was used as the single irrigation crop because maize appears to be the staple food and farmers are familiar with it in the area. It was determined from this pilot study, that profit from maize irrigation in the Afram Plains area could rise from US$ 301,000 in 2007 to over US$ 3.5million at the end of the last management period (2013) as irrigation practice is improved, and the economic strength to increase the acreage for irrigation improves. Even with these margins of profit, the drawdown constraint was not reached in any of the management periods. It is expected that recharge from the irrigation water would reclaim the lost hydraulic head. The single significant constraint was the amount of land area that could be developed for irrigation in the area. The profit obtained per unit cubic meter of water used also improved over the same management period.

AB  - A steady state groundwater flow simulation model was developed using available well data and general hydrogeological and geological information, for the Afram Plains area, Ghana. The hydrochemistry of groundwater from wells in the area was then evaluated to determine its suitability for irrigation and domestic uses. The assessment of the irrigation quality of groundwater from this area was based on salinity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratios (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), and permeability indices (PI). The simulation model reveals that groundwater in the Afram Plains area generally flows from the midsections in the neighborhood of Tease and surrounding areas, where significant recharge takes place, to the outer regions and discharges into the Volta Lake in the southern and eastern sections of the area. Flow magnitude and piezometric maps suggest that there is probably of less potential for groundwater extraction for sustainable irrigation in the central regions of the area, when compared to the other discharge areas. This study reveals that more than 70% of the samples analyzed fall within the C2-S1 category, referring to the medium level salinity and low sodium. Medium salinity waters may be used for irrigation on coarse textured soils with good permeability. About 15% of the data fall within the C3-S2 category, referring to water of high salinity and medium sodicity. High salinity, medium sodicity irrigation water cannot be used on fine-grained soils where drainage is restricted. This is because restricted flow is likely to result in the accumulation of salts in the root zones of crops, leading to salinity and soil clogging crisis. About 3% falls within the C3-S3 (high salinity, high sodicity) category. This category requires special soil management including improved drainage, heavy leaching and the use of chemical amendments on the water. Only one point plots within the extreme salinity-sodicity range. Concentrations of fluoride, arsenic and other natural elements in the area generally fall well within the world health standards for domestic water.

AB  - The efficient use of water resources in arid region has become highly relevant in the evaluation and mining planning, since the exploration phase to closure. The objective of the numerical groundwater model was to assess the potential for groundwater extraction to meet mine water demand from one of the driest area in the world. Numerical groundwater models were used to assess groundwater resource. Modelling was undertaken using MODFLOW-SURFACT code, an advanced MODFLOW based code, within the framework of Visual MODFLOW version 4.6. A steady state model was developed to assess the regional groundwater flow pattern and to calibrate the recharge and hydraulic conductivity parameters in the model. The model was calibrated with a correlation of coefficient of 0.997, and root-mean-squared error is 0.3 m. A transient simulation model was used to predict the impact of 1.5 million cubic metre/year extraction for 10 years on the main aquifer hydrogeological regime, including after cession of pumping. Modelling simulated four hydrogeological scenarios. Model results for the 'worst case' scenario suggested that the Saq Sandstone aquifer should be capable of supplying the mine water demand (1.5 million cubic metre (MCM)/year) for 10 years. However, the long-term water-level drawdown shows a continuous decrease without achieving steady state conditions; thus, the majority of water is being taken from aquifer storage, and in the long term, there will be a mutual interference from a borefield located to the north of the model area. In this area, the hydraulic gradient is relatively steep and over-pumped for more than 28 years. Other scenario shows that there will be a recovery of around 8 m out of the 11.6-m drawdown, after 18 years of cession of pumping, implying that the aquifer will be stressed and a large percentage of water taken from aquifer storage. To minimise hydrogeological impacts, it is recommended to laterally spread out production bores, bores should be located where the Saq Sandstone is deepest, and operate the bores at low extraction rates. Overall, this study presents a useful numerical model output for mine water supply assessment and will contribute towards improving water resources management under different conditions in one of the world driest area.

AB  - A groundwater resources assessment has been carried out for the Lake Nyasa Basin east Africa, with reference to sub catchments further to the whole basin wise analysis, including quantification of potential yields from the aquifers. Numerical groundwater models, MODFLOW-SURFACT coupled with Visual MODFLOW, were used to assess sub-basin groundwater sustainability (Via "Zone Budget" software package). The model has been calibrated to observed hydraulic head and processed baseflow estimate. It is concluded that the aquifer system is sustained by episodic recharge and the long-term gaining storage which represents the maximum extractable volume. Future predictions of groundwater usage indicate that by 2035 the percentage of annual safe yield extracted will increase to between 11.3 and 103%. Model result suggests that there is a need to revise the current estimate of sustainable yield based on future climate change conditions and projected population growth, which would decrease spring flows substantially and decrease hydraulic head basin-wide. It also suggests that by 2035 some sub catchments will be nearly at or exceeding the annual safe yield leaving no room for socio-economic development, or the need to reduce existing socio-economic demands to meet domestic demands. Besides to improving the natural replenishment capacity through artificial recharge technique, the other option is to increase the percentage of total recharge allocated to the annual safe yield from 10% of the total annual recharge to 20% in these catchments. This provides a basis for management of individual groundwater scheme in sustaining livelihood activities or implications of policies and to develop a plan for potential groundwater extraction scenarios pertaining to water use and allocation.

AB  - Effective integrated water resources management requires reliable estimation of an overall basin water budget and of hydrologic fluctuations between groundwater and surface-water resources. Seasonal variability of groundwater-surface water exchange fluxes impacts on the water balance. The long term lake water balance was calculated by Modflow using the stage-volume rating curve of Lake Package LAK3. The long term average storage volume change is 8.4 x 10(8) m(3)/month. The lake water balances suggests that the lake is not in equilibrium with the inflow and outflow terms. Using field abstraction data analysis and model simulation, the combined volume of lake-groundwater used for industrial abstraction since the last three decades was estimated. This requires an average abstraction amount of 7.0x 10(6) m(3)/month with a long term trend of abstraction ratio 30% (groundwater) and 70% (lake water) since 1980. The amount resulted in a lake which might have been 4.8 m higher than was observed in the last stress period (2010). A long term regional groundwater budget is calculated reflecting all water flow in to and out of the regional aquifer. The model water balance suggests that lake Navaisha basin is in equilibrium with a net outflow about 1% greater than the inflow over the calibrated period of time (1932-2010). The regional model is best used for broad-scale predictions and can be used to provide a general sense of groundwater to surface water and groundwater to groundwater impacts in the basin. Abasin wide water resource management strategy can be designed by integrating the lake/wetland within the regional groundwater model to increase the level of sustainable production and good stewardship in Lake Navaisha. Such hydrological analysis is crucial in making the model serve as simulator of the response of lake stage to hydraulic stresses applied to the aquifer and variation in climatic condition.

AB  - Lake Naivasha was designated as a RAMSAR site in 1995. The lake environment is fragile and critically threatened by human-induced factors. The study presented a steady and transient numerical modeling. The long-term and system flux over time interaction between the lake and the surficial aquifer is represented in the Lake Package LAK3 with in the advanced 3-D simulation sofware (GMS). The model covers an area of 1817 km(2). Model calibration was constrained by the observed groundwater and lake levels using PEST. The effect of excessive abstraction was rigorously analyzed via scenario analysis. The simulation was evaluated "with abstraction'' and "without abstraction'' scenarios. The abstraction scenario was simulated using range of combination assuming that all the abstraction was from the lake or the groundwater and in the ratio of groundwater and lake water. The effect of the stress was evaluated based on the observed aquifer heads and lake stage at the end of the simulation time. The development of low groundwater-level anomalies in the well field is explained. The result indicates that the one of the well fields is not in direct hydraulic connection to the main recharging water body. Apparently, similar development of cone of depression was not generated in the other two well fields, and this could have several reasons including due to the fact that these well fields are located relatively close by to the main recharging zones and concluded to have additional source of recharge, and this was supported by previous studies, whereby the isotopic composition of the boreholes has their source of recharge from precipitation and river and was also confirmed from the isotopic composition of unsaturated zone, which is a mixture of river and rain. The study reveals that seasonal variability of groundwater-surface water exchange fluxes and its spatially and temporally variable impact substantially on the water resource availability. Such analysis can be used as a basis to quantify the linkages between the surface water and groundwater regime and impacts in the basin. The model output is expected to serve as a basis via linking/coupling with others to incorporate the ecology and biodiversity of the lake to safeguard this high- value world heritage water feature.

AB  - This paper presents the assessment of sustainable yield in the Huaibei karst water area of Anhui province, China. A review of sustainable yield definition is introduced first in this paper, and sustainable development in karst areas is more difficult due to the complicated hydrogeologic conditions. General hydrogeology of the study area is provided to characterize hydraulic connections between the karst aquifer and an overlying porous aquifer. Groundwater level declines continuously due to over-exploitation of the karst groundwater, and two layers of groundwater dropping funnel were formed in Huaibei. These problems not only threaten the eco-geo-environment, but also compromise the water utilization which depends on the shallow porous water. A "critical water level" is proposed in this study to assess the sustainable yield, and it is determined by the historical exploitation data which represent the relationship between the karst water and the shallow porous water uses. A three layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is used to understand the complex relationship of the karst water level and its influencing factors. Precipitation, exploitation and water level of latest period are chosen as the input nodes, seasonal records of water level are simulated by the ANN model. The sustainable yield is calculated by the trail-and-error adjusting method, and is equal to the pumping rate when the "critical water level" is maintained. The rate of 30.05 MCM/a is the sustainable yield for the Huaibei karst area in 2008, and it is less than the real pumping rate of 35.92 MCM/a. This assessment is meaningful to the management for the Huaibei karst water.

AB  - The understanding of the interaction between groundwater and trees is vital for sustainable groundwater use and maintenance of a healthy ecosystem in arid regions. The short- and long-term groundwater contribution to tree water use was investigated using the HYDRUS-1D model and stable isotopes. For the short-term simulation, the ratio between the actual transpiration (T-a) and potential transpiration (T-p) approached almost similar to 1.0 due to the constant groundwater uptake. The results from the short-term simulation indicated that the groundwater contribution to tree water use ranged between 53% and 56% in the dry season (May-June) and 16-19% in the wet period (August-September). Isotopic analysis indicated that groundwater contributed to 45% of plant water use in the dry season, decreasing to 4-12% during the wet period. Because of canopy interception and transpiration, groundwater recharge only occurred after heavy rainfall and accounted for 3-8% of the total heavy rainfall. For the long-term simulation, T-a/T-p ranged between 0.91 and 1.00 except in 2007 (0.78), when the water table declined because of groundwater abstraction. In the scenario simulation for deep water table conditions caused by anthropogenic activities, T-a/T-p ranged between 0.09 and 0.40 (mean = 0.22) that is significantly lower than the values in the natural conditions. In conclusion, vegetation restoration in arid zones should be cautious as over-planting of trees will decrease the groundwater recharge and potentially cause a rapid drop in water table levels, which in turn may result in the death of planted trees. Trees adapt to arid regions by adopting root patterns that allow soil water uptake by shallow roots and groundwater use by deep roots, thus climatic variation itself may not bring severe negative impact on trees. However, anthropogenic activities, such as groundwater abstraction, will result in significant water table decline that will reduce actual transpiration of trees significantly according to the results from the scenario simulation.

AB  - In this study, a new evaluation method for the water supply safety of a dam is proposed. This method considers both climatic conditions and storage characteristics of a dam. The annual variation of dam storage is represented by a broken-line model, the lines of which are determined by only three-factors: the monthly design water supply during the dry period; dam storage at the end of the dry period; and changes in dam storage during the wet period. From the results of bivariate frequency analysis, a unique broken-line model is derived under multiple scenarios with the given return periods for the evaluation of water supply. The proposed method is applied to a total of five major dams in Korea. It is shown that the water supply safety of a dam can be quantified by using the concept of the return period, and five major dams have water supply safety corresponding to return periods of 10-50 years. Among them, the Soyanggang Dam is found to be the most stable with respect to water supply safety in Korea. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) level two (L2) data is used in estimating the groundwater storage changes (GWSC) in the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS). This set of data consists of spherical harmonics coefficients with specific degree and order. The GRACE data is decorrelated using a sixth degree polynomial in order to reduce the effect of the noise error resulting from the correlation between the spherical harmonics coefficients with the same degree parity. The GRACE estimates of GWSC are smoothed using Gaussian filter with half width of 1000 km. This half width is chosen in order to maximize the correlation between the GRACE estimates of GWSC and previous modeling results of the NSAS. The loss in groundwater storage occurring in each of the four countries sharing the NSAS is calculated to assess the sustainability of using the NSAS as a water resource in each country. The over-arching finding in this study is that NSAS is losing its groundwater storage at a very high rate. Also, it is found that Egypt is the fastest in losing its groundwater storage from the NSAS. This loss of groundwater storage in Egypt may not necessarily be resulting from in-country extractions because of the transboundary nature of this aquifer. The GRACE-based estimates are found to be close to available data and previous modeling results of the NSAS.

AB  - From ancient times, access to water in arid and hyper-arid regions has been crucial for life. Increased knowledge about groundwater conditions is therefore extremely important for the future development of desert areas. Gebel Duwi, a limestone ridge, sited in the today hyper-arid Eastern Desert of Egypt, was chosen for testing current hypotheses concerning the interdependence of palaeohydrologic features and geologic settings for groundwater investigations. Two sub-basins are identified in affecting Gebel Duwi: Wadi Nakheil and Wadi Sodmein. Both have extraordinary high stream order, indicating the reality of a very old drainage system. Several additional palaeohydrologic features such as wadi terraces, alluvial fans, and playa deposits are also recorded in these sub-basins. These features, as well as finds from an important archaeological site (Sodmein Cave), provide information about palaeoenvironmental changes and wetter climatic periods in the younger geologic past, mainly in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, which have affected the occurrence of present day groundwater. This study combines new results of geological and geomorphological field studies, examinations of digital elevation models, as well as of rock and water analyses in an integrated approach. Resulting maps comprise landforms, lithology, elevation, drainage lines slope, structural lineaments and flow directions. The hydrogeologic condition indicates suitable locations for groundwater recharge and accumulation. The research presented is interdisciplinary in approach and is recommended for future studies with regard to groundwater exploration, sustainable groundwater use, and the protection of archaeological sites in arid lands.

AB  - Water resources assessment in arid lands is of a particular interest, not only in scientific terms, but also under the concept of sustainable development. The study area (El Ambagi basin), represents a remote arid area with a scarcity of data. The measured effective porosity and permeability revealed high potentialities of the Nubian sandstone and Oligocene sediments. The hydrogeologic setting indicates favorable conditions for groundwater accumulation where there is an opportunity of recharge, and thus, the sustainability of the groundwater. The research approach is based on geological investigations as well as several data layers in the GIS environment including landforms, lithology, slope, soil, morphometric parameters, structural lineaments, and geophysical data. Several specific sites were suggested as targets for future groundwater explorations. The studied basin contains four sub-basins which have an intensive drainage network. The morphometric parameters revealed that they have potential for surface runoff occurrence and also for groundwater recharge. Two of the investigated sub-basins show high hazard degrees and should be protected to avoid flash floods. The estimated runoff volume from a single rainfall event (27 mm) can reach 3316.42 x 10(3) m(3). Hence, management of rainwater harvesting and protection measures against flash floods are necessary. A future water resources management strategy, based on results of the multidisciplinary study, is proposed.

AB  - Hydrogeological investigations in arid regions are particularly important to support sustainable development. The study area, El Daba'a in northwestern Egypt, faces scarce water resources as a result of reported climate change that particularly affects the southern Mediterranean coast and increases stress on the local groundwater reserves. This change in climate affects the area in terms of drought, over-pumping and unregulated exploration of groundwater for irrigation purposes. The hydrogeological investigation is based on a multidisciplinary data-layer analysis that includes geomorphology, geology, slope, drainage lines, soil type, structural lineaments, subsurface data, stable isotopes, and chemical analyses. The study area contains Pleistocene and middle Miocene marine limestone aquifers. Based on lithology and microfacies analysis, the middle Miocene aquifer is subdivided into two waterbearing zones. The area is affected by sets of faults and anticline folds, and these structures are associated with fractures and joints that increase permeability and facilitate the recharge of groundwater. Stable isotope data indicate that groundwater of both the Pleistocene and middle Miocene aquifers is recharged by modern precipitation. The high salinity values observed in some groundwater wells that tap both aquifers could be attributed to leaching and dissolution processes of marine salts from the aquifers' marine limestone matrix. In addition, human activities can also contribute to an increase in groundwater salinity. A future water exploration strategy, based on the results from the multidisciplinary data-layer analysis, is proposed for the area. The derived scientific approach is transferable to other arid coastal areas with comparable conditions.

AB  - The formation of earth fissures due to groundwater depletion has been reported in many places in North America, Europe, and Asia. Najran Basin is in the southern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and agricultural activities and other groundwater uses have caused significant groundwater depletion there. The basin recently experienced a sudden appearance of numerous earth fissures. An interdisciplinary study consisting of an evaluation of land-use changes, and hydrological, hydrogeological, and geophysical investigations was conducted to determine the reason for the formation of the earth fissures. The hydrological analysis strongly revealed that the groundwater level is decreasing with time. Groundwater depletion would lead to the accumulation of subsurface stress, causing soil hydro-consolidation which creates the ideal condition for the formation of earth fissures. Electrical resistivity, data indicated that there are anomalies in the profiles, which are most probably due to the presence of subsurface topography, another key factor for the formation of the earth fissures.

AB  - It is well known that obtaining optimal solutions for groundwater management models with covariates is a challenging task, especially for dynamic planning and management. Here, a theory and method of dealing with mutual-feed joint variation in groundwater management models is described. Specifically, an equation expressing the inherent connection between covariates and groundwater level was developed. This equation was integrated into a mathematical simulation model of groundwater, after which a groundwater dynamic optimization management model with covariates was constructed using the state transition equation method and solved with differential dynamic programming algorithms. Finally, the above theory and method were applied to a hypothetical groundwater system. For the same groundwater system, a groundwater management model with covariates was developed and the results of the two optimization methods were found to be nearly identical, which validated the theory and methods put forth here.

AB  - The Amsterdam area, a highly manipulated delta area formed by polders and reclaimed lakes, struggles with high nutrient levels in its surface water system. The polders receive spatially and temporally variable amounts of water and nutrients via surface runoff, groundwater seepage, sewer leakage, and via water inlets from upstream polders. Diffuse anthropogenic sources, such as manure and fertiliser use and atmospheric deposition, add to the water quality problems in the polders. The major nutrient sources and pathways have not yet been clarified due to the complex hydrological system in lowland catchments with both urban and agricultural areas. In this study, the spatial variability of the groundwater seepage impact was identified by exploiting the dense groundwater and surface water monitoring networks in Amsterdam and its surrounding polders. A total of 25 variables (concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), NH4, NO3, HCO3, SO4, Ca, and Cl in surface water and groundwater, N and P agricultural inputs, seepage rate, elevation, land-use, and soil type) for 144 polders were analysed statistically and interpreted in relation to sources, transport mechanisms, and pathways. The results imply that groundwater is a large source of nutrients in the greater Amsterdam mixed urban-agricultural catchments. The groundwater nutrient concentrations exceeded the surface water environmental quality standards (EQSs) in 93% of the polders for TP and in 91% for TN. Groundwater outflow into the polders thus adds to nutrient levels in the surface water. High correlations (R-2 up to 0.88) between solutes in groundwater and surface water, together with the close similarities in their spatial patterns, confirmed the large impact of groundwater on surface water chemistry, especially in the polders that have high seepage rates. Our analysis indicates that the elevated nutrient and bicarbonate concentrations in the groundwater seepage originate from the decomposition of organic matter in subsurface sediments coupled to sulfate reduction and possibly methanogenesis. The large loads of nutrient-rich groundwater seepage into the deepest polders indirectly affect surface water quality in the surrounding area, because excess water from the deep polders is pumped out and used to supply water to the surrounding infiltrating polders in dry periods. The study shows the importance of the connection between groundwater and surface water nutrient chemistry in the greater Amsterdam area. We expect that taking account of groundwater-surface water interaction is also important in other subsiding and urbanising deltas around the world, where water is managed intensively in order to enable agricultural productivity and achieve water-sustainable cities.

AB  - The flow regime of the Yangtze River (Changjiang) has been altered to some extent by intensified human activities over the past decades, particularly dam construction. To assess the impacts of dam building on the flow regime in the Yangtze River, two of the largest reservoirs on the upper reach, i.e.,the Gezhouba and Three Gorges reservoirs, have been selected as case study sites. To analyze the changes in flow regime between predam and postdam periods, the whole study period was divided into three subperiods according to the years when these two reservoirs started to store water. On the basis of the time series of daily flow discharge from four key hydrological stations, i.e.,Cuntan, Yichang, Hankou, and Datong, the alterations in annual, seasonal, monthly, and daily flow regimes and water rising or falling regime in different subperiods were investigated and the driving forces were explored. The results revealed the impacts of the two reservoirs on their downstream flow regime varied with reservoir storage capacity and the distance between the target reservoir and the case study site, the Gezhouba and Three Gorges reservoirs imposed various impacts on different time scales of downstream runoff regime, and the operation of these two reservoirs altered the water rising and falling regime to some degree, which is particularly critical for the spawning of Chinese sturgeon and the four major domestic carp. The output of the paper could provide references for the assessment of impacts of dam construction on the health and stability of the Yangtze River ecosystem.

AB  - Estimation of hydraulic parameters is a critical step during design of foundation dewatering works. When many piles are installed in an aquifer, estimation of the hydraulic conductivity should consider the blocking of groundwater seepage by the piles. Based on field observations during a dewatering project in Shanghai, hydraulic conductivities are back-calculated using a numerical model considering the actual position of each pile. However, it is difficult to apply the aforementioned model directly in field due to requirement to input each pile geometry into the model. To develop a simple numerical model and find the optimal hydraulic conductivity, three scenarios are examined, in which the soil mass containing the piles is considered to be a uniform porous media. In these three scenarios, different sub-regions with different hydraulic conductivities, based on either automatic inverted calculation, or on effective medium theory (EMT), are established. The results indicate that the error, in the case which determines the hydraulic conductivity based on EMT, is less than that determined in the automatic inversion case. With the application of EMT, only the hydraulic conductivity of the soil outside the pit should be inverted. The soil inside the pit with its piles is divided into sub-regions with different hydraulic conductivities, and the hydraulic conductivity is calculated according to the volume ratio of the piles. Thus, the use of EMT in numerical modelling makes it easier to consider the effect of piles installed in an aquifer.

AB  - Water saving practices are essential for sustainable use of water resources in semiarid regions. To understand the impacts of different water saving measures on groundwater resources, the Hetao Irrigation District in Northwest China was chosen in this study. Based on the data from 1991 to 2010, a groundwater balance model was calibrated and validated. The simulation results showed that irrigation-induced infiltration (92 % of the total groundwater recharge) and groundwater evaporation (92 % of the total groundwater discharge) were the primary factors controlling groundwater table fluctuations during irrigation seasons. The impacts of different water saving scenarios on groundwater balance components were then evaluated. The results revealed that the conjunctive use of water resources was the most effective way to improve water use efficiency (reducing surface water diversions by 52 %) and the depth to groundwater table increased by up to 79 cm. However, deeper groundwater tables may have a negative effect on crop growth due to reduced upward fluxes of groundwater into root zones. Therefore, future studies are needed to evaluate the impacts of different water saving measures on both water resources and crop yields. The results of this study provide further insights into effectively managing water resources in water-limited agricultural areas.

AB  - The sustainability of groundwater resources has been a central issue in the Upper Guadiana Basin (Spain) since two of its primary aquifer units were declared overexploited at the end of the 1990s. Three hydrogeological aquifer units located to the north of the primary aquifers have rarely been studied because of their low economic value, despite a large part of the wetlands of La Mancha HA(0)meda Biosphere Reserve overlying the Basin. This report presents the foundations upon which conceptual and numerical models of the Upper Guadiana Basin are based. An evaluation of the sustainability of the groundwater use in Upper Guadiana Basin has been also carried out. The effect of five management options and a simplified climatic-change scenario have been considered for the three northern aquifers. A decrease in the net recharge, a change in river-aquifer interactions, and the total abstraction volumes authorised have been identified as the main factors to address in management planning. In addition, the expected recovery in the primary Western Mancha aquifer is shown to have little correlation with the total volume abstracted from the three northern tributary aquifers.

AB  - Wetlands constitute a significant source of life since they incorporate unique habitats with endemic and migrant species. They also contribute to the preservation of high global biodiversity and they are under protection according to EU legislation. Nevertheless, during the last century, significant degradation has been observed in wetlands, mainly due to intensification of agriculture and poor water management practices. Calcareous fens habitat with the endangered species Cladium mariscus and Carex spp. is an ecologically significant wetland that undergoes great ecological stresses globally, due to the irrational use of water resources. In Trichonis lake, Western Greece, this habitat has been under deterioration during the last 50 years due to the lack of a sustainable water management plan that has caused destabilization of the hydrologic balance and high water level fluctuations. This human induced hydrologic regime has led to seasonal shifting between drought and flooding which constitute unfavorable conditions for this fen habitat and as a result significant elimination of this ecosystem extent has occurred. This study has adopted technologically advanced scientific methods such as GIS applications and remote sensing techniques to quantify the existing water resources and formulate a sustainable management scheme by considering both anthropogenic water uses and environmental protection.

AB  - This paper applies optimal-control theory to develop groundwater exploitation strategies that account for potential climate change patterns in Brazil. Numerical experiments showed that whether climate change only affects groundwater quantity or whether it affects both groundwater quantity and quality, Brazilian water institutions will be able to implement optimal, equitable groundwater management strategies. However, they may be unable to achieve justice between current generations, while the economic, social, and environmental sustainability is likely to be favoured by a large regional groundwater availability. Institutional sustainability is ensured by the principles and institutions established by Brazil's 1988 Constitution and by Law 9.433/97. Some sources of misunderstandings between managers and the research community are dealt with by suggesting directly applicable management strategies that accommodate stakeholder perceptions and desires. Some potential water policies based on the modelling results are discussed, with water conservation and water subsidies turning out to be beneficial for current and detrimental for future generations, respectively; in contrast, current generations paying for water at its social opportunity cost and being more concerned for future generations would benefit current generations.

AB  - Halayieb area is located at the southeastern corner on the border between Egypt and Sudan. The area has very important strategic aspects to Egypt. Groundwater is the only source of fresh water in the area. The hydrogeochemical characterizations of groundwater in the area were carried out, to assess the quality of groundwater for its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes. Geologically the Precambrian rocks underlain the Mesozoic sandstone and Tertiary marine sediments. The groundwater of the area is recorded at the Miocene sedimentary succession and the fractured basement aquifers with a maximum water depth of 26.5 m from the ground surface. Groundwater quality is mostly saline caused by the sources of geogenic, anthropogenic, and marine origin of the water bearing formations. The resulting groundwater is characterized by Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+/Cl- > HCO3- > SO42-: Na+ > Ca2+ > K+/SO42- > Cl- > HCO3- facies, following the topographical and water flow-path conditions. The hydrochemical facies in this area fall in the field of NaCl type and the hydrogeochemical signatures indicated active hydrolysis and dissolution process of Ca-bearing minerals of the basement rocks and some sodium is lost, most probably through reverse ion exchange. Enrichment of Mn+ in some wells is regarded to the mining activity for manganese ores in the area. Groundwater quality is mostly not suitable for drinking purposes. For irrigation, the groundwater is mostly suitable in regard to the residual sodium carbonate and the magnesium hazard. According to the water quality assessment using United States salinity laboratory (USLL) diagram, most water samples located in category C3-S2, C3-S3, C3-S4, C4-S2 highlighting high to very high salinity hazard and medium to very high sodium content class. Most of the groundwater samples that are located away from the shoreline are suitable for livestock and poultry consumption. High salinity contents in the study area create severe problems for using water supplies and for future exploitation.

AB  - It is important to predict how groundwater levels in an aquifer will respond to various climate change scenarios to effectively plan for how groundwater resources will be used in the future. Due to the overuse of groundwater resources and the multi-year drought in the Kerdi-Shirazi plain in Iran, some land subsidence and a drop in groundwater levels has taken place, and without active management, further degradation of the groundwater resource is possible under predicted future climate change scenarios in the country. To determine the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater levels in the region, the groundwater model GMS was coupled with the atmospheric circulation model HADCM3 using scenarios A1B, A2 and B1 for the period 2016-2030. The results of the climate modelling suggest that the Kerdi-Shirazi plain will experience an increase in minimum temperature and maximum temperature of, respectively, between 0.03 and 0.47, and 0.32-0.45 A degrees C for this time period. The results of the groundwater modelling suggest that water levels on the Kerdi-Shirazi plain will continue to decline over the forecast period with decreases of 34.51, 36.57 and 33.58 m being predicted, respectively, for climate scenarios A1B, A2 and B1. Consequently, groundwater resources in the Kerdi-Shirazi plain will urgently need active management to minimize the effects of ongoing water level decline and to prevent saltwater intrusion and desertification in the region.

AB  - Knowledge of aquifer thickness is crucial for setting up numerical groundwater flow models to support groundwater resource management and control. Fresh groundwater reserves in coastal aquifers are particularly under threat of salinization and depletion as a result of climate change, sea-level rise, and excessive groundwater withdrawal under urbanization. To correctly assess the possible impacts of these pressures we need better information about subsurface conditions in coastal zones. Here, we propose a method that combines available global datasets to estimate, along the global coastline, the aquifer thickness in areas formed by unconsolidated sediments. To validate our final estimation results, we collected both borehole and literature data. Additionally, we performed a numerical modelling study to evaluate the effects of varying aquifer thickness and geological complexity on simulated saltwater intrusion. The results show that our aquifer thickness estimates can indeed be used for regional-scale groundwater flow modelling but that for local assessments additional geological information should be included. The final dataset has been made publicly available (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.880771).

AB  - Sensitive areas like oases are threatened by climatic variations and human activities that can catalyze desertification processes. Remote sensing the Earth surface from satellites is a good tool to monitor such types of change through several techniques. In this paper a remote sensing method that has been widely used for vegetated areas is adapted to study dry regions. The method consists of a combination of the Change Vector Analysis and the Tasselled Cap (TC) transform. To adapt it to dryland conditions a new set of parameters for the TC transform is hereby calculated for the Landsat 8 OLI system. The new TC parameters are tested in the analysis of the surface change in Azraq Oasis, Jordan, over a time span of 30 years (1984-2013) for Landsat satellites images. Azraq is considered a good testing site since in the early 1990s it has been subject to a complete drying up of the superficial springs, mainly due to over-exploitation of the groundwater basin. Results show that the chosen technique is able to detect the expected change on the surface, consistent with photo-interpretation and historical information available.

AB  - The spatial variability through time of the degree of salinity of soils and groundwater is a major issue concerning the sustainable management of water resources. The problem is accentuated in coastal plain areas where saline bodies of different origin coexist. We present an extensive geoelectrical resistivity dataset collected in the Alt Emporda clastic coastal aquifer system (NE Spain) integrating the results of field campaigns undertaken within a period of more than two decades. The dataset is unique in the literature and comprises highly valuable information for the investigation of saline domains. The joint application of Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) methods allowed the identification of saline domains and monitoring their evolution through time. Geophysical data gathered during field campaigns in 1982, 2002 and 2010 were calibrated and interpreted on the basis of soil and groundwater physico-chemical analyses and hydrogeological, stratigraphic and geomorphological data. The results illustrate the potential of electrical resistivity methods at differentiating saline domains in coastal aquifer areas and at modelling their configuration and evolution. Although the VES data processing allows solving the one-dimensional resistivity structure of the subsurface, the inversion imposes a 1D layered model, thus interpretation of two-dimensional structures is subject to the interpolation between discrete measures. In contrast, ERT data offer a continuous 2D-image of the resistivity distribution, both laterally and in depth. Given that the bulk resistivity of the medium is extremely sensitive to salt content, the ERT profiles permitted identifying and determining the geometry of hyper-saline areas (characterized by resistivities of less than 5 Omega m). The study demonstrates the efficiency of the electrical methods to map subsurface conductive zones and illustrates how the accurate knowledge of the hydrogeological pattern results critical to meet this objective.

AB  - Large-scale geological features have been identified by satellite imagery and global positioning system data in the Wajid Sandstone in Saudi Arabia. The main objective is to evaluate the importance of fractures for the overall flow behaviour in this fractured rock aquifer and to estimate in-situ hydraulic apertures. Data on fractures and lineaments were available for three outcrops. By applying a "cut-out" routine on the fracture endpoint data of these fracture trace windows, three deterministic discrete fracture networks (DFN), with an area of 100 m x 100 m, could be generated. These were used to simulate the fracture flow and to determine the hydraulic conductivity tensors. Using additional data on hydraulic pumping tests and matrix conductivities, in-situ hydraulic apertures could be determined. Average in-situ hydraulic apertures range from 1,300 to 1,700 A mu m. Observations from the field support these results. In addition, a hydraulic conductivity ratio between the matrix and fracture system was used to identify the contribution of the DFN to the overall fluid transport. A ratio of 10.4 was determined, which indicates that the effective flow behaviour in the Wajid Sandstone aquifer is not entirely dominated by the fracture system, though evidently strongly controlled by it.

AB  - The increased attention given to international transboundary aquifers may be nowhere more pressing than on the western bank of the Jordan River. Hydropolitical analysis of six decades of Israeli and Palestinian pumping records reveals how ground water abstraction rates are as asymmetrical as are water allocations. The particular hydrogeology of the region, notably the variability in depth to ground water, variations in ground water quality, and the vulnerability of the aquifer, also affect the outcome. The records confirm previously drawn conclusions of the influence of the agricultural lobby in maintaining a supply-side water management paradigm. Comparison of water consumption rates divulges that water consumed by all sectors of the farming-based Palestinian economy is less than half of Israeli domestic consumption. The overwhelming majority of "reserve" flows from wet years are sold at subsidized rates to the Israeli agricultural sector, while very minor amounts are sold at normal rates to the Palestinian side for drinking water. An apparent coevolution of water resource variability and politics serves to explain increased Israeli pumping prior to negotiations in the early 1990s. The abstraction record from the Western Aquifer Basin discloses that the effective limit set by the terms of the 1995 Oslo II Agreement is regularly violated by the Israeli side, thereby putting the aquifer at risk. The picture that emerges is one of a transboundary water regime that is much more exploitative than cooperative and that risks spoiling the resource as it poisons international relations.

AB  - Groundwater-fed irrigation has altered surface and groundwater interactions in the Republic River basin (RRB) in the midwestern United States, where agriculture heavily depends on irrigation. The decreasing flow trend recorded at the RRB gauging station since the 1950s reflects the synthetical effect of dynamic interactions between surface water and groundwater systems, which has been enhanced by groundwater pumping and irrigation return flow. This study uses a systematic modeling approach to analyze the conjunctive effects of pumping and return flow on streamflow. A watershed management model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), is modified and established for the Frenchman Creek basin (FCB), a subbasin of RRB, to examine the causes of streamflow changes. The baseflow component in SWAT is linked to aquifer storage so that the model can simulate the combined effects of groundwater pumping and irrigation return flow on natural streamflow. Results show that irrigation has not only depleted streamflow but also changed the flow pattern and seasonal variability. The changes can be decomposed into decrease in the slow component (baseflow) and increase in the fast components (surface and subsurface flow). Since the fast components are subject to higher variability than the slow component, the annual streamflow variability is amplified. Agricultural water use in this region also has changed the groundwater storage seasonal regime from the pattern of "summer recharge and winter discharge" in the past to "summer discharge and winter recharge" at present. This challenges the existing groundwater modeling, which usually assumes fixed recharge pattern and rates.

AB  - Seawater intrusion is a complex groundwater - seawater interaction process, and it is influenced by many factors from ground surface to underground, from groundwater to seawater. Generally, for seawater intrusion model, some model parameters and boundary conditions are always specified by model users' personal experiences or literature's reference value. The defective model would damage the groundwater management for controlling and preventing seawater intrusion when making decisions are based on this model. In order to improve the reliability of seawater intrusion model, the influences of model inputs on output should be identified prior at optimizing model inputs. Dagu river basin, Jiaozhou Bay is one of the most serious areas of seawater intrusion in China, and it is chosen as the study area in this study. The seawater intrusion model of Dagu river basin is built based on a general program SEAWAT4. The key influence factors of model output are analyzed by two sensitivity analysis methods, i.e., stepwise regression and mutual entropy. The results demonstrated that the most important influence factors which have largest sensitivities to groundwater Cl - concentration are the precipitation rate and groundwater pumping in agriculture area. In addition, the hydraulic conductivity of zone 1 has a non-negligible influence on seawater intrusion process. Stepwise regression analysis is capable of identifying most important influence factor, and it can't handle complicated nonlinear input-output relationship. Mutual entropy analysis is reliable for identifying the influence factors for complex seawater intrusion model.

AB  - Coastal areas have great significance for human living, economy and society development in the world. With the rapid increase of pressures from human activities and climate change, the safety of groundwater resource is under the threat of seawater intrusion in coastal areas. The area of Laizhou Bay is one of the most serious seawater intruded areas in China, since seawater intrusion phenomenon was firstly recognized in the middle of 1970s. This study assessed the pollution risk of a groundwater source filed of western Laizhou Bay area by inferring the probability distribution of groundwater Cl- concentration. The numerical model of seawater intrusion process is built by using SEAWAT4. The parameter uncertainty of this model is evaluated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, and DREAM((zs)) is used as sampling algorithm. Then, the predictive distribution of Cl- concentration at groundwater source field is inferred by using the samples of model parameters obtained from MCMC. After that, the pollution risk of groundwater source filed is assessed by the predictive quantiles of Cl- concentration. The results of model calibration and verification demonstrate that the DREAM((zs)) based MCMC is efficient and reliable to estimate model parameters under current observation. Under the condition of 95% confidence level, the groundwater source point will not be polluted by seawater intrusion in future five years (2015-2019). In addition, the 2.5% and 97.5% predictive quantiles show that the Cl- concentration of groundwater source field always vary between 175 mg/l and 200 mg/l. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a groundwater (GW) extraction scheme was incorporated into the Community Earth System Model, version 1.2.0 (CESM1.2.0), to create a new version called CESM1.2_GW, which was used to investigate hydrologic and climatic responses to anthropogenic GW extraction on a global scale. An ensemble of 41-yr simulations with and without GW extraction (estimated based on local water supply and demand) was conducted and analyzed. The results revealed that GW extraction and water consumption caused drying in deep soil layers but wetting in upper layers, along with a rapidly declining GW table in areas with the most severe GW extraction, including the central United States, the north China plain, and northern India and Pakistan. The atmosphere also responded to GW extraction, with cooling at the 850-hPa level over northern India and Pakistan and a large area in northern China and central Russia. Increased precipitation occurred in the north China plain due to increased evapotranspiration from irrigation. Decreased precipitation occurred in northern India because the Indian monsoon and its transport of water vapor were weaker as a result of cooling induced by GW use. Additionally, the background climate change may complicate the precipitation responses to the GW use. Local terrestrial water storage was shown to be unsustainable at the current high GW extraction rate. Thus, a balance between reduced GW withdrawal and rapid economic development must be achieved in order to maintain a sustainable GW resource, especially in regions where GW is being overexploited.

AB  - Increasing water scarcity places considerable importance on the quantification of water footprint (WF) at different levels. Despite progress made previously, there are still very few WF studies focusing on specific river basins, especially for those in arid and semi-arid regions. The aim of this study is to quantify WF within the Heihe River Basin (HRB), a basin located in the arid and semi-arid northwest of China. The findings show that the WF was 1768 million m(3) yr(-1) in the HRB over 2004-2006. Agricultural production was the largest water consumer, accounting for 96% of the WF (92% for crop production and 4% for livestock production). The remaining 4% was for the industrial and domestic sectors. The "blue" (surface-and groundwater) component of WF was 811 million m(3) yr(-1). This indicates a blue water proportion of 46%, which is much higher than the world average and China's average, which is mainly due to the aridness of the HRB and a high dependence on irrigation for crop production. However, even in such a river basin, blue WF was still smaller than "green" (soil water) WF, indicating the importance of green water. We find that blue WF exceeded blue water availability during eight months per year and also on an annual basis. This indicates that WF of human activities was achieved at a cost of violating environmental flows of natural freshwater ecosystems, and such a WF pattern is not sustainable. Considering the large WF of crop production, optimizing the crop planting pattern is often a key to achieving more sustainable water use in arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - It is widely accepted that Prediction Interval (PI) can provide more accurate and precise information than deterministic forecast when the uncertainty level increases in flood forecasting. Coverage probability and PI width are two main criteria used to assess the constructed PI, rarely has there been an index to quantify the symmetry between target value and PI. This study extends a newly proposed PI estimation method called Lower Upper Bound Estimation (LUBE) method, which adopts an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with two outputs to directly generate the upper and lower bounds of PI without making any assumption about the data distribution. A new Prediction Interval Symmetry (PIS) index is introduced and a new objective function is developed for the comprehensive evaluation of PI considering their coverage probability, width and symmetry. Furthermore, Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm (SCE-UA) is used to minimize the objective function and optimize ANN parameters in the LUBE method. The proposed method is applied to a real world flood forecasting case study of the upper Yangtze River Watershed. The result shows that the SCE-UA based LUBE method with new objective function is very efficient, meanwhile, the midpoint forecasting of the PI obtains excellent performance by evidently improving the symmetry of PI.

AB  - The city of Beijing has long-term concerns over the sustainable yield from its groundwater aquifers. The aquifers provide half of the city's water supply and have seen falling water tables over the past century. The sustainable yield of aquifers below urban Beijing is assessed based on changes to the groundwater budget equation from virgin conditions. Sources of anthropogenic recharge, including leakage from water mains and sewer pipes, seepage from septic tanks, irrigation, gardening, and artificial recharge, are together as large as changes to the groundwater flux as a result of groundwater withdrawals. Changes to natural recharge, and to a lesser extent natural discharge, also significantly impact the water budget. Uncertainty persists in several components of the budget equation, in particular changes to the groundwater flux. Estimates of the upper and lower bounds for sustainable yield are relatively unchanged for the years 2000, 2010, and 2015. However, the components of the budget will change as seepage from septic tanks is expected to decrease. Uncertainty in the likely range of sustainable yield is reduced by conducting Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations indicate there is a 96% chance that the lower pumping rate established in 1990 is sustainable. However, with between 30 and 60% of the water budget provided by treated or untreated wastewater, there must be long-term concerns over the quality of the groundwater supply.

AB  - Overexploitation of groundwater resources has caused groundwater-related problems all over the world. Effective groundwater governance is a favorable guarantee for its protection and sustainable utilization. Accurate prediction of groundwater level (GWL) or depth to groundwater (GWD) plays an important role in groundwater resource management. Due to the limitations and complexity of numerical models, this study aims to develop surrogate models that can dually control the GWL (or GWD) and groundwater quantity (GWQ) in each district of the Beijing Plain, China, using the methods of multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). This study used 180 monthly GWD data records, including the first 168 data records for model development (training) and the remaining 12 data records for model verification. The results indicate that the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and correlation coefficient (R) for both the MLR and BP-ANN models are high in most districts and that the MLR models are more appropriate in this study. Fifteen scenarios under different conditions of groundwater use and precipitation are designed to demonstrate the applicability of the developed model in groundwater management. The surrogate models are effective tools that can be used by decision-makers for groundwater management.

AB  - Groundwater overdraft threatens the future of irrigated agriculture in the North China Plain. Because irrigated winter wheat is the dominant user of extracted groundwater, improved understanding of water cycling through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum during wheat cultivation in the North China Plain is necessary for improving the sustainable utilization of limited water resources and promoting food security. In this paper, a combination of micrometeorological and stable isotope techniques was used to investigate evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics in a typical winter wheat agro-ecosystem (Luancheng Agro-ecosystem Experiment Station, Hebei Province). Stable isotope mixing models were used with eddy covariance evapotranspiration estimates and micro-lysimeter evaporation measurements to partition evapotranspiration and determine temporal variability of root water uptake depths. Results suggest that evaporation during the winter wheat irrigation season can reach up to 30% of the total water consumption (almost two typical irrigations). The main depths of root water uptake were 0-40 cm. Therefore, it is suggested that the planned irrigation wetting depth can be reduced at least to 40 cm, rather than the traditional 100 cm, as a means of water conservation. Widespread implementation of these practices could amount to a significant water savings for the North China Plain. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The North China Plain (NCP) is one of the places where the groundwater is most over-exploited in the world. Currently, our understanding on the spatiotemporal variability of the cones of depression in this region is fragmentary. This study intends to simulate the cones of depression in the shallow aquifer across the entire NCP during the whole period from 1960 to 2011. During the simulation, the dominant role of anthropogenic activities is emphasized and carefully taken into account using a Neural Network Algorithm. The results show that cones of depression in the NCP were formed in 1970s and continuously expanded. Their centers were getting deeper with an increasing degree of groundwater exploitation. This simulation provides valuable insights for developing more sustainable groundwater management options after the implementation of the South-to-NorthWater Diversion Project (SNWDP), which is a very important surface water project in China in the near future. The numerical model in this paper is built by MODFLOW, with pumpage data completed by neural network algorithm and hydrogeological parameters calibrated by simulated annealing algorithm. Based on our long-term numerical model for regional groundwater flow in the NCP, one exploitation limitation strategy after the implementation of SNWDP is studied in this paper. The results indicate that the SNWDP is beneficial for groundwater recovery in the NCP. A number of immense groundwater cones will gradually shrink. However, the recovery of the groundwater environment in the NCP will require a long time.

AB  - Investigating the hydraulic connectivity of a complex karst aquifer system is an important research topic for sustainable operation and optimization layout of karst groundwater exploitation and recharge. However, the identification of preferential sites of recharge and exploitation is usually subject to regional hydrogeology conditions and the mechanisms of recharge and exploitation. The conventional research methods of hydraulic connectivity often have some limitations. In this study, we developed an improved grey amplitude relation model to explore the hydraulic connectivity in Jinan spring catchment and presented a quantized evaluation index water table fluctuation relation degree (WTFRD) using karst groundwater table data in Western Jinan and Jinan spring groups from 2014 to 2017. Results showed that the total WTFRD was 0.854 between Western Jinan and Jinan spring groups when the external distraction for karst groundwater table was the smallest, which was in high relation degree grade. Meanwhile, the change rules of karst groundwater table in the two sites were basically the same. Accordingly, a high connectivity occurred between the two karst aquifers from a statistical perspective, and further illustrated thatWestern Jinan could be selected as preferential experiment sites. A comprehensive case in Jinan spring catchment indicated that the WTFRD provided a preliminary idea to investigate hydraulic connectivity quantitatively. This method could be considered as a pre-study of the conventional experiments to form a high-efficiency and low-cost combined method, which has great potential and merits further study.

AB  - Water is essential for life. Specifically in the oases of inland arid basins, water is a critically limited resource, essential for the development of the socio-economy and the sustainability of eco-environmental systems. Due to the unique hydrological regime present in arid oases, a moderate groundwater table is the goal of sustainable water management. A shallow water table induces serious secondary salinization and collapse of agriculture, while a deep water table causes deterioration of natural vegetation. From the hydrological perspective, the exchange flux between the unsaturated vadose zone and groundwater reservoir is a critical link to understanding regional water table dynamics. This flux is substantially influenced by anthropogenic activities. In the Tarim River basin of western China, where agriculture consumes over 90% of available water resources, the exchange flux between the unsaturated vadose zone and groundwater reservoir is influenced strongly by irrigation. Recently, mulched drip irrigation, a sophisticated water-saving irrigation method, was widely applied in the Tarim River basin, which greatly impacted the exchange flux and thus the regional groundwater dynamics. Capitalizing on recent progress in evaporation measurement techniques, we can now close the water balance and directly quantify the exchange flux at the field scale, thus gaining a better understanding of regional groundwater dynamics. In this study, comprehensive observations of water balance components in an irrigated cropland were implemented in 2012 and 2013 in a typical oasis within the Tarim River basin. The water balance analysis showed that the exchange flux and groundwater dynamics were significantly altered by the application of water-saving irrigation. The exchange flux at the groundwater table is mostly downward (310.5 mm year(-1)), especially during drip irrigation period and spring flush period, while the upward flux is trivial (16.1 mm year(-1)) due to the moderate groundwater table depth (annual average depth 2.9 m). Traditional secondary salinization caused by intense phreatic evaporation (fed by upward exchange flux) is alleviated. However, a new form of secondary salinization may be introduced unwittingly if there is lack of water for periodic flushing, especially when brackish water is used in the irrigation. Furthermore, the water saved via drip irrigation has been used in further growth of irrigated lands instead of supporting the ecological system. This could lead to an increased risk of eco-environmental degradation and calls for improved governance schemes. The insights gained from this study can be potentially applied to other arid inland areas (e.g., central Asia) which face similar water shortages and human development problems.

AB  - Understanding the interaction between groundwater and surface water is of vital significance for the sustainable management of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. In this study, multi environmental tracers (hydrochemical parameters, stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and radioactive Rn-222) were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers (Tiangeli River and Nomhon River) in the Nomhon area, southeast of the arid Qaidam Basin, northwest China. Here we observed that the Rn-222 concentration of waters were distinctly different with a decrease order of groundwater > spring > river in this area. Along the Tiangeli River, the Rn-222 concentrations of groundwater, springs and river water were about 12,120-17,407, 3013-15,819 and 809-8205 Bq/m(3), respectively. This river was characterized by the high Rn-222 concentration of the river water and was investigated to be mainly fed by springs and groundwater discharge. Along the Nomhon river, Rn-222 concentration of groundwater and river water was about 6772-60,369 and 14-519 Bq/m(3), respectively. An average background of the Rn-222 concentration in the upstream of the river was determined to be about 43 Bq/m(3). A high Rn-222 concentration zone along the river appeared in the midstream, with a peak value of 519 Bq/m(3) and a distance about 10 km, indicating that groundwater discharged to the Nomhon River in the alluvial plain. A Rn-222 mass-balance model was constructed to estimate the groundwater discharge into the river, showing a maximum groundwater discharge of 0.37 m(3)/s in the midstream of Nomhon River during the sampling period. The stable isotopic compositions (delta D and delta O-18) and hydrochemical characteristics (hydrochemical type, TDS and EC) showed corresponding changes along these two rivers, which also provided evidences for the groundwater-surface water interactions in the Nomhon area.

AB  - Since 1980s, seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers caused by groundwater over-abstraction has led to extensive deterioration in groundwater quality and quantity and has been fazing local residents in Zhoushuizi district of the metropolitan Dalian City in northern China. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) density-dependent numerical model was constructed to simulate the seawater intrusion process in heterogeneous coastal aquifers in Zhoushuizi district of the metropolitan Dalian City. Considering that the groundwater flow in karst aquifers in northern China is relatively uniform, approximately following Darcy's law, the fracture-karst aquifer in Zhoushuizi district of Dalian City was simplified as an equivalent porous medium. To further identify the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifers in the study area, the model was calibrated and validated using the observation heads and concentrations. Based on the current groundwater abstraction conditions of the study area, the calibrated and validated model was then applied to predict the dynamics and trend of seawater intrusion for the following 30 years from 2010 to 2040 under different rainfall scenarios. The overall extent of seawater intrusion in the future would be even more severe under different prediction scenarios. This 3D seawater intrusion model provides the theoretical basis for implementing a reasonable allocation of groundwater resource, which may significantly affect the sustainability of water resources.

AB  - This paper presents a numerical modeling study of tidal effects on groundwater dynamics of a multi-layered estuary aquifer system. In this study, to generalize the tidal loading effects on the confined aquifer, we used equivalent tidal loading boundary condition based on existing analytical solutions for the confined aquifer in a three-dimensional numerical model and then good simulated result was obtained. Using the numerical model, the tide-induced groundwater level and confined groundwater discharge dynamics were discussed and the following conclusions were obtained. The combined action of sea tide and river tide can enhance the tidal response of groundwater level in the aquifer system, especially for the confined groundwater. The river tidal effect is more significant in the areas away from coastline. Although the confined aquifer is separated by a layer of clay from the ocean, because of the tidal loading effects, the confined groundwater discharge also changes periodically displaying a negative correlation with the tide level fluctuations like the unconfined groundwater discharge. Using linear functions that express the relationship between the mean confined groundwater flux and sea tide level, the confined groundwater flux through the tidal loading boundaries can be approximately estimated. When the sea tide level is higher than 4.4 m, there would be a risk of seawater intrusion into the confined aquifer in the study area. This case study is useful for numerical studying of tidal effects on groundwater resource dynamics in a coastal multi-layered estuary aquifer system.

For agricultural and industrial activities, prediction of groundwater status is critical. As a main branch of neural network, shallow artificial neural network models have been deployed in prediction areas such as groundwater and rainfall since late 1980s. In this paper, artificial neural network (ANN) model within a newly proposed algorithm has been developed for groundwater status forecasting. Having considered previous algorithms for ANN model in time series forecast, this new Monte Carlo based algorithm demonstrated a good result. The experiments of this ANN model in predicting groundwater status were conducted on the Heihe River area dataset, which was curated on the collected data. When compared with its original physical based model, this ANN model was able to achieve a more stable and accurate result. A comparison and an analysis of this ANN model were also presented in this paper.

AB  - The principle of water balance is well known, but its application often causes controversy. One recent debate is the use of the water balance equation to determine the safe yield and sustainable yield. Two extreme opinions exist on natural groundwater recharge. One misconception is that the development of groundwater is considered to be safe if the pumping rate does not exceed the rate of natural recharge. Another is that the sustainable pumping rate has nothing to do with natural recharge, but depends on the increased recharge and decreased discharge (called capture) induced by pumping. The truth is that both the natural recharge and dynamic development of the capture determine the safe yield or sustainable yield of a groundwater basin. This paper clarifies the water budget controversy and uses the water balance equation to critically analyse the concepts of safe yield and sustainable yield. Numerical simulation of a hypothetical case was used to demonstrate the natural groundwater balance, effects of pumping and the dynamic development of the capture. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Overexploitation of groundwater resources has supported rapid social and economical developments in Beijing City in last 30 years. The newly constructed emergency well fields have saved Beijing from a critical water crisis caused by a long drought spell of eight consecutive years from 1999 to 2006. But this unsustainable development has resulted in serious consequences: discharges to rivers ceased, large number of pumping wells went dry, and land subsidence caused destruction of underground infrastructure. The completion of the middle route of South to North water transfer project to transfer water from Yangtze river to Beijing City by 2010 provides opportunity to reverse the trend of groundwater depletion and to achieve a long-term sustainable development of groundwater resources in Beijing Plain. Four options of groundwater development in Beijing Plain were formulated and assessed with a regional transient groundwater flow model. The business as usual scenario was used as a reference for the comparative analysis and indicates fast depletion of groundwater resources. The reduction of abstraction scenario has immediate and fast recovery of groundwater levels, especially at the cone of depression. The scenario of artificially enhanced groundwater recharge would replenish groundwater resources and maintain the capacity of present water supply well fields. The combined scenario of the reduction of abstraction and the increase of recharge could bring the aquifer systems into a new equilibrium state in 50 years. A hydrological sustainability of groundwater resources development could then be achieved in Beijing Plain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last decades, large-scale land use changes took place in the Hailiutu River catchment, a semi-arid area in northwest China. These changes had significant impacts on the water resources in the area. Insights into groundwater and surface water interactions and vegetation-water dependencies help to understand these impacts and formulate sustainable water resources management policies. In this study, groundwater and surface water interactions were identified using the baseflow index at the catchment scale, and hydraulic and water temperature methods as well as event hydrograph separation techniques at the sub-catchment scale. The results show that almost 90% of the river discharge consists of groundwater. Vegetation dependencies on groundwater were analysed from the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and groundwater depth at the catchment scale and along an ecohydrogeological cross-section, and by measuring the sap flow of different plants, soil water contents and groundwater levels at different research sites. The results show that all vegetation types, i.e. trees (willow (Salix matsudana) and poplar (Populus simonii), bushes (salix Salix psammophila), and agricultural crops (maize - Zea mays)), depend largely on groundwater as the source for transpiration. The comparative analysis indicates that maize crops use the largest amount of water, followed by poplar trees, salix bushes, and willow trees. For sustainable water use with the objective of satisfying the water demand for socio-economical development and to prevent desertification and ecological impacts on streams, more water-use-efficient crops such as sorghum, barley or millet should be promoted to reduce the consumptive water use. Willow trees should be used as wind-breaks in croplands and along roads, and drought-resistant and less water-use intensive plants (for instance native bushes) should be used to vegetate sand dunes.

AB  - Groundwater overexploitation is threatening our ecosystems and even the life of future generations. Once happens, elimination of the bad influence will be a long-term process. It should be a feasible approach to take the environmental recovery as a whole by the way of the groundwater management. A case study of water resources management in Huaibei city, within semiarid region of north Anhui province, China, was illustrated, especially on the issues of groundwater over-extraction drawdown funnel recovery. Taking into account the water demand for satisfying the urban development in the next 15 years, three target years of water resources planning were postulated as the present (2005), the short-term (2010) and the long-term (2020), respectively. Four hydrological years: wet year, mean year, dry year and extremely dry year, were also defined by the rainfall data for many years. A groundwater management model which could deal with twelve possible scenarios (3 target years of water resources planning x4 hydrological years) was established based on simulation and optimization. The groundwater management model could optimize the strategies of water resources development, integrate various kinds of water sources, e.g. groundwater, surface water and additive water sources, and meet the water demand for the urban development within an area of Huaibei city. Importantly, in accordance with the groundwater management model solutions, the issues of groundwater over-extraction drawdown funnel, which has formed within the Huaibei downtown area for many years and lead to some environmental and social problems, would be solved over the whole planning period.

AB  - Generally, an aquifer system coupled into a groundwater management model was regarded as a linear system. However, in terms of systems analysis, the aquifer system can be proven to be an incremental linear system rather than a linear system. For example, a confined aquifer system can be decomposed into two parts, one of which is a linear time invariability sub-system and another is a zero-input response. This system does not meet the additivity property of linear system, but satisfies the incremental linear system characteristics. In order to better understand, a case study of water resources management of Huaibei city within semiarid region, north Anhui province of China, is cited. Taking into account the water demand for satisfying the urban development in the next 15 years, three planning target years of water resources are preset as the present (2005), the short term (2010) and the long term (2020), respectively, and four hydrological years (e.g., wet year, mean year, dry year, and extremely dry year) are also defined by the rainfall data of many years. A groundwater management model based on linear programming is established. This model can deal with 12 possible scenarios (3 target years x 4 hydrological years), optimize the strategies of water resources development, integrate various kinds of water sources (e.g., groundwater, surface-water and additional water) and meet the water demand for the urban development of Huaibei city. In accordance with the groundwater management model solutions, the problem of groundwater drawdown funnels (groundwater overextraction funnels) which formed within the Huaibei downtown area for many years and led to some environmental and social issues will be solved over the whole planning period. More importantly, through statistically analyzing the model solutions, the relationships between the groundwater pumping (input signals) and groundwater level recovery (output signals) show up the characteristics of the incremental linear system.

AB  - Aquitards are an important part of an aquifer system. Hydraulic properties of an aquitard, such as hydraulic conductivity and specific storage must be determined before the investigation of strata deformation and groundwater depletion. Based on the proposed one-dimensional schematic diagram of an aquifer system, a dimensionless analytical solution for flow in the aquitard is derived under the boundary condition of drawdown in adjacent aquifers showing a linear increase with time. The dissipation process of time-lag drawdown in the aquitard is analyzed. The type curve of cumulative aquitard compaction versus time is derived based on the mass balance equation of water. A new type curve method is further derived for estimating the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of the aquitard. The type curve method reflects the time-lag drainage within the aquitard. This method is tested by a field application to the Shanghai aquifer system to obtain the hydraulic parameters of the second aquitard at the f(10-7) extensometer site. Field test results show that the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage are 4.26x10(-10) m/s and 2.22x10(-4) m(-1), respectively. For an aquifer system with long-term observed water level and deformation data, the new type curve method can be used to some extent.

AB  - We present a simple approach to assess stream depletion by groundwater pumping in aquifers with leakage from an underlying source bed. The hydrogeological setting consists of a leaky aquifer that is hydraulically connected to a stream of shallow penetration. Under such conditions, the pumping rate is partially supported by the depletion of an adjacent stream. We quantify this phenomenon by deriving explicit analytical solutions that elucidate the interplay among the streambed, aquifer, aquitard, and well parameters. In particular, our solutions demonstrate how both hydraulic stream-aquifer connection and hydrostratigraphic conditions determine the possible fraction of the pumping rate supplied by the stream depletion. In leaky aquifers, this fraction decreases exponentially with the distance between a stream and a pumping well and is attenuated by a factor that depends on the streambed, aquifer, and aquitard parameters. The balance of pumping rate is supplied from recharge zone of the source bed.

AB  - A case study is presented to (1) assess the water footprint of New Zealand (NZ) dairy farming in two contrasting regions of Waikato (North Island, non-irrigated moderate rainfall) and Canterbury (South Island, irrigated low rainfall), (2) illustrate differences in water footprint methods and (3) evaluate the suitability of indicators derived from each water footprint method. The water footprint methods (1) water footprint following the Water Footprint Network (WF-(WFN)), (2) stress-weighted water footprint (WF-(Ridoutt)), following Ridoutt and Pfister (2010) and Ridoutt et al. (2010), (3) environmental impacts of freshwater consumption expressed in damage to resources (Delta R), damage to ecosystem quality (Delta EQ), and damage to human health (Delta HH) following Pfister et al. (2009), and (4) freshwater ecosystem impacts (FEIs) and freshwater depletion (FD) following Mila i Canals et al. (2009, 2010) were applied to two average dairy systems in the different regions. Total WF-(WFN) was 945 and 1084 L H2O/kg fat-and-protein-corrected milk (FPCM) for the average Waikato and Canterbury dairy farm systems, respectively. The Waikato farm system had a higher green WF-(WFN),whereas the Canterbury farm system had the highest blue WF-(WFN) impact, grey WF-(WFN), WF-(Ridoutt), Delta EQ FEI, and FD mostly due to groundwater and surface water used for irrigation of pasture. For both dairy farm systems, Delta R and Delta HH were zero. Data collection in the inventory showed similarities between the water footprint methods. The methods, however, all resulted in different total estimates due to (1) the inclusion of how land conversion from native vegetation to agriculture affects freshwater availability in FEI, (2) application of different characterisation factors, and (3) inclusion of a normalisation procedure for WF-(Ridoutt). For example, WFc-(Ridoutt) was 0.011 L H2O-equivalents (eq)/kg FPCM for Waikato and 7.1 L H2O-eq/kg FPCM for Canterbury dairy farm systems whereas corresponding values for FEI were -1.8 L ecosystem-eq H2O/kg FPCM and 14.6 L ecosystem-eq H2O/kg FPCM respectively. Use of catchment-specific characterisation factors are preferred over characterisation factors based on globally-spatial data for WF studies. For FD, we recommend incorporating the concept of sustainable yield for aquifers into the characterisation factor. Summing the different coloured waters into one WF-(WFN) reduces the relevance and indicators related to regional water scarcity have more meaning for end-users compared to volumetric estimates. The blue WF-(WFN) impact, WF-(Ridoutt), and FEI are all useful indicators but only relate to freshwater availability. In respect to dairy farming, these indicators should be complemented by FD and Delta R and other impact categories which assess water degradation impacts on ecosystems and human health while avoiding double-counting: e.g., Delta EQ Delta HH, and grey WF-(WFN) impact or eutrophication potential (EP).

AB  - In this study, we incorporated a groundwater exploitation scheme into the land surface model CLM3.5 to investigate the effects of the anthropogenic exploitation of groundwater on land surface processes in a river basin. Simulations of the Haihe River Basin in northern China were conducted for the years 1965-.2000 using the model. A control Simulation without exploitation and three exploitation simulations with different water demands derived from socioeconomic data related to the Basin were conducted. The results showed that groundwater exploitation for human activities resulted in increased wetting and cooling effects at the land surface and reduced groundwater storage. A lowering of the groundwater table, increased upper soil moisture, reduced 2 m air temperature, and enhanced latent heat flux were detected by the end of the simulated period, and the changes at the land surface were related linearly to the water demands. To determine the possible responses of the land surface processes in extreme cases (i.e., in which the exploitation process either continued or ceased), additional hypothetical simulations for the coming 200 years with constant climate forcing were conducted, regardless of changes in climate. The simulations revealed that the local groundwater storage on the plains could not contend with high-intensity exploitation for long if the exploitation process continues at the current rate. Changes attributable to groundwater exploitation reached extreme values and then weakened within decades with the depletion of groundwater resources and the exploitation process will therefore cease. However, if exploitation is stopped completely to allow groundwater to recover, drying and warming effects, such as increased temperature, reduced soil moisture, and reduced total runoff, would occur in the Basin within the early decades of the simulation period. The effects of exploitation will then gradually disappear, and the variables will approach the natural state and stabilize at different rates. Simulations were also conducted for cases in which exploitation either continues or ceases using future climate scenario outputs from a general circulation model. The resulting trends were almost the same as those of the simulations with constant climate forcing, despite differences in the climate data input. Therefore, a balance between slow groundwater restoration and rapid human development of the land must be achieved to maintain a sustainable water resource. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The sustainable management of groundwater resources is a pressing necessity for most countries. As most of the Arab world is facing severe water scarcity, threats of depletion of non-renewable groundwater, and problems of pollution and salt-water intrusions into groundwater aquifers, much effort should be devoted to eliminate these dangers in advance. This work was devoted to bring up insights into Arab world research activities in groundwater, which is a crucial task to identify their status and can help in shaping up and improving future research activities. A bibliometric analysis has been conducted to track these activities. The study identified 1417 documents which represent 3.3% of global research productivity. Egypt was the most productive country (313; 22.1%), followed by Saudi Arabia (254; 17.9%). Total citations were 9720 with an average of 6.9. The h-index of the retrieved documents was 39, and the highest one was 22 for Egypt. The most common subject category was Environmental Science, and the most productive journal was Arabian Journal of Geosciences (99; 7.0%). In international research collaboration, France was the most collaborated country with Arab world (125; 8.8%), followed by the United States (113; 8.0%). The most productive institution was King Abdul-Aziz University, Saudi Arabia (66; 4.7%). The outcomes shows remarkable improvements in groundwater research activities originated from the Arab world. Even though, constructive efforts should be pursued vigorously to bridge the gaps in groundwater-based research. Moreover, promotion of better evaluation tools to assess the risks arising from the mismanagement of groundwater resources is required urgently.
