Abbas et al.,2014,Desalination and Water Treatment,"spatio temporal analysis of groundwater regime within rawalpindi municipal jurisdiction, pakistan","the study investigates the spatial and temporal variation of groundwatertable within municipal precincts of rawalpindi metropolitan city. the research was based on current and historic withdrawals as a primary source of drinking water supply. a geodatabase of 278 tube wells with three distinct timelines of recorded subsurfacewater levels was developed. vertical sections were extracted from the interpolated surfaces and reconciled to a common x, y reference to isolate spatial and temporal trend of watertable. overexploitation of groundwater is leading to progressive depletion of the groundwater resource. the decline in groundwater level was observed to be steep in areas farthest from the potential recharge zones, a phenomenon that is also coincident with the density of the installed wells. gradual cessation of pumpage within the metropolitan area and artificial means of replenishing the groundwater aquifer are recommended."
Abd Rahman et al.,2018,Transport in Porous Media,laboratory investigation of lnapl migration in double porosity soil under fractured condition using digital image analysis,"the issue of leakage and spillage of light non aqueous phase liquid (lnapl) contribute to groundwater contamination, resulting in groundwater pollution and rendering the quality of groundwater unsafe for drinking and agriculture. therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate lnapl migration in the double porosity soil under vibration effect, which has become important for sustainability of groundwater utilization and a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of liquid migration into the groundwater. a laboratory experiment was conducted to observe the phenomena and characteristics of soil structure, and the pattern of liquid migration in deformable double porosity by using digital image processing technique. the experiments show that the simulated results were reasonably concise with the visual observations. the gradual increase in vibration table excitation frequency yielded different vibration responses from the respective soils. this indicated that the soil surface acceleration depended significantly on the soil conditions, soil water content, soil structure, and the pattern of soil crack. faster migration occurred at the cracked soil surface condition compared to other locations on the soil surface that were not cracked. comparison between soils with 25% and 30% moisture content showed that the downward migration of lnapl is faster when the soil moisture content is higher. this occurs in soil with higher moisture content due to greater capillary pressure exerted by the liquids and the inter aggregate pores. this study proved that the digital image processing technique is capable to provide detailed migration flow information to facilitate the researchers to better understand contaminate migration patterns and to ensure sustainability of groundwater resources."
Abd Rahman et al.,2018,Geologia Croatica,vibration effect influence upon non aqueous phase liquid migration in double porosity soil,"natural disasters such as earthquakes, el nino, tsunamis and water pollution have a negative impact on human health and living environment. some of these may give rise to subsurface vibrations that can potentially increase groundwater pollution risks in double porosity systems. the more complicated situation was where underground storage tanks and petroleum pipeline damage have caused the leakage of non aqueous phase liquids (napls) which migrated into the groundwater resources. these problems need to be addressed by both professionals and researchers worldwide to ensure the sustainability of groundwater utilization. this paper aims to investigate and understand napl migration in vibrated double porosity soils. to do so it was necessary to study the phenomena and characteristic of soil structure and the pattern of napl migration to identify cost effective remediation schemes. a laboratory experiment was conducted to study the phenomena and characteristics of vibration response and napl migration in double porosity soil deformation under vibration effect using a digital image processing technique (dipt). the outcomes of the experiment show that the gradual increase of vibration table excitation frequency yielded different vibration responses from the respective soils. this indicated that soil surface acceleration depended significantly on the soil conditions, soil water content, soil structure and the pattern of soil fracturing. napl migration was faster in sample 2 with 150ml toluene than sample 1 with 70ml toluene and this could be because the greater amount of toluene in sample 2 exerted an extra entry force on top of the soil sample that had yet to migrate through the sample surface. finally, it was concluded that the dipt may provide detailed information, and can be used to understand and identify the remediation method as well as to ensure the sustainable consumption of groundwater."
Abd-Elhamid et al.,2011,Water Resources Management,a cost effective method to control seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"intrusion of seawater into coastal aquifers is considered one of the most important processes that degrade water quality by raising the salinity to levels exceeding acceptable drinking standards. therefore saltwater intrusion should be prevented or at least controlled to protect groundwater resources. this paper presents a cost effective method to control seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. this methodology adr (abstraction, desalination and recharge) includes; abstraction of saline water and recharge to the aquifer after desalination. a coupled transient density dependent finite element model is developed for simulation of fluid flow and solute transport and used to simulate seawater intrusion. the simulation model has been integrated with an optimization model to examine three scenarios to control seawater intrusion including; abstraction, recharge and a combination system, adr. the main objectives of the models are to determine the optimal depths, locations and abstraction/recharge rates for the wells to minimize the total costs for construction and operation as well as salt concentrations in the aquifer. a comparison between the combined system (adr) and the individual abstraction or recharge system is made in terms of total cost and total salt concentration in the aquifer and the amount of repulsion of seawater achieved. the results show that the proposed adr system performs significantly better than using abstraction or recharge wells alone as it gives the least cost and least salt concentration in the aquifer. adr is considered an effective tool to control seawater intrusion and can be applied in areas where there is a risk of seawater intrusion."
Abiye et al.,2014,South African Journal of Geology,groundwater as a viable resource under climate change in the nile basin:a rapid hydro geological assessment,"the storage of groundwater in the nile basin has been assessed in order to inform its potential role in community development and sustainable growth in the basin, where hydropolitics is critical among upstream and downstream countries. it is a well known fact that water management activities in the basin focus on the surfacewater resources, with less or no attention to the groundwater, while the majority of urban and rural communities rely on groundwater for day to day activities. the results show that downstream countries (egypt and sudan) have considerable groundwater storage as a result of favourable geological formations (sedimentary rocks), while upstream countries (ethiopia, eritrea, kenya, uganda, tanzania, democratic republic of the congo (drc), burundi and rwanda) are underlain by crystalline basement and volcanic rocks with low groundwater productivity. the available groundwater in the shallow and deep (transboundary) aquifers requires holistic development and management by stakeholders across the borders in order to sustainably adapt to changing climate in the basin and shift the dependence pattern on the nile river for water supply."
Abliz et al.,2016,Environmental Earth Sciences,"effects of shallow groundwatertable and salinity on soil salt dynamics in the keriya oasis, northwestern china","in this paper, the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater depth and groundwater salinity associated with agricultural activities and land cover and landuse (lclu) in the keriya oasis, xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china, was investigated. a decision tree classification was developed for lclu mapping by using landsat 8 imagery. radial basis function, pearson's correlation coefficient, moran's i statistics and geographically weighted regression were employed to identify the spatial and temporal relationship between topsoil salinity and lclu types. the results showed that groundwater depth in about 75 % of the study area was less than 3.0 m. groundwater salinity showed an increasing trend with decreasing groundwater depth. a relatively higher positive correlation (r = 0.87) was found between groundwater salinity and topsoil salinity. topsoil salinity was exacerbated by agricultural activities at the upstream of seasonal rivers, causing severe soil salinization and soil degradation in the downstream. both groundwater depth and soil salinity showed seasonal fluctuations with the shallowest groundwater level occurring in spring, while during summer and autumn, groundwater depth increased due to the extensive of agricultural water consumption and the regional evapotranspiration, which was followed by a winter recharge; non saline groundwater region was 21 % of the research area in spring, which dropped to 1.1, 1.0 and 1.2 %, respectively, during the summer, autumn and winter. the results also demonstrated that shallow groundwater depth of 2.5 m is the critical depth value for soil salinization in the keriya oasis."
Abo et al.,2015,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,"comparative estimation of the potential groundwater recharge in al zerba catchment of aleppo basin, syria","since groundwater is an integral component of natural hydrologic systems, an estimation of groundwater recharge is required to understand the changes in the temporal waterbudget and groundwater flow system. the rate of groundwater recharge varies widely in space and time particularly in arid to semiarid regions, and it is rather difficult to measure recharge directly. the aim of this study was to assess the natural groundwater recharge in al zerba catchment and the interaction between the surface and groundwater. the catchment is classified as an arid to semiarid climate with an aridity index of 0.25 to 0.3 and long term average annual precipitation ranging from 300 to 350 mm. delineation of the catchment boundary was carried out using spatial interpolation of elevation data extracted from the digital elevation model. the effects of vegetation and abstraction from pumping wells on the groundwatertable were investigated. furthermore, groundwater recharge was estimated based on waterbudget, watertable fluctuation analysis by using rainfall infiltration breakthrough, and soil waterbalance using hydrologic evaluation of landfill performance model (help3). the results show that groundwater pumping leads negative impact to long term decrease in groundwater levels, particularly in the dry season, while no significant effects of vegetation on groundwater were observed. moreover, the result showed an average annual groundwater recharge ranging from 20 to 35 mm/a (about 10 to 15 % of the precipitation period 2001 2010), concentrated in the north and southwestern regions (outcrops of permeable/coarse grained limestone and a major fault zone)."
Abo et al.,2015,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,"investigation of the potential surface groundwater relationship using automated base flow separation techniques and recession curve analysis in al zerba region of aleppo, syria","the management of water resources requires an adequate understanding of the relationship between the various components of the hydrological cycle. the accelerated urbanization and agricultural development impose the concern about the sustainability of water resources, particularly in arid and semi arid regions. in such environments, water scarcity and drought often lead to intensive groundwater abstraction which can adversely affect the hydrological system. severe overexploitation of groundwater has been observed on the aleppo basin of the al qweek river. the al qweek valley constitutes the central part of the study area (southwestern parts of the aleppo basin). the region is characterized by a semi arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 325 mm. the intensive exploitation of the upper aquifer in the catchment is responsible for a continuous decline of the piezometric levels with an average of 1.8 m/year. the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the upper aquifer and the al qweek river within the catchment boundary using streamflow and hydrograph separation techniques by means of daily discharge data for both the al qweek and al qwaak rivers. hydrooffice was used for the base flow separation, flow duration curves (fdc), and recession curve displacement analysis. furthermore, groundwater recharge was estimated by means of recess and rora. this is the first study using the hydrograph separation method in this region to our knowledge. the results indicate a proportional relationship between the surface and groundwater with an average discharge fluctuation that ranged from 0.30 to 0.20 m for the al qweek and al qwaak rivers, respectively. the results also revealed a dominant base flow in the catchment that ranged from 86.3 to 88.2 % of the total flow with a computed base flow index that varied from 0.85 to 0.90 in all gauge stations, indicating a stable flow regime in the region. furthermore, the high base flow is resulting in high permeability conditions of the upper aquifer and low direct surface runoff. the visual interpretation of the fdc suggests sustained base flow from groundwater storage. the low flow index indicates an average contribution of groundwater storage of 45 to 58 %. the result of recession curve analysis shows a recession constant from 0.8 to 0.9 indicating a dominant interflow and low overland runoff. furthermore, the results also show that estimation of groundwater recharge using rora is inappropriate for the region of interest."
Abolpour et al.,2018,Agricultural Water Management,"realistic evaluation of crop water productivity for sustainable farming of wheat in kamin region, fars province, iran","currently, the economic wheat production faces severe challenges due to an increasing number of droughts. in an effort to enhance yields, most arid and semi arid areas increase the water volume used for irrigation and cultivation of wheat, resulting in an intensified pressure on water resource systems. therefore, it has become increasingly important to determine the required water volume per unit area in relation to expected wheat performance. however, such an estimation of relevant performance factors has been difficult due to unpredictable water supply capacities and the lack of reliable estimates for the demand of water. the potential crop water productivity (pcwp) defined in this study was comparing with its actual value has which obtained from field measurements based on a new approach of risk quantification. using this comparison of water use, the management coefficient was estimated, and the production reliability of wheat was calculated. based on these factors, farms that had competently adapted their management in line with climate change and water availability were selected. the results reveal that only 26 of a total of 666 wheat farms which evaluated for this case study have had reliable crop water productivity and could thus be used as models for other farms. the results showed 100% increasing in cwp with a 27% reducing in hydro module on these farms, in which case more than 34% will be reduced the groundwater withdrawal. therefore, the sustainability of groundwater resources would be better, whereas the benefit cost ratio of the whole region and the superior farms has no significant difference. the amount of water that these farms use and the resulting yield can be a suitable reference to determine the expected yield and required water volume per unit area.

Abou Zakhem et al.,2017,Hydrological Sciences Journal-Journal Des Sciences Hydrologiques,"using principal component analysis in the investigation of groundwater hydrochemistry of upper jezireh basin, syria","principal component analysis (pca) was applied to hydrochemical and isotopic data of 34 groundwater samples. this allowed the reduction of 20 variables to four significant pcs that explain 81.9% of the total variance; f1 (47.1%) explains the groundwater mineralization, whereas f2 (17%) shows isotopic enrichment and nitrate pollution. based on an iso factor scores map of f1, three water zones were delineated: zone a (f1 <   1), with fresh groundwater from the unconfined aquifer; zone b (1 > f1 >   1), with moderate mineralization from the confined unconfined aquifer boundary; and zone c (f1 > 1), with the most mineralized hot water from the confined aquifer. the iso factor scores map of f2 delineates positive values representing samples from the unconfined aquifer, with freshwater and nitrate contamination associated with stable isotope enrichment, whereas negative values represent samples from the confined aquifer. the results clearly demonstrate the usefulness of pca in groundwater hydrochemistry investigations."
Abou Zakhem et al.,2016,Environmental Earth Sciences,"cumulative drought effect on figeh karstic spring discharge (damascus basin, syria)","the effects of climate changes are being strongly perceived in the studied area as in the rest of the mediterranean basin, and groundwater resources are obviously affected. in this paper, figeh karst spring discharge and precipitation in damascus basin were analyzed by normalized methods on a yearly time scale. trends and fluctuations have been highlighted by moving average and the time series are transformed by the rescaled adjusted partial sum (raps). cumulative drought analyses were carried out using spi30 and sqi30. finally, the decreasing trends of the spring discharge due the decrease in rainfall were analyzed. the main results reveal that moving averages and linear trends of spi and sqi delineate very well the drought periods and exhibit clear decrease of precipitation and spring discharge. the raps method identifies a consecutive drought that lasted for 8 9 years separated by 2 3 years of wet periods, during the last three decades. the cumulative droughts using spi30 and sqi30 reveal that wet period (1970 1983) with positive spi30 and sqi30 was characterized by high precipitation and spring discharge, followed by transition period (1984 1997) with around zero values, was affected by the beginning of successive severe and extended droughts. finally, dry period (1998 2013) with negative indexes values distinguished by the effect of severe and extended droughts. the decreasing trends analysis using dpi and dqi showed annual decreasing rates of  0.36 % and of  0.63 %, respectively. thus, the results reveal that precipitation will be decreased to about dpi =  27 % and the discharge decline of about  47 % by 2050. consequently, figeh karstic system is affected by severe extended hydrological droughts during the past three decades especially where the spi30 and sqi30 values decrease below  10. accordingly, it requires the development of sustainable groundwater management to reduce long  terms drought risks."
Abou Zakhem et al.,2016,Journal of Earth System Science,"investigation of hydrological drought using cumulative standardized precipitation index (spi 30) in the eastern mediterranean region (damascus, syria)","the eastern mediterranean region has been exposed to drought episodes, which have been occurring more frequently during the last decades. the objective of the present paper is to study the precipitation regime of the damascus (mazzeh) meteoric station by analysing drought characteristics using the standardized precipitation index (spi) and comparing this with the drought in cyprus. the cumulative drought conceptis proposed to characterize long term hydrologic drought, which affects the shallow groundwater productivity in terms of quantity and quality. gamma probability distribution was fitted to the long term annual precipitation in damascus from 1918 1919 to 2007 2008 (n = 90 years). generally, a decreasing trend of 17% to the mean annual rainfall of damascus and 13% to the mean annual rainfall of cyprus was estimated between 1970 and 2000. the spi identifies three major extended drought periods: (1) 9 years of severe drought (1954 1963) with an average 20% precipitation deficit per year compared to the mean. (2) 8 years of severe drought (1983 1991) with a 27% deficit per year on average. (3) 9 years of extreme drought (1993 2002) with a 31% deficit per year on average. the cumulative standardized precipitation index (spi 30) demonstrates positive values for the first period and is indicative of having no effect on the global waterbalance. spi 30 exhibits sensitive equilibrium with near zero values / a near zero value (+/  1.5) for the second period. for the third period, however, the spi 30 decreases below  10 indicating an extreme hydrological drought that has negative consequences on the recent groundwater recharge. it is required to develop and implement a sustainable groundwater management strategy to reduce long terms drought risks. generally, the spi 30 in cyprus is parallel to that in damascus with a 3 5 year delay. thus, the central zone of the eastern mediterranean region is facing big challenges and has been suffering from three decades of moderate to severe hydrological drought (spi 30= 5 to  10) causing a severe decrease in springs discharges of the region. therefore, in order to reduce the climate change effects on water resources, it is necessary to adopt a sustainable proactive management plan during the frequent severe droughts."
Abuzaid et al.,2018,Egyptian Journal of Soil Science,soil quality indicators in al qalyubia governorate as affected by long term wastewater irrigation,"the sustainable irrigated agriculture in egypt is threatened by water stress that made the reuse of wastewater an alternative option not only in the sandy desert soils but also in the alluvial soils. to assess the impacts of long term wastewater irrigation on soil quality, soils have been irrigated with the effluents of al qalyubia drain beside adjacent nile fresh water irrigated soils (reference), sampled and analyzed. the wastewater irrigation improved fertility status, causing significant increases (p < 0.05) in total n and ab dtpa extractable p, fe and mn compared to the reference soils. however, there was a significant (p < 0.05) build up in soil salinity and total heavy metals; cd, cr, co, cu, ni, pb and zn in the wastewater irrigated soils over the reference soils. the dutch model indicated that the nile fresh water remained safe for agricultural production, while the wastewater irrigated soils could be used under certain precautions. focal measures are recommended to alleviate heavy metal contaminants to avoid potential environmental risks including mixing the wastewater with the fresh water before use and implementation of proper on farm treatments."
Adamowski et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,a wavelet neural network conjunction model for groundwater level forecasting,"accurate and reliable groundwater level forecasting models can help ensure the sustainable use of a watershed's aquifers for urban and rural water supply. in this paper, a new method based on coupling discrete wavelet transforms (wa) and artificial neural networks (ann) for groundwater level forecasting applications is proposed. the relative performance of the proposed coupled wavelet neural network models (wa ann) was compared to regular artificial neural network (ann) models and autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models for monthly groundwater level forecasting. the variables used to develop and validate the models were monthly total precipitation, average temperature and average groundwater level data recorded from november 2002 to october 2009 at two sites in the chateauguay watershed in quebec, canada. the wa ann models were found to provide more accurate monthly average groundwater level forecasts compared to the ann and arima models. the results of the study indicate the potential of wa ann models in forecasting groundwater levels. it is recommended that additional studies explore this proposed method, which can be used in turn to facilitate the development and implementation of more effective and sustainable groundwater management strategies.

Adhikari et al.,2017,Journal of Contemporary Water Research & Education,calibration and validation of csm cropgro cotton model using lysimeter data in the texas high plains,"texas high plains (thp), one of the most important food and fiber producing regions in the ogallala aquifer region, currently faces rapid decline of groundwater levels. predicted climate extremes and high temporal variability in growing season precipitation may require growers to pump more groundwater from the ogallala aquifer to meet higher crop water demand. the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (dssat) cropping system model (csm) is a widely used crop simulation tool for evaluating impacts of different water and crop management practices, including irrigation on crop yield and water use efficiency. in this study, cropgro cotton module of the dssat was calibrated and validated using 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2010 irrigated lysimeter field data managed by the usda ars (united states department of agriculture   agricultural research service) conservation and production research laboratory at bushland, tx. the lysimeter field consisted of four equal plots designated as ne, se, nw, and sw. crop growth characteristics including leaf area index (lai), above ground biomass (agb), evapotranspiration (et), soil moisture, and lint yield of 2000 ne, 2000 se, and 2001 ne, were used for calibration and 2002 ne, 2010 ne, and 2010 se were used for validation. the calibrated and validated model was used to simulate the long term (1924 2012) crop yield and seasonal crop et. during the calibration process, some of the cultivar and ecotype parameters that influence lai, agb, and lint yield were adjusted for better statistical results. measured and simulated lai, agb, et, soil moisture, and lint yield showed good agreement during calibration and validation as indicated by performance statistics such as r(2) from 0.70 to 0.82, and percent error (pe) =  0.85 to 17.3% for lai; r(2) = 0.89 to 0.95, and pe =  7.36 to  13.66% for agb; and r(2)=0.90 to 0.94, and pe = 3.20 to 3.44% for et during calibration and validation, respectively. the model underestimated et during peak vegetative growth and development stage except in some circumstances. the calibrated and validated model was able to simulate lint yield and seasonal et during a long term (1924 2012) historic period for bushland, tx, under irrigated conditions. the calibrated model could be used to schedule et based irrigation management practices in the thp and to estimate future et for other modeling experiments."
Adhikary et al.,2015,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,"electrical resistivity tomography for assessment of groundwater salinity in west delhi, india","indiscriminate use of agro chemicals for intensive agriculture is mainly responsible for deterioration of groundwater quality in west delhi of india. geophysical and hydrochemical investigations were carried out to decipher subsurface geologic formation and assess groundwater salinity. electrical resistivity tomography surveys revealed the presence of potential groundwater zones at 20 30 m below ground level. the groundwater quality was moderate to poor as evidenced from the low resistivity value of the potential aquifer. only 20.2 % of the study area showed good quality groundwater potentiality, situated at few pockets in eastern, western, and northern parts of the study area. low resistivity formation at southern part of the study area was due to infiltration of highly polluted drain water along with fertilizer rich surfacewater to the aquifer. hydrochemical investigation also confirmed the result. the average electrical conductivity of groundwater was around 5,950 mu s cm( 1). longitudinal unit conductance and transverse unit resistance values were calculated and used for delineation of saline groundwater zones. a direct relationship between longitudinal unit conductance and groundwater salinity made it possible to develop empirical equations by which salinity can be predicted from computed longitudinal unit conductance value. it helps for periodic monitoring of the pollution level by spending less labour and money and benefits immensely the policy makers. the article suggests further study and research work that can lead to sustainable exploitation/use and management of groundwater resources in west delhi."
Adhikary et al.,2015,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,gis applicability to assess spatio temporal variation of groundwater quality and sustainable use for irrigation,"sustainable and safe use of groundwater requires periodical monitoring of its quality. because of the presence of multiple contaminants, spatial variation of overall groundwater quality is difficult to describe. the present study describes the overall groundwater quality for irrigation using a multi criteria quality assessment system and sustainability of water use by incorporating the aspect of temporal variation of groundwater quality. the gis based multi criteria system effectively amalgamated different quality parameters into an easily understandable format and assessed the spatial variation of groundwater quality for irrigation in west delhi, india. the rate of spatial increment of poor quality groundwater within the study period was 3.7 km(2) per year. it has been observed that there is deterioration of groundwater quality from southwest to east, along the general groundwater flowdirection, and improvement of groundwater quality from west to northeast, due to less urbanization and availability of groundwater recharge zones with good quality water. temporal variation of groundwater quality is high (v>20 %) at northern part, moderate (v=10 20 %) at middle and southern parts, and less (v<10 %) at some pockets of southern part of the study area. the overall groundwater quality coupled with its variation reveals that while the groundwater use is mostly unsustainable in the southern part, groundwater sustainability is constrained by relatively poor and variable quality in western and northern fringes of the study area."
Adiat et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,assessing the accuracy of gis based elementary multi criteria decision analysis as a spatial prediction tool   a case of predicting potential zones of sustainable groundwater resources,"inappropriate handling/integration of data from various sources is a problem that can make any spatial prediction tasking and inaccurate. attempt was made in this study to offer solution to this problem by exploring the capability of gis based elementary mcda as a spatial prediction tool. in order to achieve the set objectives, spatial prediction of potential zones of sustainable groundwater resources in a given study area was used as a case study. a total of five set of criteria/factors believed to be influencing groundwater storage potential in the area were selected. each criterion/factor was assigned appropriate weight based on saaty's 9 point scale and the weights were normalized through the analytic hierarchy process (ahp). the process was integrated in the gis environment to produce the groundwater potential prediction map for the area. the effect of coherence of criteria on the efficiency of mcda as a prediction tool was also examined. the prediction map produced was found to be 81.25% accurate. the results of the examination of the effect of coherence of criteria revealed that the ability of the method to produce accurate prediction is dependent on the exhaustiveness of the set of criteria used. it was established in the study that the gis based elementary mcda technique is capable of producing accurate and reliable prediction particularly if the set of criteria use for the prediction is coherent.

Aeschbach-Hertig et al.,2012,Nature Geoscience,regional strategies for the accelerating global problem of groundwater depletion,"groundwater the world's largest freshwater resource is critically important for irrigated agriculture and hence for global food security. yet depletion is widespread in large groundwater systems in both semi arid and humid regions of the world. excessive extraction for irrigation where groundwater is slowly renewed is the main cause of the depletion, and climate change has the potential to exacerbate the problem in some regions. globally aggregated groundwater depletion contributes to sea level rise, and has accelerated markedly since the mid twentieth century. but its impacts on water resources are more obvious at the regional scale, for example in agriculturally important parts of india, china and the united states. food production in such regions can only be made sustainable in the long term if groundwater levels are stabilized. to this end, a transformation is required in how we value, manage and characterize groundwater systems. technical approaches such as water diversion, artificial groundwater recharge and efficient irrigation have failed to balance regional groundwaterbudgets. they need to be complemented by more comprehensive strategies that are adapted to the specific social, economic, political and environmental settings of each region."
Afonso et al.,2016,Water,"environmental groundwater vulnerability assessment in urban water mines (porto, nw portugal)","a multidisciplinary approach was developed to estimate urban groundwater vulnerability to contamination combining hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry, subterranean hydrogeotechnics, groundwater ecotoxicology and isotope tracers. paranhos and salgueiros spring waters in porto city were used as a case study. historical and current vulnerability scenarios were compared using hydrogeological gis based modelling. potential contamination sources were mapped around the spring galleries. most of these were point sources and their potential contamination load was moderate. the ecotoxicological assessment indicated a low acute toxicity potential. groundwater radionuclides appeared to be mainly controlled by geological factors and biomineralisation. vulnerability maps suggest that most of the area has a moderate to low vulnerability to contamination. however, some surface sources such as sewage systems cause contamination and contribute to increased vulnerability. this integrated approach was demonstrated to be adequate for a better knowledge of urban hydrogeological processes and their dynamics, and highlighted the importance of a vulnerability assessment in urban areas."
Afrifa et al.,2017,Journal of African Earth Sciences,"estimation of groundwater recharge in sedimentary rock aquifer systems in the oti basin of gushiegu district, northern ghana","sustainable development and the management of groundwater resources for optimal socio economic development constitutes one of the most effective strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change in rural areas where poverty is a critical cause of environmental damage. this research assessed groundwater recharge and its spatial and temporal variations in gushiegu district in the northern region of ghana, where groundwater is the main source of water supply for most uses. isotopic data of precipitation and groundwater were used to infer the origin of groundwater and the possible relationship between groundwater and surfacewater in the partially metamorphosed sedimentary aquifer system in the study area. though the data do not significantly establish strong relation between groundwater and surfacewater, the study suggests that groundwater in the area is of meteoric origin. however, the data also indicate significant enrichment of the heavy isotopes (o 18 and h 2) in groundwater relative to rainwater in the area. the chloride mass balance (cmb) and watertable fluctuations (wtf) techniques were used to quantitatively estimate the groundwater recharge in the area. the results suggest groundwater recharge in a range of 13.9 mm/y   218 mm/y, with an average of 89 mm/yr, representing about 1.4% 21.8% (average 8.9%) of the annual precipitation in the area. there is no clearly defined trend in the temporal variations of groundwater recharge in the area, but the spatial variations are discussed in relation to the underlying lithologies. the results suggest that the fraction of precipitation that reaches the saturated zone as groundwater recharge is largely controlled by the vertical hydraulic conductivities of the material of the unsaturated zone. the vertical hydraulic conductivity coupled with humidity variations in the area modulates the vertical infiltration and percolation of precipitation.

Ahmed et al.,2011,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,"hydrochemical evolution and variation of groundwater and its environmental impact at sohag, egypt","groundwater resources of sohag, egypt are currently threatened by contamination from agricultural and urbanization activities. groundwater in sohag area has a special significance where it is the second source for fresh water used for agricultural, domestic, and industrial purposes. due to growing population, agriculture expansion, and urbanization, groundwater quality assessment needs more attention to cope with the increasing water demand in this arid zones and limited water resources. the aim of this paper is to address the integrated role of geochemical processes, agriculture and urbanization in evolution of groundwater composition, and their impact on groundwater quality to help in management and protection of groundwater resources of study area using geochemical modeling techniques and geographical information systems. spatial variation of groundwater hydrochemical properties, rock water interaction, ion exchange, and assessment of groundwater quality were investigated. results indicated that groundwater properties are varied spatially and its evolution in the study area is generally controlled by the prevailed geochemical processes represented by leaching, dissolution, and precipitation of salts and minerals, ion exchange, in addition to human activities represented by agriculture and urbanization as well as climatic and poor drainage conditions. management alternatives should be followed in the study area to avoid degradation of groundwater quality and provide sustainable development."
Ahmed et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,"hydrologic analysis of the challenges facing water resources and sustainable development of wadi feiran basin, southern sinai, egypt","wadi feiran basin is one of the most promising areas in southern sinai (egypt) for establishing new communities and for growth in agriculture, tourism, and industry. the present challenges against development include water runoff hazards (flash flooding), the increasing water demand, and water scarcity and contamination. these challenges could be mitigated by efficient use of runoff and rainwater through appropriate management, thereby promoting sustainable development. strategies include the mitigation of runoff hazards and promoting the natural and artificial recharge of aquifers. this study uses a watershed modeling system, geographic information system, and classification scheme to predict the effects of various mitigation options on the basin's water resources. rainwater harvesting techniques could save more than 77% of the basin's runoff (by volume), which could be used for storage and aquifer recharge. a guide map is provided that shows possible locations for the proposed mitigation options in the study basin. appropriate measures should be undertaken urgently: mitigation of groundwater contamination (including effective sewage effluent management); regular monitoring of the municipal, industrial and agricultural processes that release contaminants; rationalization and regulation of the application of agro chemicals to farmland; and regular monitoring of contaminants in groundwater. stringent regulations should be implemented to prevent wastewater disposal to the aquifers in the study area."
Ahmed et al.,2016,Science of the Total Environment,"groundwater flow and geochemical evolution in the central flinders ranges, south australia","the chemical characteristics of water in the oratunga area, central flinders ranges, south australia have been used to evaluate and determine the processes controlling water chemistry in addition to the sources of ions. the isotopic analysis results show that the groundwater is mainly meteoric. based on the rock and water chemistry, ionic ratios, hydrochemical facies and saturation indices, the chemical evolution has been studied. the chemistry of groundwater revealed two types of water. thus, in high topographic areas, low tds, bicarbonate and mixed water types are dominated and support a rapid and direct recharge. while in the low topographic areas, high tds and chloride compositions are the most common attributed to the accumulation of ions and groundwater evolution. analysis of the ion concentration, head data and saturation indices shows a compositional trend that can be studied as an evolutionary system. the ionic ratios and hydrogeochemical modelling using netpath was used to quantify and verify the different hydrochemical processes. the resulting data shows that calcite dissolution/precipitation and cation exchange reactions are the major processes affecting groundwater chemical evolution of the groundwater in the basin. this study has provided a basis for a better understanding of the hydrogeologic setting in areas of a little data.

Ahn et al.,2018,Agricultural Water Management,"hydrologic impacts of drought adaptive agricultural water management in a semi arid river basin: case of rincon valley, new mexico","this paper examines the coupled effects of weather condition, crop coverage change, and regional water management (i.e., releases from caballo reservoir) on hydrologic characteristics of rincon valley (2466 km(2)), a semi arid agricultural area in new mexico, u.s.a., using soil and water assessment tool (swat). the model simulates the vertical waterbudget and horizontal water transfers during the period 1994 2013, incorporating irrigation of fourteen crops in normal (2008) and dry (2011) years to evaluate the hydrologic impacts of cropping change as a drought adaptive water management strategy. it was calibrated (2000 2002) and validated (2003 2005) using daily observed streamflow data. furthermore, evapotranspiration, diversion and irrigation water volume were verified for the period of 2000 2005 using monthly crop irrigation requirement data and canal discharge data. results demonstrate the significant role of surfacewater infiltration, providing approximately 18% of the average annual groundwater recharge during the irrigation season. watershed scale evapotranspiration (et) and return flows for the irrigation season were estimated to be 23% and 1% higher than those for the non irrigation season, respectively. for irrigation units, the ratio of et to combined precipitation and irrigation water for the dry year was 5% higher than the normal year whereas surface runoff, soil water storage, and groundwater recharge were 7%, 17%, and 39% lower than the normal year, respectively. high groundwater recharge occurs in the hydrologic response units (hru) where corn and cotton are planted on silty clay loam soil. the alfalfa acreage (i.e., the largest water user) was reduced by 15% while the cotton acreage was increased by 13% in order to adapt to lower water availability during the dry year. quantitative understanding of the hydrologic fluxes in the rincon valley's irrigated agricultural area illuminates adaptive land and water management to buffer the adverse impacts of prolonged droughts."

Ahring et al.,2012,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,groundwater surfacewater interactions and the role of phreatophytes in identifying recharge zones,"groundwater and surfacewater interactions within riparian corridors impact the distribution of phreatophytes that tap into groundwater stores. the changes in canopy area of phreatophytes over time is related to changes in depth to groundwater, distance from a stream or river, and hydrologic soil group. remote sensing was used to determine the location of trees with pre development and post development aerial photography over the ogallala aquifer in the central plains of the united states. it was found that once the depth to groundwater becomes greater than about 3 m, tree populations decrease as depth to water increases. this subsequently limited the extent of phreatophytes to within 700 m of the river. it was also found that phreatophytes have a higher likelihood of growing on hydrologic soil groups with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. phreatophytes exist along portions of the arkansas river corridor where significant decreases in groundwater occurred as long as alluvium exists to create perched conditions where trees survive dry periods. significant decreases (more that 50%) in canopy cover exists along river segments where groundwater declined by more than 10 m, indicating areas with good hydraulic connectivity between surfacewater and groundwater. thus, interpretation of changes in phreatophyte distribution using historical and recent aerial photography is important in delineating zones of enhanced recharge where aquifers might be effectively recharged through diversion of surfacewater runoff."
Aigler et al.,2013,Environmental Earth Sciences,"evaluation of groundwater withdrawal from a mountain watershed, colorado, usa","the purpose of this study is to evaluate the groundwater withdrawal potential of the fraser river watershed, a mountainous drainage system in north central colorado. laboratory tests, field investigations, and numerical modeling are conducted to present a quantitative understanding of the watershed's groundwater flow system. aquifer hydraulic conductivity values obtained from aquifer tests range from 1e 5 to 1e 3 m/s. groundwater withdrawal is concentrated in channel fill deposits of the troublesome formation within the fraser basin. a steady state groundwater flow model of the fraser river watershed is developed and calibrated using 24 observation wells in the fraser river valley and estimated baseflow of the fraser river. modeling results suggest that surface recharge is the major source of groundwater in the watershed. groundwater exits the watershed through evapotranspiration and discharge to rivers. transient groundwater flow modeling evaluates future withdrawal scenarios using the hydraulic head distribution from the steady state model as the initialcondition. drawdown within troublesome formation aquifers from the current pumping schedule approaches 2 m. when the daily pumping rate is doubled, drawdown approaches 4 m. the radius of influence is hundreds of meters to 1 km. pumping wells withdraw approximately 2 and 15 % of groundwater flowing through the well field for hydraulic conductivity of 1e 3 and 1e 5 m/s, respectively. this study suggests that the groundwater system at the fraser valley could sustain current and future withdrawals, given that the current recharge condition is maintained."
Aistrup et al.,2017,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"conserving the ogallala aquifer in southwestern kansas: from the wells to people, a holistic coupled natural human model","the impact of water policy on conserving the ogallala aquifer in groundwater management district 3 (gmd3) in southwestern kansas is analyzed using a system level theoretical approach integrating agricultural water and landuse patterns, changing climate, economic trends, and population dynamics. in so doing, we (1) model the current hyper extractive coupled natural human (cnh) system, (2) forecast outcomes of policy scenarios transitioning the current groundwater based economic system toward more sustainable paths for the social, economic, and natural components of the integrated system, and (3) develop public policy options for enhanced conservation while minimizing the economic costs for the region's communities. the findings corroborate previous studies showing that conservation often leads initially to an expansion of irrigation activities. however, we also find that the expanded presence of irrigated acreage reduces the impact of an increasingly drier climate on the region's economy and creates greater long term stability in the farming sector along with increased employment and population in the region. on the negative side, conservation lowers the net present value of farmers' current investments and there is not a policy scenario that achieves a truly sustainable solution as defined by peter h. gleick. this study reinforces the salience of interdisciplinary linked cnh models to provide policy prescriptions to untangle and address significant environmental policy issues."
Akanbi et al.,2018,Applied Water Science,"hydrogeological characterisation and prospect of basement aquifers of ibarapa region, southwestern nigeria","the present study involved the use of 82 geo electric soundings, and the measurement of well inventory and conduct of yield tests in 19 wells across the various bedrock terrains of ibarapa region of southwestern nigeria. the aim is to proffer solution to the unsustainable yield of the available boreholes in order to effectively exploit the existing groundwater resource in the area. from the geological reports, the area is underlain by four principal crystalline rocks that include porphyritic granite, gneisses, amphibolite and migmatite. the geo electric studies revealed that the degree and extent of development of the weathered fractured component varied, leading to diversity in groundwater yield and in aquifer vulnerability to contamination. the thickness of the weathered layer is greater than 18 m in areas underlain by amphibolite and gneisses and less than 13 m within migmatite and porphyritic granite terrains. high groundwater yield greater than 70 m(3)/day was recorded in wells within the zones of rock contacts and in areas with large concentration of bedrock fractures and elevated locations across the various bedrock terrains. aquifer vulnerability is low in amphibolite, high in granitic terrains, low to moderate in gneisses and high to moderate in migmatite. also, wells' depths and terrain elevation have a moderate to strong indirect relationship with groundwater yield in most bedrock terrains, except in high topographic areas underlain by porphyritic granite. therefore, there is need for modification of well depth in accordance with the terrain elevation and hydrogeological complexity of the weathered fractured components of the variuos bedrock terrains, so as to ensure a sustainable groundwater yield."
Akinwumiju et al.,2018,Sustainable Water Resources Management,a gis based aquifer vulnerability assessment in the basement complex terrain of southwestern nigeria,"aquifer contamination risk is a major challenge confronting the sustainability of groundwater resources in the basement environment of sub saharan africa. this study adopted a gis based fuzzy logic model to assess the vulnerability of basement aquifers across a basin in southwestern nigeria. hydro environmental setting of the studied basin was represented by twelve parameters, viz: pro aquifer medium, watertable depth, drainage density, lineament density, topsoil, aquifer depth, aquifer hc, lithology, landuse, vegetation index, slope and aquifer luc. sensitivity analyses were undertaken to determine the significance and individual contributions of the model parameters to aquifer vulnerability. in addition, the study demonstrated scientific methods of constructing independent model parameters. the studied basin is characterized by patches of very high aquifer vulnerability in the west owing to low protective capacity and high anthropogenic imprints. the eastern part is dominated by moderate aquifer vulnerability, while the elevated central part portrays low aquifer vulnerability due to low anthropogenic imprints. highest aquifer vulnerability is attributed to slope, while vegetation index, aquifer luc and pro aquifer medium also pose high impact on aquifer vulnerability. vulnerability index is highly sensitive to the combined removal of pro aquifer medium and watertable depth, while the least sensitivity is attributed to the removal of lineament density layer. pro aquifer medium, watertable depth, drainage density, lineament density, topsoil, aquifer depth and aquifer hc constitute a set of parameters that can explain aquifer vulnerability in the basement environment. however, pro aquifer medium and watertable depth are the most important environmental variables that determine aquifer vulnerability across the study area. the adoption of geophysical techniques has provided scientific means of constructing the model parameters. the employed gis procedure paved way for a more objective intrinsic aquifer vulnerability analysis."

Ala-Aho et al.,2015,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,estimation of temporal and spatial variations in groundwater recharge in unconfined sand aquifers using scots pine inventories,"climate change and landuse are rapidly changing the amount and temporal distribution of recharge in northern aquifers. this paper presents a novel method for distributing monte carlo simulations of 1 d sandy sediment profile spatially to estimate transient recharge in an unconfined esker aquifer. the modelling approach uses data based estimates for the most important parameters controlling the total amount (canopy cover) and timing (thickness of the unsaturated zone) of groundwater recharge. scots pine canopy was parameterized to leaf area index (lai) using forestry inventory data. uncertainty in the parameters controlling sediment hydraulic properties and evapotranspiration (et) was carried over from the monte carlo runs to the final recharge estimates. different mechanisms for lake, soil, and snow evaporation and transpiration were used in the model set up. finally, the model output was validated with independent recharge estimates using the watertable fluctuation (wtf) method and baseflow estimation. the results indicated that lai is important in controlling total recharge amount. soil evaporation (se) compensated for transpiration for areas with low lai values, which may be significant in optimal management of forestry and recharge. different forest management scenarios tested with the model showed differences in annual recharge of up to 100 mm. the uncertainty in recharge estimates arising from the simulation parameters was lower than the interannual variation caused by climate conditions. it proved important to take unsaturated thickness and vegetation cover into account when estimating spatially and temporally distributed recharge in sandy unconfined aquifers."
Alabjah et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,assessment of saltwater contamination extent in the coastal aquifers of chaouia (morocco) using the electric recognition,"the coastal chaouia, located on the moroccan atlantic coast, comports three aquifers: a first plio quaternary constitutes the cover, a second cretaceous located at sw in the zone of azemmour tnine chtouka, and a third primary located at se in the zone of tnine chtouka casablanca. these reservoirs constitute the only exploitable water resource for the social and economic development of the region between azemmour and casablanca. these aquifers are unconfined, pellicular, and discontinuous. they feed by infiltration of rainwater and discharge at sea. agricultural irrigation is carried out exclusively from the groundwater, which causes a drop of the piezometric surface and the intrusion of saltwater into the aquifer at the coast. the consequence is the abandonment of some wells contaminated by seawater leading to conflict situations and significant economic losses. therefore, delineation of the freshwater/saltwater interface is very important in order to build a sustainable groundwater management system and to implement appropriate regulatory policies. the purpose of this study is to determine the extent and the geometric characteristics of the saltwater contamination extent in the coastal aquifers of the coastal chaouia. to achieve this, 399 vertical electric soundings and 48 electrical resistivity tomography profiles were performed perpendicular to the ocean. furthermore, the electrical conductivity and the piezometry were measured in 344 wells distributed over the study area. the study demonstrated the effectiveness of electrical methods for mapping seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. in fact, the results of the interpretation of the ves and erts after calibration with the lithological data of the boreholes, as well as the values of the electrical conductivity, have shown that the length of the saltwater wedge penetration inland depends on the lithological nature of the aquifer formations. thus, in the zone of azemmour   tnine chtouka, characterized by the presence of cretaceous terrains, the extension of the saltwater wedge exceeds 2 km towards the continent and its depth reaches 45 m. on the other hand, in the zone of tnine chtouka  casablanca, characterized by the rise of the schists surmounted by the altered schists the seawater intrusion remains limited at 700 m from the coast and at 20 m of depth."
Alaghmand et al.,2013,Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences,impacts of groundwater extraction on salinization risk in a semi arid floodplain,"in the lower river murray in australia, a combination of a reduction in the frequency, duration and magnitude of natural floods, rising saline watertables in floodplains, and excessive evapotranspiration have led to an irrigation induced groundwater mound forcing the naturally saline groundwater onto the floodplain. it is during the attenuation phase of floods that these large salt accumulations are likely to be mobilised and discharged into the river. this has been highlighted as the most significant risk in the murray darling basin and the south australian government and catchment management authorities have subsequently developed salt interception schemes (sis). the aim of these schemes is to reduce the hydraulic gradient that drives the regional saline groundwater towards the river murray. this paper investigates the interactions between a river (river murray in south australia) and a saline semi arid floodplain (clark's floodplain) that is significantly influenced by groundwater lowering due to a particular sis. the results confirm that groundwater extraction maintains a lower watertable and a higher amount of fresh river water flux to the saline floodplain aquifer. in terms of salinity, this may lead to less solute stored in the floodplain aquifer. this occurs through three mechanisms, namely extraction of the solute mass from the system, reducing the saline groundwater flux from the highland to the floodplain and changing the floodplain groundwater regime from a losing to a gaining one. it is shown that groundwater extraction is able to remove some of the solute stored in the unsaturated zone and this can mitigate the floodplain salinity risk. a conceptual model of the impact of groundwater extraction on floodplain salinization has been developed."
Alaghmand et al.,2014,Environmental Modelling & Software,modelling the impacts of river stage manipulation on a complex river floodplain system in a semi arid region,"this paper investigates the complex interaction between a river and a saline floodplain in a semi arid environment strongly influenced by groundwater lowering using a fully integrated physically based numerical model. the main objective is to quantify the impacts of river stage manipulation on freshening of the shallow floodplain groundwater through bank storage. it is shown that river stage rises produce a relatively less saline floodplain aquifer with a larger freshwater lens. first, an increase in river stage reduces saline groundwater recharge to the floodplain. second, the enhanced bank storage is able to freshen the groundwater near the river banks during high flow pulses by mixing fresh water with saline groundwater. overall, it was found that river stage manipulation may be considered as a short term salt management technique. however, if longer term strategies are required, it may be possible to implement these salt interception measures periodically.

Alam et al.,2014,Agricultural Water Management,punjab scavenger wells for sustainable additional groundwater irrigation,"we aim to solve the longstanding problem of sustainable groundwater extraction in the pakistani punjab (indus basin). since public scavenging wells were abandoned in the 1990s, farmers have largely embraced the practice of skimming wells to prevent or reduce salinity in their abstracted water. although this may be an effective short term solution, salinity levels will continue to rise overtime, rendering groundwater unsuitable for irrigation. we investigate the creation of balanced scavenging wells to reduce salinization so that sustainable groundwater use is possible as an additional source for irrigation. to achieve such sustainability, a certain amount of brackish water must be discharged, and this amount is determined by assessing the combined salt and waterbudgets. matlab based seawat models were used to show that (1) recirculation wells can substantially delay (but not prevent) salinization as a mid term solution and (2) scavenging is the only long term option to solve the salinization problem. final (i.e., long term) salinity does not depend on hydraulic parameters or initial groundwater salinity, which can only delay or speed up the process of salinization. a sensitivityanalysis showed that vertical anisotropy (ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity) is the most important hydraulic variable for reducing the depth reached by streamlines, which reduces the time required to reach the equilibrium salinity. we conclude: (1) the extraction of freshwater can be determined from leakage, return flow and saltwater extraction; (2) the required saltwater extraction does not depend on freshwater extraction, although for recirculation, saltwater extraction does depend on saltwater injection; and (3) the final salinity in the saturated zone only depends on the salinity of the irrigation water, saltwater extraction, leakage from the irrigation canal system and, in the case of recirculation, the saltwater injection.

Alam et al.,2014,Hydrological Processes,sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater for additional irrigation,"the key to sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater for additional irrigation' is the salt balance of groundwater below an irrigated field. this paper aims to develop a mathematical tool to study the accumulation of salt in the groundwater below an irrigated field as caused by irrigation recirculation. this study derives a salt balance of groundwater to ensure that the additional irrigation from groundwater remains possible in the future. the water and salt budgets by themselves do neither provide information concerning farmers' options nor on the limits of the individual terms in the budget equations. it is presumed that farmers will intuitively aim for (1) an optimal value of the actual evapotranspiration, and (2) a return flow as a feasible low fraction of the available water. we, therefore, derive the irrigation from groundwater q as a consequence of the predefined farmers' aims to achieve a high actual evapotranspiration in combination with a given optimally used irrigation system. our model concludes that the required amount of drainage is only dependent on the ratio of the salinity in the surface irrigation water and the acceptable salinity of the groundwater. the final salinity in the saturated zone only depends on salt carrying inflows and outflows. from the aforesaid model, it is further concluded that sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater for additional irrigation requires long term salt management, which should be founded on the essential controlling factors as derived in this paper. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Alamdarlo et al.,2019,Agricultural Water Management,"improving demand technology and internalizing external effects in groundwater market framework, case study: qazvin plain in iran","water supply and demand policies have associated with different implications for sustainable groundwater management. these policies are adopted aimed to improve the welfare of the water beneficiaries. accordingly, this study has analyzed the effects of improvement on the irrigation systems efficiency and the internalization of external effects of groundwater extraction in a dynamic market framework in qazvin plain. for this purpose, firstly water supply and demand functions are estimated, and the effects of applying two different scenarios have been evaluated using the dynamic programming model. the spatial lag model has been used to estimate the groundwater extraction function and internalization of external effects of groundwater extraction. according to the results, improvement of irrigation systems has a more effective role in improving aquifer status. also, applying internalization scenario on the 50 year horizon will reduce the present value of the welfare of the exploiters by 33%, while improving irrigation system will increase their welfare level by 143%. also, this policy can reduce the rate of watertable reduction in the aquifer. accordingly, it is recommended that supportive policies be developed by the government to improve the efficiency of irrigation systems."

Alcala et al.,2015,Science of the Total Environment,"a hydrological economic model for sustainable groundwater use in sparse data drylands: application to the amtoudi oasis in southern morocco, northern sahara","a hydrological economic model is introduced to describe the dynamics of groundwater dependent economics (agriculture and tourism) for sustainable use in sparse data drylands. the amtoudi oasis, a remote area in southern morocco, in the northern sahara attractive for tourism and with evidence of groundwater degradation, was chosen to show the model operation. governing system variables were identified and put into action through system dynamics (sd) modeling causal diagrams to program basic formulations into a model having two modules coupled by the nexus 'pumping': (1) the hydrological module represents the net groundwaterbalance (g) dynamics; and (2) the economic module reproduces the variation in the consumers of water, both the population and tourists. the model was operated under similar influx of tourists and different scenarios of water availability, such as the wet 2009 2010 and the average 2010 2011 hydrological years. the rise in international tourism is identified as the main driving force reducing emigration and introducing new social habits in the population, in particular concerning water consumption. urban water allotment (p u) was doubled for less than a 100 inhabitant net increase in recent decades. the water allocation for agriculture (p i), the largest consumer of water, had remained constant for decades. despite that the 2 year monitoring period is not long enough to draw long term conclusions, groundwater imbalance was reflected by net aquifer recharge (r) less than p i + pu (g < 0) in the average year 2010 2011, with net lateral inflow from adjacent cambrian formations being the largest recharge component. r is expected to be much less than p i + p u in recurrent dry spells. some low technology actions are tentatively proposed to mitigate groundwater degradation, such as: wastewater capture, treatment, and reuse for irrigation; storm water harvesting for irrigation; and active maintenance of the irrigation system to improve its efficiency.

Alfaro et al.,2017,Hydrogeology Journal,modelling groundwater over extraction in the southern jordan valley with scarce data,"to deal with the challenge of groundwater over extraction in arid and semi arid environments, it is necessary to establish management strategies based on the knowledge of hydrogeological conditions, which can be difficult in places where hydrogeological data are dispersed, scarce or present potential misinformation. groundwater levels in the southern jordan valley (jordan) have decreased drastically in the last three decades, caused by over extraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes. this study presents a local, two dimensional and transient numerical groundwater model, using modflow, to characterise the groundwater system and the waterbalance in the southern jordan valley. furthermore, scenarios are simulated regarding hydrological conditions and management options, like extension of arable land and closure of illegal wells, influencing the projection of groundwater extraction. a limited dataset, literature values, field surveys, and the 'crop water requirement method' are combined to determine boundarycondition, aquifer parameters, and sources and sinks. the model results show good agreement between predicted and observed values; groundwater level contours agree with the conceptual model and expected flowdirection, and, in terms of waterbalance, flow volumes are in accordance with literature values. average annual water consumption for irrigation is estimated to be 29 million m(3) and simulation results show that a reduction of groundwater pumping by 40% could recover groundwater heads, reducing the water taken from storage. this study presents an example of how to develop a local numerical groundwater model to support management strategies under the condition of data scarcity."
Alfarrah et al.,2017,Groundwater,"sinkholes due to groundwater withdrawal in tazerbo wellfield, se libya","the desert of eastern libya forms one of the most arid regions of the sahara. the great man made river project (gmrp) was established. it transports millions of cubic meters of water a day from desert wellfields to the coastal cities, where over 80% of the population lives. the tazerbo wellfield is one of the wellfields designed within the gmrp, delivering water to the eastern coast of libya through an underground pipe network. tazerbo wellfield consists of 108 production wells; each well was designed to pump 100 l/s. the planned total groundwater withdrawal from all wells is 1 million m(3)/d. the deep sandstone aquifer (nubian sandstone) is covered by a thick mudstone siltstone aquitard and is being heavily pumped. the aquifer and fine grained sediments of the aquitard may be compacted resulting in land subsidence as a result of high exploitation. local sinkholes have developed in the area of tazerbo since the start of the pumping from the wellfield in 2004. these sinkholes have been caused mainly by lowering of the piezometric heads due to the withdrawal of groundwater. in this study, a hydrogeological investigation is presented about the effect of large groundwater pumping from the nubian sandstone aquifer in tazerbo wellfield, se libya, based on physical parameters for 108 production wells and 23 observation wells."
Ali et al.,2012,Water Resources Management,sustainability of groundwater resources in the north eastern region of bangladesh,"water is essential for economic, social, and environmental development. global water resources are vulnerable due to increasing demand related to population growth, pollution potential, and climate change. competition for water between different sectors is increasing. to meet the increasing demand, the use of groundwater is increasing worldwide. in this paper, the watertable dynamics of the north eastern region of bangladesh were studied using the mekesens software. this study reveals that the depth to watertable (wt) of almost all the wells is declining slowly. in many cases, the depth will approximately double by the year 2040, and almost all will double by 2060, if the present trend continues. if the decline of the watertable is allowed to continue in the long run, the result could be a serious threat to the ecology and to the sustainability of food production, which is vital for the nation's food security. therefore, necessary measures should be taken to sustain water resources and thereby agricultural production. demand side management of water and the development of alternative surfacewater sources seem to be viable strategies for the area. these strategies could be employed to reduce pressure on groundwater and thus maintain the sustainability of the resource."
Alimonti et al.,2015,Water Resources Management,reliability analysis for preliminary forecasts of hydrogeological unit productivity,"the aim of this work is to find a probabilistic characterization of the productive capacity of a well in a geological formation hosting an aquifer. such characterization in terms of productive capacity may allow a preliminary assessment to be made of the probability of success for a required productivity (i.e. target point). this evaluation is usually carried out by statistical analysis of a geological dataset, which is likely to be influenced by many parameters. such datasets are often incomplete or unreliable. therefore, a method for evaluating potential productivity, using probabilistic hydraulic conductivity data, is proposed. the hydraulic characterization of hydrogeologic units is based on the collection of information obtained mainly through pumping tests and their interpretation. the results, expressed in terms of hydraulic conductivity, are summarized in a range of variability that is strictly dependent on the number of performed tests and their spatial distribution in the unit itself. if this range is known, an estimate of well's yield can be made on a deterministic basis, through thiem's relationship for steady state conditions, by setting a value of hydraulic conductivity that corresponds to the average value of the range. the proposed reliability analysis enables to overcome the limitations of the deterministic approach by correlating each calculated flow rate, which is taken to be a design flow rate exceeding the critical flow rate of the hydrogeologic unit, to its probability of failure. therefore, this approach aims to evaluate the probability of failure of the water system. the preliminary result is to associate the values of aquifer exploitation with a probability failure function. this outcome can then be used to define the potential solutions in the optimal allocation of the withdrawal by means of reliability analysis that takes into account the uncertainty of the system."

Allan et al.,2013,Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability,climate change and water security: challenges for adaptive water management,"water security is a key policy area for the anthropocene; here we consider recent discourses of adaptivemanagement in relation to water security. definitions of water security emphasise the dual productive/destructive potentials of water, indicating its inherent economic, social and environmental complexity. adaptivemanagement has potential to address this social ecological complexity because it supports a holistic approach. although adaptivemanagement is sometimes reduced to little more than conventional action under a new name, the potential for integrative, holistic, learning centred approaches remains within the concept of adaptation, and in the complementary conceptualisations of integrated water resources management, social learning and resilience thinking. linking across policy fields (the water food energy nexus) can only be achieved by these types of adaptive flexible and reflective approaches, and there is some, albeit tentative, moves in this direction in china's national water policy, the european flood directive and australia's murray darling basin plan. there is, however, much to do before water security, under an adaptive paradigm, becomes a concept and institutionalised practice that is continuously re viewed and reconstructed to meet the needs of an ever changing world."

Arnoux et al.,2017,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,impacts of changes in groundwater recharge on the isotopic composition and geochemistry of seasonally ice covered lakes: insights for sustainable management,"lakes are under increasing pressure due to widespread anthropogenic impacts related to rapid development and population growth. accordingly, many lakes are currently undergoing a systematic decline in water quality. recent studies have highlighted that global warming and the subsequent changes in water use may further exacerbate eutrophication in lakes. lake evolution depends strongly on hydrologic balance, and therefore on groundwater connectivity. groundwater also influences the sensitivity of lacustrine ecosystems to climate and environmental changes, and governs their resilience. improved characterization of groundwater exchange with lakes is needed today for lake preservation, lake restoration, and sustainable management of lake water quality into the future. in this context, the aim of the present paper is to determine if the future evolution of the climate, the population, and the recharge could modify the geochemistry of lakes (mainly isotopic signature and quality via phosphorous load) and if the isotopic monitoring of lakes could be an efficient tool to highlight the variability of the waterbudget and quality. ' small groundwater connected lakes were chosen to simulate changes in waterbalance and water quality expected under future climate change scenarios, namely representative concentration pathways (rcps) 4.5 and 8.5. contemporary baseline conditions, including isotope mass balance and geochemical characteristics, were determined through an intensive field based research program prior to the simulations. results highlight that future lake geochemistry and isotopic composition trends will depend on four main parameters: lo cation (and therefore climate conditions), lake catchment size (which impacts the intensity of the flux change), lake volume (which impacts the range of variation), and lake g index (i.e., the percentage of groundwater that makes up total lake inflows), the latter being the dominant control on waterbalance conditions, as revealed by the sensitivity of lake isotopic composition. based on these model simulations, stable isotopes appear to be especially useful for detecting changes in recharge to lakes with a g index of between 50 and 80 %, but response is non linear. simulated monthly trends reveal that evolution of annual lake isotopic composition can be dampened by opposing monthly recharge fluctuations. it is also shown that changes in water quality in groundwater connected lakes depend significantly on lake location and on the intensity of recharge change."

Baiocchi et al.,2014,Environmental Earth Sciences,comparison of pumping at constant head and at a constant rate for determining the sustainable yield of a well,"determining the yield of a production well remains one of the main problems in hydrogeological studies. starting from the results of a 3 year long monitoring of a continuously exploited well functioning at constant head (i.e., at a variable discharge rate), a new pumping style has been examined using numerical models. the objective is to control the impact of pumping on the aquifer in accordance with the principle of sustainability. different models were developed in a transient state and were calibrated using discharge data of the well during the recession periods. successively, the trends of the residual outflow from the aquifer system with the well operating at variable discharge and at constant discharge were simulated. the results indicate that the ratio of the volume of water pumped from the well to the volume of residual outflow is a significant indicator of the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals. modeling confirms that a constant discharge rate can be derived from the information gained through a preliminary production phase of a well at constant head. this approach appears to be particularly useful when the problem is determining the sustainable yield of a single well from aquifers with low hydraulic diffusivity."

Bhanja et al.,2019,Advances in Water Resources,in situ and satellite based estimates of usable groundwater storage across india: implications for drinking water supply and food security,"groundwater use in india has been in the limelight in recent years due to its intensive and apparent unsustainable use that poses threats to water security, drinking water supply and food production. here, we present estimates of usable groundwater storage, for the first time, at the state level across all of india using both in situ and satellite based measurements. groundwater level data are used from 3907 in situ monitoring wells across india and the total usable groundwater storage (ugws) is estimated between 2005 and 2013. the ugws estimates indicates high rates of depletion (> 5 km(3)/yr) of groundwater storage (gws) in north east india (i.e. assam), even though increase in precipitation has been observed in that state. satellite based (gravity recovery and climate experiment, grace) estimates indicate that the development of recent gws depletion zones is concentrated in unconsolidated sediments or lithotype across the indus, ganges and brahmaputra basins, in the states of punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, bihar, and west bengal. in contrast, southern and central indian states (such as andhra pradesh, maharashtra, gujarat, tamil nadu, and chattisgarh), show replenishing gws trends. we also find that the states with highest groundwater depletion rates are subjected to water intensive cropping practices during the study period. we temporally downscale the ugws with support from grace satellite based measurements. we conclude that the approach we developed here can be applied in other parts of the world to devise management options for sustainable groundwater use."
Bhanja et al.,2019,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,long term groundwater recharge rates across india by in situ measurements,"groundwater recharge sustains groundwater discharge, including natural discharge through springs and the base flow to surfacewater as well as anthropogenic discharge through pumping wells. here, for the first time, we compute long term (1996 2015) groundwater recharge rates using data retrieved from several groundwater level monitoring locations across india (3.3 million km(2) area), the most groundwater stressed region globally. spatial variations in groundwater recharge rates (basin wide mean: 17 to 960 mm yr( 1)) were estimated in the 22 major river basins across india. the extensive plains of the indus ganges brahmaputra (igb) river basins are subjected to prevalence of comparatively higher recharge. this is mainly attributed to occurrence of coarse sediments, higher rainfall, and intensive irrigation linked groundwater abstraction inducing recharge by increasing available groundwater storage and return flows. lower recharge rates (< 200 mm yr( 1)) in most of the central and southern study areas occur in cratonic, crystalline fractured aquifers. estimated recharge rates have been compared favorably with field scale recharge estimates (n = 52) based on tracer (tritium) injection tests. results show that precipitation rates do not significantly influence groundwater recharge in most of the river basins across india, indicating human influence in prevailing recharge rates. the spatial variability in recharge rates could provide critical input for policymakers to develop more sustainable groundwater management in india."
Bhanja et al.,2018,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"estimating long term groundwater storage and its controlling factors in alberta, canada","groundwater is one of the most important natural resources for economic development and environmental sustainability. in this study, we estimated groundwater storage in 11 major river basins across alberta, canada, using a combination of remote sensing (gravity recovery and climate experiment, grace), in situ surfacewater data, and land surface modeling estimates (gwsa(sat)). we applied separate calculations for unconfined and confined aquifers, for the first time, to represent their hydrogeological differences. storage coefficients for the individual wells were incorporated to compute the monthly in situ groundwater storage (gwsa(obs)). the gwsa(sat) values from the two satellite based products were compared with gwsa(obs) estimates. the estimates of gwsa(sat) were in good agreement with the gwsaobs in terms of pattern and magnitude (e.g., rmse ranged from 2 to 14 cm). while comparing gwsasat with gwsa(obs), most of the statistical analyses provide mixed responses; however the hodrick prescott trend analysis clearly showed a better performance of the grace mascon estimate. the results showed trends of gwsa(obs) depletion in 5 of the 11 basins. our results indicate that precipitation played an important role in influencing the gwsa(obs) variation in 4 of the 11 basins studied. a combination of rainfall and snowmelt positively influences the gwsa(obs) in six basins. waterbudget analysis showed an availability of comparatively lower terrestrial water in 9 of the 11 basins in the study period. historical groundwater recharge estimates indicate a reduction of groundwater recharge in eight basins during 1960 2009. the output of this study could be used to develop sustainable water withdrawal strategies in alberta, canada."
Bian et al.,2016,Journal of Contemporary Water Research & Education,the effects of policy implementation uncertainty on groundwater extraction,"concerns about the high rate of depletion of the ogallala aquifer in the southern high plains of texas (texas high plains) in recent years have led to the enactment of policies designed to slow down water extraction and increase the usable life of the aquifer. however, policy implementation has not been uniform across the aquifer, leaving some farmers in portions of the aquifer with no effective groundwater extraction restrictions only a short distance away from areas where farmers face regulatory limits. this study investigates the effects of policy implementation uncertainty on the extraction of groundwater. an econometric model is estimated for harvested acreage of the three major crops produced in the five representative counties of the texas high plains. corn acreage (an irrigation  intensive crop) is used as a proxy for groundwater use. after controlling for price and climate effects, it was concluded that there is strong evidence that groundwater use policy uncertainty is likely to increase groundwater extraction in the texas high plains region. the social desire to achieve perpetual sustainability of groundwater resources in the study region, or at the very least to prolong the life of the ogallala aquifer, has resulted in discussions about alternative groundwater management policies. producers, in their concern about the implementation of policies to slow down groundwater extraction, increase their use of water in the short  run in order to maximize profits before groundwater use restriction policies are enforced."
Bianchi et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,"integrating deterministic lithostratigraphic models in stochastic realizations of subsurface heterogeneity. impact on predictions of lithology, hydraulic heads and groundwater fluxes","realistic representations of geological complexity are important to address several engineering and environmental challenges. the spatial distribution of properties controlling physical and geochemical processes can be effectively described by the geological structure of the subsurface. in this work, we present an approach to account for geological structure in geostatistical simulations of categorical variables. the approach is based on the extraction of information from a deterministic conceptualization of the subsurface, which is then used in the geostatistical analysis for the development of models of spatial correlation and as soft conditioning data. the approach was tested to simulate the distribution of four lithofacies in highly heterolithic quaternary deposits. a transition probability based stochastic model was implemented using hard borehole data and soft data extracted from a 3 d deterministic lithostratigraphic model. simulated lithofacies distributions were also used as input in a flow model for numerical simulation of hydraulic head and groundwater flux. the outputs from these models were compared to corresponding values from models based exclusively on borehole data. results show that soft lithostratigraphic information increases the accuracy and reduces the uncertainty of these predictions. the representation of the geological structure also allows a more precise definition of the spatial distribution of prediction uncertainty, here quantified with a metric based on shannon information entropy. correlations between prediction uncertainties for lithofacies, hydraulic heads and groundwater fluxes were also investigated. the results from this analysis provide useful insights about the incorporation of soft geological data into stochastic realizations of subsurface heterogeneity, and emphasize the critical importance of this type of information for reducing the uncertainty of simulations considering flux dependent processes.

Bottcher et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,using isomap to differentiate between anthropogenic and natural effects on groundwater dynamics in a complex geological setting,"due to increasing demands and competition for high quality groundwater resources in many parts of the world, there is an urgent need for efficient methods that shed light on the interplay between complex natural settings and anthropogenic impacts. thus a new approach is introduced, that aims to identify and quantify the predominant processes or factors of influence that drive groundwater and lake water dynamics on a catchment scale. the approach involves a non linear dimension reduction method called isometric feature mapping (isomap). this method is applied to time series of groundwater head and lake water level data from a complex geological setting in northeastern germany. two factors explaining more than 95% of the observed spatial variations are identified: (1) the anthropogenic impact of a waterworks in the study area and (2) natural groundwater recharge with different degrees of dampening at the respective sites of observation. the approach enables a presumption free assessment to be made of the existing geological conception in the catchment, leading to an extension of the conception. previously unknown hydraulic connections between two aquifers are identified, and connections revealed between surfacewater bodies and groundwater.

Bouarfa et al.,2012,Irrigation and Drainage,groundwater in irrigation systems: from menace to mainstay,"irrigation systems have changed significantly in the last 50 years. originally supplied by surfacewater, its farming systems depend increasingly on the massive use of groundwater through private tubewells. withdrawals are currently leading to a general decrease in groundwatertable levels which in the past caused waterlogging due to excess surface irrigation. this new context calls for the repositioning of the paradigm of the twin menace of waterlogging and salinity in which the international commission on irrigation and drainage (icid) community defined its concepts. it also requires taking into consideration existing groundwater institutions, often informal and developed locally, more rarely legally recognized processes when moving towards groundwater governance. we present an analytical framework showing the role of these institutions in groundwater governance. this special issue contains a selection of papers presented at the 24th european regional conference of icid in march 2011, organized by its french national committee, afeid. the selected contributions focus on critical analysis of formal and informal institutions at the local scale dealing with groundwater access, restoring the groundwaterbalance and water quality protection. we argue that these analyses can help building a more process oriented approach to policy and engineering, contributing to new modes of groundwater governance. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd."

Brown et al.,2014,Agricultural Systems,merging remote sensing data and national agricultural statistics to model change in irrigated agriculture,"over 22 million hectares (ha) of u.s. croplands are irrigated. irrigation is an intensified agricultural landuse that increases crop yields and the practice affects water and energy cycles at, above, and below the land surface. until recently, there has been a scarcity of geospatially detailed information about irrigation that is comprehensive, consistent, and timely to support studies tying agricultural landuse change to aquifer water use and other factors. this study shows evidence for a recent overall net expansion of 522 thousand ha across the u.s. (2.33%) and 519 thousand ha (8.7%) in irrigated cropped area across the high plains aquifer (hpa) from 2002 to 2007. in fact, over 97% of the net national expansion in irrigated agriculture overlays the hpa. we employed a modeling approach implemented at two time intervals (2002 and 2007) for mapping irrigated agriculture across the conterminous u.s.

Bruins et al.,2012,Land Degradation & Development,degradation of springs in the arava valley: anthropogenic and climatic factors,"groundwater pumping in the hyper arid arava valley began in 1936 for industrial use, south of the dead sea, and since 1949 for domestic and agricultural use with the establishment of eilat. pumping gradually increased with the founding of 19 rural villages throughout the arava valley. groundwater levels dropped as a result, and springs in the arava valley began to deteriorate. their status had not been studied for decades, and we conducted comprehensive fieldwork of virtually all the known springs on the israeli side of the arava valley, 31 springs, within the period 20082010. our objectives were (i) to determine the current condition of each spring, (ii) to study spring deterioration through time in relation to historical data and (iii) to evaluate anthropogenic and climatic factors through time. our results reveal that only 13 springs discharged water on the landscape surface and 18 springs were found dry. detailed evaluations and time series analyses are presented for the springs: 'ein tamar, 'ein mashak, 'ein evrona and 'ein netafim, selected on the basis of geodiversity. climatic trends in the region were studied using the novel p/pet aridity index (p?=?annual precipitation, pet?=?annual potential evapotranspiration). we calculated yearly p/pet values since 1970 for five meteorological stations in israel and six stations in jordan. all stations, without exception, show a negative downward trend toward increasing aridity, often with significant p values (below 0.10). the change to a drier climate in the region should be considered as an important factor regarding sustainable groundwater management in the arava valley. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Bryan et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,"island groundwater resources, impacts of abstraction and a drying climate: rottnest island, western australia","coastal aquifers provide a source of water for more than one billion people, with island freshwater lenses being some of the most vulnerable coastal groundwater systems due to their susceptibility to saltwater intrusion. basic hydrogeological and hydrochemical knowledge regarding the recharge and salinisation processes of freshwater lenses is important to ensure sustainable utilisation, especially considering possible climate change effects. this paper makes an assessment of the fate of a freshwater lens in a drying climate through a comparison of current and historic hydrochemical data, which to the author's knowledge is unique to this study. fresh groundwater stable isotope signatures (delta o 18, delta h 2) reflect local amount weighted rainfall signatures (delta o 18:  3.8 parts per thousand; delta h 2:  15.1 parts per thousand), and confirm rainfall as the origin of fresh groundwater (delta o 18:  4.47 to  3.82 parts per thousand; delta h 2:  20.0 to  16.6 parts per thousand). mixing with seawater was identified through enriched groundwater delta o 18 and delta h 2 signatures (maximum values of  0.36 parts per thousand and  1.4 parts per thousand respectively) compared to local rainfall and higher salinity (maximum 29,267 mg/l total dissolved solids (tds)) in a number of monitoring wells around the freshwater lens. enhanced seawater intrusion detected in the northern section of the lens area was identified through significantly increased tds values over the last 20 40 years, with increases of up to 3000% observed between 1990 and 2014. a reduction in the extent of freshwater by approximately 1 km(2) was identified since 1977, which was found to be primarily caused by a reduction in recharge to the freshwater lens due to a similar to 20% decline in winter rainfall in the south west western australian region since the mid 1960s. groundwater abstraction was found to equate to between 5% and 9% of the estimated recharge for the island, and is not a significant factor in the reduction of the lens extent compared to the observed decline in rainfall recharge. interestingly, seawater intrusion into the fresh water lens was found to occur by older seawater (0.03 0.09 tu) in regions of the lens that were previously fresh or slightly brackish, while one sample (0.67 tu) suggests either modern seawater intrusion or mixing of older saline groundwaters (>60 years) with rainfall recharge. the use of tritium dating in this island aquifer was essential in identifying 'older' seawater that was previously unidentified until now. the isotopic and hydrochemical tools used in this paper quantify the effects of groundwater abstraction and climate variability on the freshwater lens and have implications for the sustainable management of the groundwater resource on rottnest island, and elsewhere.

Bui et al.,2018,Ecological Indicators,"social sustainability assessment of groundwater resources: a case study of hanoi, vietnam","groundwater plays a key role in public water supplies around the world, and consideration of the social dimension is a key issue in sustainable groundwater management. in hanoi, the capital of vietnam, the situation of groundwater resources is disastrous because the quality has seriously degraded recently. hence, in this study, a social sustainability assessment framework of groundwater resources with a focus on hanoi is proposed for the first time. an analytical hierarchy process (ahp) approach was used to generate the main components (aspects and indicators) of this framework, which has been considered one of the most challenging tasks in ahp sustainability applications. to overcome these challenging tasks, we carefully reviewed and explored the current problems of hanoi groundwater resources to propose 3 main aspects (quantity, quality, and management) and appropriately selected their 13 sustainability indicators for this target area. we introduce a sustainability index function (sif) for indicators to clarify the relationship between each indicator value and its sustainability index. furthermore, we consider both the conventional linear relationship, as it is usually developed in the literature, as well as a non linear sif to arrive at a reasonable sustainability assessment. for the hanoi case study, the sustainability indices obtained using a combined linear and non linear sif method reflect the current problems well, that is, the social sustainability assessment is closer to reality. the sustainability indices of the quantity, quality, and management aspects of the groundwater were appropriately assessed as good, poor, and acceptable, respectively, resulting in hanoi being rated at the acceptable level in the final social sustainability assessment. this result reveals that the population of hanoi is satisfied with the quantity of water but dissatisfied with its current poor quality and its relatively high price."
Butler et al.,2013,Ground Water,interpretation of water level changes in the high plains aquifer in western kansas,"water level changes in wells provide a direct measure of the impact of groundwater development at a scale of relevance for management activities. important information about aquifer dynamics and an aquifer's future is thus often embedded in hydrographs from continuously monitored wells. interpretation of those hydrographs using methods developed for pumping test analyses can provide insights that are difficult to obtain via other means. these insights are demonstrated at two sites in the high plains aquifer in western kansas. one site has thin unconfined and confined intervals separated by a thick aquitard. pumping induced responses in the unconfined interval indicate a closed (surrounded by units of relatively low permeability) system that is vulnerable to rapid depletion with continued development. responses in the confined interval indicate that withdrawals are largely supported by leakage. given the potential for rapid depletion of the unconfined interval, the probable source of that leakage, it is likely that large scale irrigation withdrawals will not be sustainable in the confined interval beyond a decade. a second site has a relatively thick unconfined aquifer with responses that again indicate a closed system. however, unlike the first site, previously unrecognized vertical inflow can be discerned in data from the recovery periods. in years of relatively low withdrawals, this inflow can produce year on year increases in water levels, an unexpected occurrence in western kansas. the prevalence of bounded aquifer responses at both sites has important ramifications for modeling studies; transmissivity values from pumping tests, for example, must be used cautiously in regional models of such systems."

Calderhead et al.,2012,Water Resources Management,sustainable management for minimizing land subsidence of an over pumped volcanic aquifer system: tools for policy design,"groundwater management scenarios for the toluca valley, mexico, are examined with a three dimensional groundwater flow model coupled to a one dimensional compaction module. the objective of this study is to establish a management policy for the sustainable development and management of the toluca aquifer system for minimizing land subsidence. several scenarios are tested by varying 4 main parameters: recharge, exports to other basins, local consumption, and relocating pumping centers. it is apparent that continuing at current rates of water consumption will lead to subsidence of more than 1.6 m over a 40 year period (2010 2050). completely stopping exports to mexico city is not the most important factor in controlling subsidence because the pumping system is mostly located in regions with low clay content, where subsidence is lower. however, decreasing exports by half and relocating the pumping centres to low clay content areas does have a positive effect on the overall waterbudget and subsidence. based on simulation results, it appears that much of the land subsidence could have been avoided had water policies been applied to restrict pumping in regions with compressible materials. the approach taken in this study could be applied to other locations with similar problems in order to determine the most viable option for water supply."

Cao et al.,2013,Environmental Management,"groundwater exploitation management under land subsidence constraint: empirical evidence from the hangzhou jiaxing huzhou plain, china","land subsidence caused by extensive groundwater pumping has become a factor which cannot be ignored in the sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources. the hangzhou jiaxing huzhou plain is one of the locations with china's most severe land subsidence problems; the region has experienced dramatic land subsidence since the 1960s. historical records of groundwater extraction, hydraulic head, and land subsidence show the latter to be the result of continual and excessive extraction of groundwater from deep confined aquifers. this study reconstructs land subsidence using an integrated regional groundwater flow and land subsidence model. the model is calibrated using land subsidence and groundwater level measurements from 1996 to 2007. simulation results reproduce the cones of depression for groundwater heads and nadirs of land subsidence reasonably well. the calibrated model is used to evaluate the efficacy of land subsidence prevention plans from 2008 to 2010, and to predict future land subsidence over the next decade considering several groundwater exploitation scenarios. the results show the main cause of land subsidence to be inelastic compaction of the aquifer system resulting from continuously declining water levels. the model reveals that while the area of land subsidence will continue to extend, the rate of this extension may be significantly decreased by reduction of groundwater extraction. if the current land subsidence prevention and reclamation plans are continued and surfacewater diversion projects implemented, though land subsidence cannot be halted, the rate at which it is occurring can be effectively reduced."
Cao et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,use of flow modeling to assess sustainability of groundwater resources in the north china plain,"the north china plain (ncp) is one of the global hotspots of groundwater depletion. currently, our understanding is limited on spatiotemporal variability in depletion and approaches toward more sustainable groundwater development in this region. this study was intended to simulate spatiotemporal variability in groundwater depletion across the entire ncp and explore approaches to reduce future depletion. simulated predevelopment groundwater recharge (similar to 13 km(3)/yr) primarily discharged as base flow to rivers and evapotranspiration. initial groundwater storage was estimated to be 1500 km(3) of drainable storage in shallow aquifers and 40 km(3) of compressive storage in deep aquifers. simulated groundwater depletion from 1960s to 2008 averaged similar to 4 km(3)/yr. cumulative depletion was 50 km(3) (similar to 20% of pumpage) in the piedmont district, 103 km(3) (similar to 20%) in the central plain, and 5 km(3) (12%) in the coastal plain. however, depletion varied with time: similar to 2.5 km(3)/yr in the 1970s, similar to 4.0 in the 1980s, similar to 2.0 in 1990 1996; similar to 7.0 in 1997 2001, and similar to 4.0 in 2002 2008. recharge also varied spatially, averaging similar to 120 mm/yr and concentrated in the piedmont district (200 350 mm/yr) while lower in the central and coastal plains (50 100 mm/yr). simulation of several alternatives, including managed aquifer recharge, increased water use efficiency, brackish water use, and interbasin water transfer, indicated that the combination of these strategies could be used to recover groundwater storage by 50 km(3) over a 15 year period. this study provides valuable insights for developing more sustainable groundwater management options for the ncp; the methods are useful for managing other depleted aquifers. citation: cao, g., c. zheng, b. r. scanlon, j. liu, and w. li (2013), use of flow modeling to assess sustainability of groundwater resources in the north china plain, water resour. res., 49, doi:10.1029/2012wr011899."
Caputo et al.,2012,Fresenius Environmental Bulletin,hydrogeophysical approach to measure hydraulic parameters on unsaturated rocks,"in the past decade, overexploitation has led to a depletion of water resources, with impact both on quality and quantity. a sustainable groundwater management needs a detailed scientific knowledge of the behaviour of the unsaturated zone. particularly, the evaluation of the flow rate in the unsaturated zone is important to estimate the travel time of the infiltrated water in the subsurface and, hence, to assess the recharge rate and groundwater vulnerability. a quarry of calcarenite near the town of canosa, in south italy, has been chosen to perform the field tests using an integrated hydrogeophysical approach, combining infiltrometer measurements with electrical resistivity tomography (ert). the infiltration data were collected using a metallic infiltrometer ring of 0.5 m in diameter, installed directly on the rock, filled with about 8 l of water. the test was conducted for many hours at falling head condition, and the water level within the ring was measured by means of a pressure transductor and a metric rod fixed to the ring. simultaneously, electrical resistivity measurements were carried out using ""time lapse"" technique, in order to monitor the dynamics of infiltration/redistribution of the water in the unsaturated zone. hydrogeophysical data have been acquired for several hours to obtain a reliable hydrogeological model of the subsurface investigated. field saturated hydraulic conductivity has been determined for the calcarenite, and ert surveys support these results."
Carreira et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,tracing salinization processes in coastal aquifers using an isotopic and geochemical approach: comparative studies in western morocco and southwest portugal,"environmental stable and radioactive isotopes (delta h 2, delta c 13, delta o 18; h 3 and c 14), together with physical and geochemical data, were used in the determination of the origins of groundwater salinization and geochemical evolution processes in coastal regions. two case studies on the atlantic coast are discussed, one located in the essaouira sedimentary basin, western morocco, and the second, in the lower tagus sado sedimentary basin, southwest portugal. in both regions, groundwater degradation occurs by salinization increase to different concentrations and in relation to different origins. the main quality issues for the groundwater resources are related to seawater intrusion, dissolution of diapiric structures intruding the aquifer layers, brine dissolution at depth, and/or evaporation of irrigation water. anthropogenic pollution ascribed to agricultural activities is another source for groundwater degradation, affecting mainly the shallow aquifers. the apparent c 14 age of the analysed samples ranges from 2.9 +/  0.3 up to 45.6 +/  0.6 pmc in the miocene groundwater samples from the basin in portugal; at the essaouira basin in morocco, the c 14 content varies from 60 to 86 pmc. in most of the water samples, the h 3 concentration is below the detection limit. in both basins, the isotopic results together with the geochemical data provided an effective label for tracing the mineralization origin and groundwater degradation processes. further, the isotopic signatures were used in the identification of a paleoclimate (colder period), recorded in the stable isotopic composition and corroborated with the c 14 data."

Carrera-Hernandez et al.,2016,Hydrogeology Journal,"groundwater flow in a transboundary fault dominated aquifer and the importance of regional modeling: the case of the city of quer,taro, mexico","the city of quer,taro, located near the political boundary of the mexican states of quer,taro and guanajuato, relies on groundwater as it sole water supply. groundwater extraction in the city increased from 21 au 10(6) m(3)/yr in 1970 to 104 au 10(6) m(3)/yr in 2010, with an associated drawdown of 100 m in some parts of the aquifer. a three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model has been developed that represents the historical evolution of the aquifer's potentiometric levels and is used to simulate the effect of two scenarios: (1) a 40 % reduction in the extraction rate from public water supply wells in early 2011 (thus reducing the extraction to 62 au 10(6) m(3)/yr), and (2) a further reduction in 2021 to 1 au 10(6) m(3)/yr. the modeling results project a temporary recovery of the potentiometric levels after the 40 % reduction of early 2011, but a return to 2010 levels by 2020. if scenario 2 is implemented in 2021, the aquifer will take nearly 30 years to recover to the simulated levels of 1995. the model also shows that the wells located in the city of quer,taro started to extract water from part of the aquifer beneath the state of guanajuato in the late 1970s, thus showing that the administrative boundaries used in mexico to study and develop water resources are inappropriate, and consideration should be given to physical boundaries instead. a regional approach to studying aquifers is needed in order to adequately understand groundwater flow dynamics."
Carrera-Hernandez et al.,2011,Water Resources Research,effects of aspen harvesting on groundwater recharge and watertable dynamics in a subhumid climate,"numerical experiments were developed using different watertable depths and soil textures to investigate the impact of aspen harvesting on hydrological processes on the western boreal plain. the effect of harvesting on soil moisture dynamics, fluxes at the watertable, and watertable fluctuation were compared for different harvesting scenarios simulated under wet and dry climatic cycles. strong interaction between shallow watertables (i.e., 2 m) and atmospheric variability is observed for all soil textures and is reduced as the vadose zone thickens, particularly after a dry cycle, as a series of positive net atmospheric fluxes are needed to reduce soil moisture storage in order for recharge to occur. because of harvesting, the watertable fluxes can increase by 50 mm month( 1), while on a yearly basis, this increase can reach 200 mm yr( 1), with rainfall events taking between 1 and 5 years to become recharge (i.e., time lag). also, the watertable is expected to rise between 1 and 3.5 m, with rainfall watertable rise time lags of 1 3 years; however, the peak manifestation of harvesting on watertable elevation can take up to 7 years after harvesting. the effects of aspen harvesting are more pronounced during wet cycles, and the development of forestry activities in the boreal plain should consider not only preceding precipitation but also the preceding precipitation reference evapotranspiration ratio, watertable depth, and soil texture. the interaction of these factors needs to be considered in order to develop sustainable forestry plans and avoid waterlogging conditions."
Carriere et al.,2018,Environmental Earth Sciences,"sustainable groundwater resources exploration and management in a complex geological setting as part of a humanitarian project (mahafaly plateau, madagascar)","southwestern madagascar is a semi arid region and a hot spot of global change. on the mahafaly plateau, people live with quasi permanent water stress and groundwater, the only available resource, is difficult to exploit due to a complex hydrogeological environment. a methodology (suitable for humanitarian projects; <40keuro) was developed in four phases to assess the sustainable exploitation of the water resource: (a) regional scale exploration, (b) village scale exploration, (c) drilling campaign, and (d) hydro climatic monitoring. this integrated hydrogeophysical approach involves geophysical measurements (262 tem fast soundings, 2588 slingram measurements, 35 electrical soundings), hydrochemical analyses (112 samples), and a piezometric survey (127 measurements). two groundwater resources were identified, one deep (below 150m) and one shallow (<20m). hydrochemical results highlighted the vulnerability of both resources: anthropic contamination for the shallower and seawater intrusion for the deeper. therefore, subsequent geophysical surveys supported the siting of six boreholes and three wells in the shallow aquifer. this methodological approach was successful in this complex geological setting and requires testing at other sites in and outside madagascar. the study demonstrates that geophysical results should be used in addition to drilling campaigns and to help monitor the water resource. in fact, to prevent overexploitation, piezometric and meteorological sensors were installed to monitor the water resource. this unique hydro climatic observatory may help (1) non governmental organization and local institutions prevent future water shortages and (2) scientists to understand better how global change will affect this region of the world."
Cartwright et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,"a review of radioactive isotopes and other residence time tracers in understanding groundwater recharge: possibilities, challenges, and limitations","documenting the location and magnitude of groundwater recharge is critical for understanding groundwater flow systems. radioactive tracers, notably c 14, h 3, cl 36, and the noble gases, together with other tracers whose concentrations vary over time, such as the chlorofluorocarbons or sulfur hexafluoride, are commonly used to estimate recharge rates. this review discusses some of the advantages and problems of using these tracers to estimate recharge rates. the suite of tracers allows recharge to be estimated over timescales ranging from a few years to several hundred thousand years, which allows both,the long term and modern behaviour of groundwater systems to be documented. all tracers record mean residence times and mean recharge rates rather than a specific age and date of recharge. the timescale over which recharge rates are averaged increases with the mean residence time. this is an advantage in providing representative recharge rates but presents a problem in comparing recharge rates derived from these tracers with those from other techniques, such as watertable fluctuations or lysimeters. in addition to issues relating to the sampling and interpretation of specific tracers, macroscopic dispersion and mixing in groundwater flow systems limit how precisely groundwater residence times and recharge rates may be estimated. additionally, many recharge studies have utilised existing infrastructure that may not be ideal for this purpose (e.g., wells with long screens that sample groundwater several kilometres from the recharge area). ideal recharge studies would collect sufficient information to optimise the use of specific tracers and minimise the problems of mixing and dispersion.

Castano et al.,2018,Hydrological Processes,"long term effects of aquifer overdraft and recovery on groundwater quality in a ramsar wetland: las tablas de daimiel national park, spain","las tablas de daimiel national park is one of spain's most representative groundwater dependent ecosystems. under natural conditions, water inflows combined brackish surfacewater from river giguela with freshwater inputs from river guadiana and the underlying aquifer. since the mid 1970s, aquifer overexploitation caused the desiccation of the wetlands and neighbouring springs. the national park remained in precarious hydrological conditions for three decades, with the only exception of rapid floods due to extreme rainfall events and sporadic water transfers from other basins. in the late 2000s, a decrease in groundwater abstraction and an extraordinarily wet period reversed the trend. the aquifer experienced an unexpected recovery of groundwater levels (over 20m in some areas), thus restoring groundwater discharge to springs and wetlands. the complex historical evolution of the waterbalance in this site has resulted in substantial changes in surface and groundwater quality. this becomes evident when comparing the pre 1980 groundwater quality and the hydrochemical status in the wetland in two different periods, under dry and wet conditions. although the system is close to full recovery from the groundwater level viewpoint, bouncing back in the major hydrochemical constituents has not yet been obtained. these still appear to evolve in response to the previous overexploitation state. moreover, in some sectors, there are groundwater dependent ecosystems that remain different to those found in preoverexploitation times. the experience of las tablas de damiel provides an observatory of long term changes in wetland water quality, demonstrating that the effects of aquifer overexploitation on aquatic ecosystems are more than a mere alteration of the waterbalance and that groundwater quality is the key to aquifer and aquatic ecosystem sustainability."
Castilla-Rho et al.,2017,Nature Human Behaviour,social tipping points in global groundwater management,"groundwater is critical to global food security, environmental flows, and millions of rural livelihoods in the face of climate change. although a third of earth's largest groundwater basins are being depleted by irrigated agriculture, little is known about the conditions that lead resource users to comply with conservation policies. here we developed an agent based model of irrigated agriculture rooted in principles of cooperation and collective action and grounded on the world values survey wave 6 (n = 90,350). simulations of three major aquifer systems facing unsustainable demands reveal tipping points where social norms towards groundwater conservation shift abruptly with small changes in cultural values and monitoring and enforcement provisions. these tipping points are amplified by group size and best invoked by engaging a minority of rule followers. overall, we present a powerful tool for evaluating the contingency of regulatory compliance upon cultural, socioeconomic, institutional and physical conditions, and its susceptibility to change beyond thresholds. managing these thresholds may help to avoid unsustainable groundwater development, reduce enforcement costs, better account for cultural diversity in transboundary aquifer management and increase community resilience to changes in regional climate. although we focus on groundwater, our methods and findings apply broadly to other resource management issues."

Chandra et al.,2019,Scientific Reports,large scale mapping of fractures and groundwater pathways in crystalline hardrock by aem,"in hardrocks that cover about 20% of the earth's surface, it is difficult to locate steady sources for groundwater due to inadequate understanding of the fracture networks. a comprehensive knowledge of fracture distribution at the regional scale is necessary to delineate sustainable aquifers and manage them efficiently. the resistivity maps derived from the airborne electromagnetic (aem) survey over the ankasandra watershed in karnataka, india, reveal sharp and deep zones of low formation resistivity, which indicate groundwater bearing zones. it is found that some of these zones are hydrogeologically connected through fracture networks resulting in augmented yield. aem results in combination with an in depth understanding of the geological structures successfully map these groundwater saturated fracture networks (or hydrogeological lineaments) that we term as 'hydrolins'. as groundwater occurrence is generally associated with lineaments, we analyzed the drilling and geophysical logs from 21 wells within a 380 sq. km area to study the relationships of various lineaments with 'hydrolins', particularly in respect of their groundwater potential. aem results, though calibrated and correlated with a limited number of well data, revealed a threshold groundwater horizon (tgwh), found to be at 80 m depth for ankasandra watershed, beyond which a strong correlation exists between the depth of a well and its yield. while the tgwh may differ for different watersheds, the approach presented here can be readily adopted to map sustainable groundwater sources in hardrocks worldwide."
Chang et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,prediction of monthly regional groundwater levels through hybrid soft computing techniques,"groundwater systems are intrinsically heterogeneous with dynamic temporal spatial patterns, which cause great difficulty in quantifying their complex processes, while reliable predictions of regional groundwater levels are commonly needed for managing water resources to ensure proper service of water demands within a region. in this study, we proposed a novel and flexible soft computing technique that could effectively extract the complex high dimensional input output patterns of basin wide groundwater aquifer systems in an adaptive manner. the soft computing models combined the self organized map (som) and the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (narx) network for predicting monthly regional groundwater levels based on hydrologic forcing data. the som could effectively classify the temporal spatial patterns of regional groundwater levels, the narx could accurately predict the mean of regional groundwater levels for adjusting the selected sum, the kriging was used to interpolate the predictions of the adjusted som into finer grids of locations, and consequently the prediction of a monthly regional groundwater level map could be obtained. the zhuoshui river basin in taiwan was the study case, and its monthly data sets collected from 203 groundwater stations, 32 rainfall stations and 6 flow stations during 2000 and 2013 were used for modelling purpose. the results demonstrated that the hybrid som narx model could reliably and suitably predict monthly basin wide groundwater levels with high correlations (r 2 > 0.9 in both training and testing cases). the proposed methodology presents a milestone in modelling regional environmental issues and offers an insightful and promising way to predict monthly basin wide groundwater levels, which is beneficial to authorities for sustainable water resources management.

Charalambous et al.,2011,Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology,groundwater and the law,"water has its own special characteristics, whether visible and flowing on the surface or invisible underground as groundwater. owing to its mobility, water cannot be easily possessed; without it human survival and the living environment as we know it would not be possible. in european countries and their former colonies, including the americas, water rights have their origins both in civil law from the european continent and in the common law of england. both traditions viewed groundwater as the property of the owner of the land above it, who could use it as he pleased, irrespective of any impact to his neighbours. as long as abstractions remained small, questions of sustainability and impact to others and the environment did not arise. technological progress in the last century caused an explosion in the quantities of groundwater abstracted. it was soon recognized that groundwater, even when renewable, is not inexhaustible and that its overexploitation can lead to unacceptable impacts. in the same period, intensive agriculture, urban expansion and industrial development led to the pollution of groundwaters in many countries. impacts on both quantity and quality prompted legislative changes worldwide. modern legislation has sought to control abstraction by introducing a system of permits or licences granted and regulated by the state, and to protect aquifers from pollution by introducing water quality standards and environmental regulations."
Charlier et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,structure and hydrogeological functioning of an insular tropical humid andesitic volcanic watershed: a multi disciplinary experimental approach,"the aim of the study is to establish an hydrogeological scheme of the structure and the functioning of andesitic volcanic systems in the insular and humid tropical context. a watershed has been instrumented at fefe in guadeloupe (french west indies) in the lesser antilles to measure rainfall, runoff and piezometric fluctuations between 2003 and 2006. given the heterogeneity of the volcanic deposits, a multidisciplinary approach has been used: a geological and an hydrogeological survey, an hydrodynamic approach (hydraulic tests and signal processing of hydrological time series), and finally, an hydrogeochemical approach (major elements and some trace elements). two main superposed aquifer respectively in aerial deposits, and in recent nuees ardentes (glowing ash) and lava flows, as well as the underlying aquiclude (the highly weathered older substratum) were identified. at a local scale, some hydrogeological heterogeneities internal to the aquifers were highlighted and related to a polyphased building up of the geological formations. hydraulic relationships between the multi layered aquifers, such as the confinement of the deep aquifer upstream of the basin, were identified. groundwater/stream exchanges were characterised, detailing various contributions of the shallow and the deep aquifers to stream and spring waters; significant river losses were also observed. at a global scale, within such relatively permeable volcanic formations, the aquifer recharge is about 85% of the annual effective rainfall for an average rainfall year. the hydrogeological scheme appears to be coherent with a geological structure of cut and fill paleovalleys frequently observed in andesitic areas. consequently, groundwater drainage axis are mainly localised in recent nuees ardentes deposits, whereas the inversion of relief characteristic of volcanic areas explains the non superposition of surfacewater and groundwater divides and both surfacewater losses and springs. finally, this work shows the highly heterogeneous hydrogeological processes occurring in volcanic formations of andesitic type. it also shows the relationships between the geological structure and the hydrogeological functioning of such basins, and proposes an affordable methodological approach to investigate such a hydrogeological context in depth.

Chebil et al.,2018,New Medit,policy measures for reducing aquifer depletion in a context of climate change: the case of the coastal area of cap bon (tunisia),"groundwater resources are critically important for irrigated agriculture in tunisia. however, excessive irrigation extractions where groundwater is slowly renewed are causing a widespread depletion of the aquifer systems, with the impacts of climate change expected to further exacerbate this problem. these circumstances call for the development of methodologies and analyses that can support the design of sustainable groundwater management policies. this paper presents a hydro economic mathematical programming model that is used to evaluate the effects of different policy measures for reducing aquifer depletion in the cap bon region of tunisia. three policies have been evaluated: a quota defining the maximum quantity of groundwater extractions, environmental taxation, and supply expansion with subsidized desalinated seawater. overall, results highlight the economic and social tradeoffs among these different policy choices and the challenges facing the implementation of sustainable groundwater management in tunisia. more speccally, results show the advantages of using subsidized desalinated seawater compared to the other two policy alternatives in terms of the value of agricultural production, farmers' profits, and employment, despite of its sizeable budgetary burden."
Chen et al.,2014,Water Resources Management,application of neural networks and optimization model in conjunctive use of surfacewater and groundwater,"this study develops an optimization model for the large scale conjunctive use of surfacewater and groundwater resources. the aim is to maximize public and irrigation water supplies subject to groundwater level drawdown constraints. linear programming is used to create the optimization model, which is formulated as a linear constrained objective function. an artificial neural network is trained by a flow modeling program at specific observation wells, and the network is then incorporated into the optimization model. the proposed methodology is applied to the chou shui alluvial fan system, located in central taiwan. people living in this region rely on large quantities of pumped water for their public and irrigation demands. this considerable dependency on groundwater has resulted in severe land subsidence in many coastal regions of the alluvial fan. consequently, an efficient means of implementing large scale conjunctive use of surfacewater and groundwater is needed to prevent further overuse of groundwater. two different optimization scenarios are considered. the results given by the proposed model show that water usage can be balanced with a stable groundwater level. our findings may assist officials and researchers in establishing plans to alleviate land subsidence problems."

Chen et al.,2016,Water,a new method for evaluating riverside well locations based on allowable withdrawal,"this study aims to derive the optimal solution for well locations based on the allowable withdrawal. to demonstrate the proposed technique, a numerical model of a typical well field at the qinbei power plant was constructed and 20 possible drawdown scenarios were simulated for each of three different arrangements of pumping wells. the concept of the unit increased drawdown value (uidv) was used as a basis to select the location of pumping wells, where the uidv is defined as the increase in drawdown associated with the addition of a unit of extraction. results showed that for modeled well fields with the same number of wells and rates of exploitation, drawdown will reach the maximum and minimum when the well field is located in the recharge zone and discharge zone, respectively, because of the specific relationships between groundwater and surfacewater. this paper considered a pumping program with maximum exploitation and minimum costs corresponding to allowable withdrawals of 2.44 m(3)/s and 1.07 m(3)/s, respectively, and the relationship between groundwater and surfacewater was elucidated. the study results provide a theoretical basis for the layout of wells. the solution takes economic factors into consideration and describes the best solution for well locations to meet drawdown limitations during pumping applications."

Chinnasamy et al.,2013,Earth Interactions,"using remote sensing data to improve groundwater supply estimations in gujarat, india","india is the greatest groundwater consumer in the world, with estimated annual withdrawals exceeding 230 km(3). more than 60% of irrigated agriculture, 85% of drinking water supplies, and 50% of urban and industrial water needs are dependent on sustainable groundwater management. regardless, groundwater overextraction is a growing problem in many regions. predictions of groundwater resource availability in india are problematic in part because of a limited number of monitoring sites and insufficient data quality and quantity. regional groundwater assessments are further complicated because of sporadic and low frequency data. to help overcome these issues and more accurately quantify groundwater resource availability, scientists have begun using satellite derived remote sensing data. in this study, the authors used seasonal and annual hydrologic signals obtained by nasa gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace) satellites and simulated soil moisture variations from land data assimilation systems to show groundwater depletion trends in the northwest state of gujarat (surface area of 196 030 km(2)), india. results were evaluated using direct measurement data from 935 wells. remote sensing generated results compared favorably with well data (e.g., r(2) = 0.89 for gandhinagar, a representative highly urbanized district in gujarat: confidence interval (ci) = 0.05 and p = 0.002). results show that remote sensing is an effective tool to compliment and interpolate observed regional groundwater well data and improve groundwater storage estimations in gujarat, india. properly implemented, the method will supply reliable science based information to enhance management of groundwater resources in india and other geographic locations."

Closas et al.,2018,Water Alternatives-an Interdisciplinary Journal on Water Politics and Development,chronicle of a demise foretold: state vs. local groundwater management in texas and the high plains aquifer system,"this paper assesses a case of co management of groundwater between the state of texas, pushing for the rationalisation of groundwater management, and local (mainly farming) communities organised in groundwater conservation districts (gcds), which are protective of their private groundwater rights. we first describe the main legal and policy steps that have shaped this relationship. the article focuses on the texan portion of the ogallala aquifer in the high plains aquifer system   an almost non renewable system covering 90,000 km(2) and providing 95% of the irrigation needs in northern texas. with this example, we further highlight the strategies of both parties, the different political, administrative, legal and regulatory complexities of the struggle around the definition of gcd level aquifer management rules (the so called 'desired future conditions'). we end by reflecting on the power balance that has resulted from successive adjustments to a co management form of governance, the advantages and disadvantages of a multi layered state water governance system, and whether the de facto 'managed depletion' of the ogallala aquifer in texas should be seen as an achievement or a failure."
Cobbing et al.,2018,Water Sa,an updated waterbalance for the grootfontein aquifer near mahikeng,"the grootfontein aquifer, part of the important north west dolomite aquifers, supplies about 20% of mahikeng's domestic water needs. over abstraction caused the large natural spring draining the aquifer to disappear in 1981, and groundwater levels have since fallen nearly 30 m in the vicinity of the former spring. analysis of water levels and a waterbalance using recent assessments of groundwater abstractions confirm past work describing the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer, and suggest that current abstractions need to fall by between 19 and 36 ml/day (7 and 13 mm(3)/a) to bring the aquifer back into long term balance. continued over abstraction at grootfontein implies increasing risk to mahikeng's water supply, and illuminates the larger challenge of ensuring groundwater use in the north west dolomites that is sustainable and in the public interest."
Cobbing et al.,2018,South African Journal of Science,the grootfontein aquifer: governance of a hydro social system at nash equilibrium,"the grootfontein groundwater aquifer is important to the water supply of the town mahikeng in the north west province of south africa and to commercial agriculture in the province, but the watertable has fallen by up to 28 m as a consequence of over abstraction since the 1980s. institutional and hydrogeological issues impact the aquifer in complex ways, described here as a hydro social system. whilst the hydrogeology is well understood and south african laws provide for sustainable groundwater governance, poor stakeholder collaboration and other institutional problems mean that the over abstraction is likely to persist   an example of an undesirable nash equilibrium. the grootfontein aquifer case shows that groundwater underpins wider social ecological economic systems, and that more holistic management   taking the institutional context into account   is needed to underpin economic growth, employment and other public outcomes. significance: the cost of better natural resource stewardship, including groundwater, is likely to be considerably less than the losses that occur when it is absent. if local groundwater was better managed, it could make water supplies in mahikeng cheaper and more reliable, which would in turn support local economic growth and employment."
Coelho et al.,2018,Journal of Environmental Management,piezometric level and electrical conductivity spatiotemporal monitoring as an instrument to design further managed aquifer recharge strategies in a complex estuarial system under anthropogenic pressure,"recife metropolitan region (rmr, ne brazil) lies over a multi layered aquifer system located in an estuarial area. the region has experienced fast population growth and repeated droughts in the last three decades, which led to unprecedented anthropogenic pressure on groundwater resources because of intense water pumping. accordingly, scientific and stakeholder communities have been challenged to ensure the maintenance of sustainable groundwater resource by managing all water cycle. because controlling pumping rates is difficult due to the large number of illegal wells, the managed aquifer recharge (mar) strategies are now under consideration. the rmr presents a tropical climate and an annual average rainfall rate of approximately 2450 mm year providing great potential volumes of water to be used for piezometric level recovery. however, mar implementation requires a detailed and in depth knowledge of the human impact on the hydrogeological behavior of the resource over the long term, in order to find out the most appropriate recharge strategy. therefore, the present study illustrates how routine data monitoring, i.e., piezometric level and electrical conductivity (ec), in combination with the geological knowledge, may allow proposing further mar strategies. two contrasted behaviors were observed in rmr: (i) groundwater level decrease and stable ec in the north and southernmost areas of recife; and (ii) stable groundwater level and high/varying ec values next to the estuarial zone. although aquifers are undergoing over abstraction, this spatiotemporal heterogeneity suggests that a recharge is possibly locally favored next to the estuarial area of the rmr thanks to hydraulic connections between surface and deep aquifers throughout extended paleo channels. thus, based on this typology, mar implementation through controlled infiltration close to the estuarial area seems to be more appropriated, whereas the direct deep injection appears to be more relevant in more distant zones.

Colins et al.,2016,Earth Sciences Research Journal,gis based assessment of aquifer vulnerability using drastic model: a case study on kodaganar basin,"groundwater is vulnerable and more susceptible to contamination from various anthropogenic elements. various steps are taken to measure the groundwater vulnerability for a sustainable groundwater development. the present study estimates the aquifer vulnerability by applying drastic model in the geographic information system (gis) environment. the drastic model uses seven hydrological parameters which include depth to water level, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, the impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity. drastic index was calculated from drastic model that ranged from 31 to 154. all these parameters characterize the hydrological setting for evaluating aquifer vulnerability. sensitivity analyses have also been performed to determine the sensitivity of every individual drastic parameter towards the aquifer vulnerability. sensitivityanalysis indicated that all the parameters have an almost similar influence on vulnerability index. depth to water parameter inflicts larger impact on aquifer vulnerability followed by recharge, topography and soil media. the whole of kodaganar basin is classified into very low, low, moderate and high vulnerable zones. nearly three fourth of the basin has very low and low vulnerability. incorporating drastic model in the gis environment has proved efficient in handling large volumes of data and in determining the groundwater vulnerability."
Colombani et al.,2017,Journal of Water Supply Research and Technology-Aqua,"impact of climate variability on the salinization of the coastal wetland aquifer system of the po delta, italy","deltaic coastal areas are constituted by a patchwork of brackish lagoons and freshwater bodies; these coastal wetland aquifer systems are fragile ecosystems that usually respond quickly to climate changes. to understand the hydrological processes occurring within the lagoons and the groundwater system of the po river delta (italy), the contribution of both evaporation and anthropogenic factors on groundwater salinization was assessed. a time series (2002 2015) of monthly average climatic data and a temperature salinity dataset were used in three adjacent saline brackish lagoons with the aim to identify the actual evaporation patterns and predict future trends using artificial neural networks (ann). moreover, the use of groundwater and surfacewater equivalent freshwater heads, along with the geological architecture, allowed linking the fluctuation of lagoon salinities with the degree of hydraulic connection between wetland and aquifer system. results show that the less a lagoon is hydraulically connected with the aquifer, the higher is the salinity peak that could be reached at the end of the summer period. ann forecasts highlight that in the near future this behaviour would be the rule rather than the exception. the increase in salinity of surfacewaters could be of serious concern, especially for aquaculture, sensitive to sharp salinity increases."
Colombani et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,misleading reconstruction of seawater intrusion via integral depth sampling,"saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers is an urgent issue for the actual and future groundwater supply and a detailed characterization of groundwater quality with depth is a fundamental prerequisite to correctly distinguish salinization processes. in this study, interpolated cl  maps of the po river delta coastal aquifer (italy), gained with integrated depth sampling (ids) and multi level sampling (mis) techniques, are compared. the data set used to build up the ids and mis interpolated cl  maps come from numerous monitoring campaigns on surface and groundwaters, covering the time frame from 2010 to 2014. the ids interpolated cl  map recalls the phenomenon of actual seawater intrusion, with cl  concentration never exceeding that of seawater and the absence of hypersaline groundwater all over the study area. on the contrary, in the mis interpolated cl  maps the lower portion of the unconfined aquifer presents hypersaline groundwater making it necessary to consider salinization processes other than actual seawater intrusion, like upward flux from a saline aquitard. results demonstrate the obligation of using mis in reconstructing a reliable representation of the distribution of salinity, especially in areas where the density contrast between fresh and saline groundwater is large. implications of the reported field case are not limited to the local situation but have a wider significance, since the ids technique is often employed in saltwater intrusion monitoring even in recent works, with detrimental effect on the sustainable water resource management of coastal aquifers.

Conallin et al.,2014,Knowledge and Management of Aquatic Ecosystems,daytime habitat selection for juvenile parr brown trout (salmo trutta) in small lowland streams,"physical habitat is important in determining the carrying capacity of juvenile brown trout, and within freshwater management. summer daytime physical habitat selection for the parr lifestage (7 20 cm) juvenile brown trout (salmo trutta) was assessed in 6 small lowland streams. habitat preference was determined for the four variables; water velocity, water depth, substrate and cover, and the preferences for physical habitat selection were expressed in terms of habitat suitability indices (hsi's). the statistical confidence of hsi's was evaluated using power analysis. it was found that a minimum of 22 fish observations was needed to have statistical confidence in the hsis for water depth, and a minimum of 92 fish observations for water velocity during daytime summer conditions. generally parr were utilising the deeper habitats, indicating preference for deeper water. cover was also being selected for at all sites, but selection was inconsistent among sites for the variables substrate and velocity. the results indicate that during daytime summer conditions water depth is a significant variable for parr habitat selection in these small lowland streams, with cover also being important. therefore, daytime refugia may be a critical limiting factor for parr in small lowland streams, and important for stream management actions under the water framework directive."
Conrad et al.,2018,California Agriculture,"diverse stakeholders create collaborative, multilevel basin governance for groundwater sustainability","the sustainable groundwater management act (sgma) is introducing significant changes in the way groundwater is governed for agricultural use. it requires the formation of groundwater sustainability agencies (gsas) to manage groundwater basins for sustainability with the engagement of all users. that presents opportunities for collaboration, as well as challenges, particularly in basins with large numbers of agricultural water users who have longstanding private pumping rights. the gsa formation process has resulted in the creation of multiple gsas in many such basins, particularly in the central valley. in case studies of three basins, we examine agricultural stakeholders' concerns about sgma, and how these are being addressed in collaborative approaches to groundwater basin governance. we find that many water districts and private pumpers share a strong interest in maintaining local autonomy, but they have distinct concerns and different options for forming and participating in gsas. multilevel collaborative governance structures may help meet sgma's requirements for broad stakeholder engagement, our studies suggest, while also addressing concerns about autonomy and including agricultural water users in decision making."

Conti et al.,2016,International Environmental Agreements-Politics Law and Economics,global governance principles for the sustainable development of groundwater resources,"a normative framework for the governance of groundwater is emerging at the global level. however, existing analyses have not comprehensively covered all the governance texts that have a bearing on transboundary groundwater resources or looked at them from the perspective of sustainable groundwater governance. therefore, this paper responds to the questions: what are the global governance texts (including international laws) applicable to groundwater resources; to which forms of the resource do they apply; which principles have been included over time; and what are the implications for sustainable development of groundwater resources now and in the future? the analysis highlights key groundwater concepts, discusses twelve global groundwater governance texts and the thirty principles therein, classifies the principles into ideal typical categories based on the sustainable development concept; and assesses the gaps and conflicts between the principles and texts. the paper has three key findings. first, groundwater governance is rapidly evolving and there are a number of principles available to promote sustainable development. second, however, these collective principles do not adequately address (a) the link with all water resources; (b) the potential impact of climate change on water resources; and (c) the impact of trade on equitable sharing of groundwater and protection of groundwater related ecosystems. third, to the extent that this collection of principles can contribute to sustainable development, they are inconsistently included in the legally binding groundwater governance texts. therefore, much progress is needed to ensure a global normative framework that can guide the sustainable governance of groundwater resources."
Cook et al.,2011,Climate Dynamics,irrigation induced surface cooling in the context of modern and increased greenhouse gas forcing,"there is evidence that expected warming trends from increased greenhouse gas (ghg) forcing have been locally 'masked' by irrigation induced cooling, and it is uncertain how the magnitude of this irrigation masking effect will change in the future. using an irrigation dataset integrated into a global general circulation model, we investigate the equilibrium magnitude of irrigation induced cooling under modern (year 2000) and increased (a1b scenario, year 2050) ghg forcing, using modern irrigation rates in both scenarios. for the modern scenario, the cooling is largest over north america, india, the middle east, and east asia. under increased ghg forcing, this cooling effect largely disappears over north america, remains relatively unchanged over india, and intensifies over parts of china and the middle east. for north america, irrigation significantly increases precipitation under modern ghg forcing; this precipitation enhancement largely disappears under a1b forcing, reducing total latent heat fluxes and the overall irrigation cooling effect. over india, irrigation rates are high enough to keep pace with increased evaporative demand from the increased ghg forcing and the magnitude of the cooling is maintained. over china, ghg forcing reduces precipitation and shifts the region to a drier evaporative regime, leading to a relatively increased impact of additional water from irrigation on the surface energy balance. irrigation enhances precipitation in the middle east under increased ghg forcing, increasing total latent heat fluxes and enhancing the irrigation cooling effect. ultimately, the extent to which irrigation will continue to compensate for the warming from increased ghg forcing will primarily depend on changes in the background evaporative regime, secondary irrigation effects (e.g. clouds, precipitation), and the ability of societies to maintain (or increase) current irrigation rates."
Cook et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,quantifying river gain and loss at regional scales,"river aquifer exchange is highly spatially variable. for this reason, methods that estimate river gain or loss over small scales cannot be easily extrapolated to provide flux estimates over the tens to hundreds of kilometres of river length required for regional water management. flux estimates at large scales can be provided by analysis of head gradients, differential flow gauging, river chemistry and groundwater chemistry. hydraulic gradients allow estimation of exchange fluxes over scales of hundreds of metres or more, if piezometers located at similar distances from the river are available for measurement of aquifer heads. however, the difficulty of measuring hydraulic conductivity at this scale, and the need for piezometers at regular intervals along the river, mean that this method is likely to be inaccurate and difficult to apply in many catchments. flow gauging has the potential to estimate fluxes over large scales, although it is difficult to apply in rivers where there is significant surfacewater pumping or where there are large numbers of tributaries. river chemistry can potentially provide estimates of exchange flux over distances of tens to hundreds of kilometres with a spatial resolution of hundreds of metres. groundwater chemistry can provide estimates of loss rates at small to regional scales, depending upon the availability of piezometers for groundwater sampling, and the tracers that are used. each method has its own advantages and limitations, and a combination of methods will usually provide most reliable flux estimates.

Costelloe et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,"determining vertical leakage from the great artesian basin, australia, through up scaling field estimates of phreatic evapotranspiration","understanding the waterbalance of large groundwater systems is fundamental for the sustainable management of the resource. the vertical leakage (i.e. discharge to upper aquifers or the unconfined watertable) component of the great artesian basin (gab) is an example of a poorly constrained but large component of the waterbalance of australia's largest groundwater resource. field estimates of phreatic evapotranspiration (et) were made at discharge zones along the southwestern margin of the gab using eddy covariance station and micro lysimeter measurements, and inversion of chloride/isotope soil profile measurements. the field estimates were assigned to three major landforms associated with areas of increasingly higher evaporative discharge and progressively decreasing depths to the watertable. these landforms were mapped using remote sensing and digital elevation data, with characteristically higher soil moisture, salt precipitation, and lower surface temperature compared to areas distal to discharge zones. based on the field measurements, broad ranges of phreatic et (0.5 10, 10 100 and 100 300 mm y( 1)) were assigned to the major land types. the higher phreatic et discharge zones mapped by supervised classification of satellite data are 8 28% of the total regional vertical leakage component estimated by numerical modelling of the gab. in comparison, the higher discharge zones estimated by landform mapping are 73 251% of the total vertical leakage component estimated by modelling. the mapped distribution of the high discharge areas has important implications for modelling of the gab. in the western sub basin, most of the estimated recharge can be accounted for by phreatic et in the high discharge zones located around the basin margins, implying that vertical leakage rates distal to the margins are very low and that discharge may exceed current recharge. in contrast, the results for the eastern sub basin suggest that vertical leakage rates around the south australian portion of the basin margin are low and that more of the vertical leakage component in the eastern sub basin is occurring distal to the basin margins. consequently, the pathways for vertical leakage in the eastern sub basin are likely to be more complex than for the western sub basin.

Cox et al.,2018,Applied Geochemistry,soil quality changes due to flood irrigation in agricultural fields along the rio grande in western texas,"growing populations demand more food, putting more pressure on soil productivity and sustainability around the world. in western texas along the rio grande valley, the low natural rainfall requires frequent irrigations for sustaining agriculture. to investigate the impacts of irrigation on soil quality, we collected and modelled geochemical data (major elements and nutrients) on irrigation water, soil pore water, drainage water, and soil samples, and monitored soil moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity with sensors from two pecan, one cotton, and one alfalfa fields in western texas. this study showed that flood irrigation with both surface (rio grande river) and groundwaters significantly increased the root zone salinity, soil sodicity, and nutrient leaching from soils to the underlying aquifers and rio grande river from agricultural fields of the arid southwest. the water used for irrigation was high in total dissolved solids (> 500 ppm generally), dominated by na+, cl , ca2+ and so42 . after flood irrigation, infiltrating water dissolved salts such as gypsum that have accumulated in the soils due to previous irrigations, or/and mixed existing concentrated soil waters, and approached saturation with respect to these evaporite minerals. soil water was supersaturated with respect to carbonates as pedogenic calcite precipitated out and reached concentrations of similar to 10 wt% of total soil mass. this suggested that pedogenic carbonate is an important carbon reservoir and precipitation kinetics and controls of such secondary calcite need further investigation for the irrigated agricultural fields in arid regions of the world. chemistry of agricultural return flow samples collected from drainage ditches was similar to that of irrigation water, suggesting that most of the irrigation water had taken a shallow and short flowpath through the fields to drains. between irrigation events, soil water became more concentrated as water was lost through evapo transpiration that led to precipitation of evaporite salts. as a result, sodicity and salinity of soils, especially clayey soils, frequently exceeded the tolerance levels of major crops grown in the region. here in these fine textured soils, combination of high evapotranspiration rates, intensive irrigation with water of elevated salinity, and limited infiltration stunted crop growth, decreased soil porosity and permeability, led to poor aeration, and accelerated salt buildup via a positive feedback mechanism. during initial irrigation where soils were saturated, soil water also percolated and recharged to underlying aquifers, and thus salts, nutrients, and trace metals from agricultural practices (i.e., application of fertilizers, irrigation, soil amendments, and pesticide) could be mobilized to shallow groundwaters. this implied that chemistry of rio grande river, groundwater, and soil was closely linked. thus the sustainability of agriculture depended on appropriate water, soil and crop management practices."
Cox et al.,2013,Journal of Hydrology,"groundwater visualisation system (gvs): a software framework for integrated display and interrogation of conceptual hydrogeological models, data and time series animation","management of groundwater systems requires realistic conceptual hydrogeological models as a framework for numerical simulation modelling, but also for system understanding and communicating this to stakeholders and the broader community. to help overcome these challenges we developed gvs (groundwater visualisation system), a stand alone desktop software package that uses interactive 3d visualisation and animation techniques. the goal was a user friendly groundwater management tool that could support a range of existing real world and pre processed data, both surface and subsurface, including geology and various types of temporal hydrological information. gvs allows these data to be integrated into a single conceptual hydrogeological model. in addition, 3d geological models produced externally using other software packages, can readily be imported into gvs models, as can outputs of simulations (e.g. piezometric surfaces) produced by software such as modflow or feflow. boreholes can be integrated, showing any down hole data and properties, including screen information, intersected geology, water level data and water chemistry. animation is used to display spatial and temporal changes, with time series data such as rainfall, standing water levels and electrical conductivity, displaying dynamic processes. time and space variations can be presented using a range of contouring and colour mapping techniques, in addition to interactive plots of time series parameters. other types of data, for example, demographics and cultural information, can also be readily incorporated. the gvs software can execute on a standard windows or linux based pc with a minimum of 2 gb ram, and the model output is easy and inexpensive to distribute, by download or via usb/dvd/cd. example models are described here for three groundwater systems in queensland, northeastern australia: two unconfined alluvial groundwater systems with intensive irrigation, the lockyer valley and the upper condamine valley, and the surat basin, a large sedimentary basin of confined artesian aquifers. this latter example required more detail in the hydrostratigraphy, correlation of formations with drill holes and visualisation of simulation piezometric surfaces. both alluvial system gvs models were developed during drought conditions to support government strategies to implement groundwater management. the surat basin model was industry sponsored research, for coal seam gas groundwater management and community information and consultation. the ""virtual"" groundwater systems in these 3d gvs models can be interactively interrogated by standard functions, plus production of 2d cross sections, data selection from the 3d scene, rear end database and plot displays. a unique feature is that gvs allows investigation of time series data across different display modes, both 2d and 3d. gvs has been used successfully as a tool to enhance community/stakeholder understanding and knowledge of groundwater systems and is of value for training and educational purposes. projects completed confirm that gvs provides a powerful support to management and decision making, and as a tool for interpretation of groundwater system hydrological processes. a highly effective visualisation output is the production of short videos (e.g. 2 5 min) based on sequences of camera 'fly throughs' and screen images. further work involves developing support for multi screen displays and touch screen technologies, distributed rendering, gestural interaction systems. to highlight the visualisation and animation capability of the gvs software, links to related multimedia hosted online sites are included in the references.

Crosbie et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,"potential climate change effects on groundwater recharge in the high plains aquifer, usa","considering that past climate changes have significantly impacted groundwater resources, quantitative predictions of climate change effects on groundwater recharge may be valuable for effective management of future water resources. this study used 16 global climate models (GCM) and three global warming scenarios to investigate changes in groundwater recharge rates for a 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate in the u.s. high plains region. groundwater recharge was modeled using the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model waves for a variety of soil and vegetation types representative of the high plains. the median projection under a 2050 climate includes increased recharge in the northern high plains (+8%), a slight decrease in the central high plains ( 3%), and a larger decrease in the southern high plains ( 10%), amplifying the current spatial trend in recharge from north to south. there is considerable uncertainty in both the magnitude and direction of these changes in recharge projections. predicted changes in recharge between dry and wet future climate scenarios encompass both an increase and decrease in recharge rates, with the magnitude of this range greater than 50% of current recharge. on a proportional basis, sensitivity of recharge to changes in rainfall indicates that areas with high current recharge rates are least sensitive to change in rainfall and vice versa. sensitivity analyses indicate an amplification of change in recharge compared to change in rainfall, and this amplification is in the range of 1 6 with an average of 2.5 3.5 depending upon the global warming scenario."

Currell et al.,2012,Hydrological Processes,"sustainability of groundwater usage in northern china: dependence on palaeowaters and effects on water quality, quantity and ecosystem health","a synthesis of groundwater ages, recharge rates and information on processes affecting groundwater quality in northern china highlights the major challenges faced for sustainable management of the region's groundwater. direct recharge rates range from hundreds of millimetres per year in the north china plain, to tens of millimetres per year in the loess plateau to less than 4?mm/year in the arid northwest. recharge rates and mechanisms to deep semiconfined and confined aquifers are poorly constrained; however, on the basis of available data, these are likely to be mostly negligible. severe groundwater level declines (0.53?m/year) have occurred throughout northern china in the last three to four decades, particularly in deep aquifers. radiocarbon dating, stable isotope and noble gas data show that the most intensively extracted deep groundwater is palaeowater, recharged under different climate and land cover conditions to the present. reservoir construction has reduced surface runoff in mountain front areas that would naturally recharge regional quaternary aquifers in many basins. in combination with intensive irrigation practices, this has resulted in the main recharge source shifting from surface runoff and mountain front recharge to irrigation returns. this has reduced infiltration of fresh recharge at basin margins and rapidly increased nitrate concentrations and overall mineralisation in phreatic groundwater over wide areas (in some cases to >400?mg/l and >10?g/l, respectively). in some basins, there is evidence that poor quality shallow water has leaked into deep layers (>200?m) via preferential flow, mixing with palaeowaters stored in semiconfined aquifers. high concentrations of naturally occurring fluoride and arsenic (locally >8.5 and >4?mg/l, respectively) have recently lead to the abandonment of numerous supply wells in northern china, creating further pressure on stressed water resources. increasing water demand from direct and indirect consumption poses major challenges for water management in northern china, which must consider the full water cycle. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Currell et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,problems with the application of hydrogeological science to regulation of australian mining projects: carmichael mine and doongmabulla springs,"understanding and managing impacts from mining on groundwater dependent ecosystems (gdes) and other groundwater users requires development of defensible science supported by adequate field data. this usually leads to the creation of predictive models and analysis of the likely impacts of mining and their accompanying uncertainties. the identification, monitoring and management of impacts on gdes are often a key component of mine approvals, which need to consider and attempt to minimise the risks that negative impacts may arise. here we examine a case study where approval for a large mining project in australia (carmichael coal mine) was challenged in court on the basis that it may result in more extensive impacts on a gde (doongmabulla springs) of high ecological and cultural significance than predicted by the proponent. we show that throughout the environmental assessment and approval process, significant data gaps and scientific uncertainties remained unresolved. evidence shows that the assumed conceptual hydrogeological model for the springs could be incorrect, and that at least one alternative conceptualisation (that the springs are dependent on a deep fault) is consistent with the available field data. assumptions made about changes to spring flow as a consequence of mine induced drawdown also appear problematic, with significant implications for the spring fed wetlands. despite the large scale of the project, it appears that critical scientific data required to resolve uncertainties and construct robust models of the springs' relationship to the groundwater system were lacking at the time of approval, contributing to uncertainty and conflict. for this reason, we recommend changes to the approval process that would require a higher standard of scientific information to be collected and reviewed, particularly in relation to key environmental assets during the environmental impact assessment process in future projects.

Custodio et al.,2016,Science of the Total Environment,"groundwater intensive use and mining in south eastern peninsular spain: hydrogeological, economic and social aspects","intensive groundwater development is a common circumstance in semiarid and arid areas. often abstraction exceeds recharge, thus continuously depleting reserves. there is groundwater mining when the recovery of aquifer reserves needs more than 50 years. the mase project has been carried out to compile what is known about spain and specifically about the south eastern iberian peninsula and the canary islands. the objective was the synthetic analysis of available data on the hydrological, economic, managerial, social, and ethical aspects of groundwater mining. since the mid 20th century, intensive use of groundwater in south eastern spain allowed extending and securing the areas with traditional surfacewater irrigation of cash crops and their extension to former dry lands, taking advantage of good soils and climate. this fostered a huge economic and social development. intensive agriculture is a main activity, although tourism plays currently an increasing economic role in the coasts. many aquifers are relatively high yielding small carbonate units where the total groundwater level drawdown may currently exceed 300 m. groundwater storage depletion is estimated about 15 km(3). this volume is close to the total contribution of the tagus segura water transfer, but without large investments paid for with public funds. seawater desalination complements urban supply and part of cash crop cultivation. reclaimed urban waste water is used for irrigation. groundwater mining produces benefits but associated to sometimes serious economic, administrative, legal and environmental problems. the use of an exhaustible vital resource raises ethical concerns. it cannot continue under the current legal conditions. a progressive change of water use paradigm is the way out, but this is not in the mind of most water managers and politicians. the positive and negative results observed in south eastern spain may help to analyse other areas under similar hydrogeological conditions in a less advanced stage of water use evolution.

Custodio et al.,2016,Science of the Total Environment,"groundwater intensive exploitation and mining in gran canaria and tenerife, canary islands, spain: hydrogeological, environmental, economic and social aspects","intensive exploitation and continuous consumption of groundwater reserves (groundwater mining) have been real facts for decades in arid and semiarid areas. a summary of experience in the hydrogeological, economic, social and ethical consequences of groundwater intensive and mining exploitation in gran canaria and tenerife islands, in the canarian archipelago, is presented. groundwater abstraction is less than recharge, but a significant outflow of groundwater to the sea cannot be avoided, especially in tenerife, due to its younger volcanic coastal formations. consequently, the intensive aquifer groundwater development by means of wells and water galleries (tunnels) has produced a groundwater reserve depletion of about 2 km(3). should current groundwater abstraction cease, the recovery time to close to natural conditions is from decades to one century, except in the mid and high elevations of tenerife, where this recovery is not possible as aquifer formations will remain permanently drained by the numerous long water galleries. the socio economic circumstances are complex due to a long standing history of water resources exploitation, successive social changes on each island, and well established groundwater water trading, with complex relationships that affect water governance and the resulting ethical concerns. gran canaria and tenerife are in an advanced groundwater exploitation stage and have a large water demand. they are good examples that allow drawing guidelines to evaluate groundwater development on other small high islands. after presenting the hydrogeological background, the socio economic results are discussed to derive general knowledge to guide on water governance.

Daher et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,karst and artificial recharge: theoretical and practical problems a preliminary approach to artificial recharge assessment,"managed aquifer recharge (mar) is an emerging sustainable technique that has already generated successful results and is expected to solve many water resource problems, especially in semi arid and arid zones. it is of great interest for karst aquifers that currently supply 20 25% of the world's potable water, particularly in mediterranean countries. however, the high heterogeneity in karst aquifers is too complex to be able to locate and describe them simply via field observations. hence, as compared to projects in porous media, mar is still marginal in karst aquifers. accordingly, the present work presents a conceptual methodology for aquifer rechargeability assessment in karst   referred to as arak. the methodology was developed noting that artificial recharge in karst aquifers is considered an improbable challenge to solve since karst conduits may drain off recharge water without any significant storage, or recharge water may not be able to infiltrate. the aim of the arak method is to determine the ability of a given karst aquifer to be artificially recharged and managed, and the best sites for implementing artificial recharge from the surface. arak is based on multi criteria indexation analysis modeled on karst vulnerability assessment methods. arak depends on four independent criteria, i.e. epikarst, rock, infiltration and karst. after dividing the karst domain into grids, these criteria are indexed using geological and topographic maps refined by field observations. arak applies a linear formula that computes the intrinsic rechargeability index based on the indexed map for every criterion, coupled with its attributed weighting rate. this index indicates the aptitude for recharging a given karst aquifer, as determined by studying its probability first on a regional scale for the whole karst aquifer, and then by characterizing the most favorable sites. subsequently, for the selected sites, a technical and economic feasibility factor is applied, weighted by the difficulties that could occur when trying to undertake a recharge operation at a selected site from the surface. each site is finally rated by its rechargeability index   the product of two factors, the intrinsic rechargeability and the feasibility index. arak was applied to the region of damour, lebanon, on the mediterranean coast where uncontrolled exploitation of public and private wells led to its partial salinization by seawater. a mar system in damour region represents an interesting solution to cope with salinization and the insufficiency of the resource.

Dahlke et al.,2018,California Agriculture,streamflow availability ratings identify surfacewater sources for groundwater recharge in the central valley,"in california's semi arid climate, replenishment of groundwater aquifers relies on precipitation and runoff during the winter season. however, climate projections suggest more frequent droughts and fewer years with above normal precipitation, which may increase demand on groundwater resources and the need to recharge groundwater basins. using historical daily streamflow data, we developed a spatial index and rating system of high magnitude streamflow availability for groundwater recharge, starr, in the central valley. we found that watersheds with excellent and good availability of excess surfacewater are primarily in the sacramento river basin and northern san joaquin valley. starr is available as a web tool and can guide water managers on where and when excess surfacewater is available and, with other web tools, help sustainable groundwater agencies develop plans to balance water demand and aquifer recharge. however, infrastructure is needed to transport the water, and also changes to the current legal restrictions on use of such water."
Darby et al.,2015,Environmental Science-Processes & Impacts,a first look at the influence of anthropogenic climate change on the future delivery of fluvial sediment to the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta,"we employ a climate driven hydrological waterbalance and sediment transport model (hydrotrend) to simulate future climate driven sediment loads flowing into the ganges brahmaputra meghna (gbm) mega delta. the model was parameterised using high quality topographic data and forced with daily temperature and precipitation data obtained from downscaled regional climate model (rcm) simulations for the period 1971 2100. three perturbed rcm model runs were selected to quantify the potential range of future climate conditions associated with the sres a1b scenario. fluvial sediment delivery rates to the gbm delta associated with these climate data sets are projected to increase under the influence of anthropogenic climate change, albeit with the magnitude of the increase varying across the two catchments. of the two study basins, the brahmaputra's fluvial sediment load is predicted to be more sensitive to future climate change. specifically, by the middle part of the 21st century, our model results suggest that sediment loads increase (relative to the 1981 2000 baseline period) over a range of between 16% and 18% (depending on climate model run) for the ganges, but by between 25% and 28% for the brahmaputra. the simulated increase in sediment flux emanating from the two catchments further increases towards the end of the 21st century, reaching between 34% and 37% for the ganges and between 52% and 60% for the brahmaputra by the 2090s. the variability in these changes across the three climate change simulations is small compared to the changes, suggesting they represent a significant increase. the new data obtained in this study offer the first estimate of whether and how anthropogenic climate change may affect the delivery of fluvial sediment to the gbm delta, informing assessments of the future sustainability and resilience of one of the world's most vulnerable mega deltas. specifically, such significant increases in future sediment loads could increase the resilience of the delta to sea level rise by giving greater potential for vertical accretion. however, these increased sediment fluxes may not be realised due to uncertainties in the monsoon related response to climate change or other human induced changes in the catchment: this is a subject for further research."
Darby et al.,2016,Nature,fluvial sediment supply to a mega delta reduced by shifting tropical cyclone activity,"the world's rivers deliver 19 billion tonnes of sediment to the coastal zone annually(1), with a considerable fraction being sequestered in large deltas, home to over 500 million people. most (more than 70 per cent) large deltas are under threat from a combination of rising sea levels, ground surface subsidence and anthropogenic sediment trapping(2,3), and a sustainable supply of fluvial sediment is therefore critical to prevent deltas being ` drowned' by rising relative sea levels(2 4). here we combine suspended sediment load data from the mekong river with hydrological model simulations to isolate the role of tropical cyclones in transmitting suspended sediment to one of the world's great deltas. we demonstrate that spatial variations in the mekong's suspended sediment load are correlated (r = 0.765, p < 0.1) with observed variations in tropical cyclone climatology, and that a substantial portion (32 per cent) of the suspended sediment load reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated by rainfall associated with tropical cyclones. furthermore, we estimate that the suspended load to the delta has declined by 52.6 +/  10.2 megatonnes over recent years (1981 2005), of which 33.0 +/  7.1 megatonnes is due to a shift in tropical cyclone climatology. consequently, tropical cyclones have a key role in controlling the magnitude of, and variability in, transmission of suspended sediment to the coast. it is likely that anthropogenic sediment trapping in upstream reservoirs is a dominant factor in explaining past(5 7), and anticipating future(8,9), declines in suspended sediment loads reaching the world's major deltas. however, our study shows that changes in tropical cyclone climatology affect trends in fluvial suspended sediment loads and thus are also key to fully assessing the risk posed to vulnerable coastal systems."
Davids et al.,2015,Groundwater,sustainable capture: concepts for managing stream aquifer systems,"most surfacewater bodies (i.e., streams, lakes, etc.) are connected to the groundwater system to some degree so that changes to surfacewater bodies (either diversions or importations) can change flows in aquifer systems, and pumping from an aquifer can reduce discharge to, or induce additional recharge from streams, springs, and lakes. the timescales of these interactions are often very long (decades), making sustainable management of these systems difficult if relying only on observations of system responses. instead, management scenarios are often analyzed based on numerical modeling. in this paper we propose a framework and metrics that can be used to relate the theis concepts of capture to sustainable measures of stream aquifer systems. we introduce four concepts: sustainable capture fractions, sustainable capture thresholds, capture efficiency, and sustainable groundwater storage that can be used as the basis for developing metrics for sustainable management of stream aquifer systems. we demonstrate their utility on a hypothetical stream aquifer system where pumping captures both streamflow and discharge to phreatophytes at different amounts based on pumping location. in particular, capture efficiency (ce) can be easily understood by both scientists and non scientist alike, and readily identifies vulnerabilities to sustainable stream aquifer management when its value exceeds 100%."
Davidsen et al.,2016,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,the cost of ending groundwater overdraft on the north china plain,"overexploitation of groundwater reserves is a major environmental problem around the world. in many river basins, groundwater and surfacewater are used conjunctively and joint optimization strategies are required. a hydroeconomic modeling approach is used to find cost optimal sustainable surfacewater and groundwater allocation strategies for a river basin, given an arbitrary initial groundwater level in the aquifer. a simplified management problem with conjunctive use of scarce surfacewater and groundwater under inflow and recharge uncertainty is presented. because of head dependent groundwater pumping costs the optimization problem is nonlinear and non convex, and a genetic algorithm is used to solve the one step ahead subproblems with the objective of minimizing the sum of immediate and expected future costs. a real world application in the water scarce ziya river basin in northern china is used to demonstrate the model capabilities. persistent overdraft from the groundwater aquifers on the north china plain has caused declining groundwater levels. the model maps the marginal cost of water in different scenarios, and the minimum cost of ending groundwater overdraft in the basin is estimated to be cny5.58 billion yr( 1). the study shows that it is cost effective to slowly recover the groundwater aquifer to a level close to the surface, while gradually lowering the groundwater value to the equilibrium at cny2.15 m( 3). the model can be used to guide decision makers to economic efficient long term sustainable management of groundwater and surfacewater resources."

Deines et al.,2019,Environmental Research Letters,quantifying irrigation adaptation strategies in response to stakeholder driven groundwater management in the us high plains aquifer,"irrigation enhances agricultural yields and stabilizes farmer incomes, but overexploitation has depleted groundwater resources around the globe. strategies to address this sustainability challenge differ widely. socio ecological systems research suggests that management of common pool resources like groundwater would benefit from localized approaches that combine self organization along with active monitoring. in 2012, the us state of kansas established a local enhanced management area (lema) program, empowering farmers to work with local and state officials to develop five year, enforceable groundwater conservation programs. here, we assessed the efficacy of the firstlema implemented from 2013 to 2017 using a causal impact methodology based on bayesian structural time series that is new to agrohydrology. compared to control scenarios, we found that the lemareduced water use by 31% over the five year period, with early indications of stabilizing groundwater levels. three main conservation strategies can lead to reduced water use: (1) reducing irrigated area, (2) reducing irrigation amount applied to existing crops through improved efficiency, and/or (3) switching to crops that require less water. to partition water savings among these strategies, we combined satellite derived irrigated areas and crop type maps with well records. wefound that farmers were able to largely maintain irrigated area and achieved the majority of pumping reductions (72%) from improvements in irrigation efficiency, followed by expansion of crops with lower water demand (19%). the results of this analysis demonstrate that conservation programs that are irrigatordriven with regulatory oversight can provide a path toward sustainability in stressed aquifers."

Delottier et al.,2017,Water Resources Management,why should practitioners be concerned about predictive uncertainty of groundwater management models?,"numerical models are now commonly used to define guidelines for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. despite significant advances in inverse modeling and uncertainty analysis, most of groundwater management models are still calibrated by manual trial and error and disregard predictive uncertainty. there is a gap between recent advances in inverse modeling and current practices in operational groundwater modeling. the disinterest of water practitioners for this issue can be explained by unawareness, lack of relevant and reliable datasets, difficulties of implementation and prohibitive computation times. the purpose of this study is to convince water practitioners and water managers that uncertainty analysis is not just a smart, optional add on to a groundwater model, but rather a critical and necessary step. so as to broaden the audience of this paper out of the community of specialists, we use a simple didactic illustration and propose realistic, practical solutions. based on a synthetic model, we highlight that if we follow common practices (parameter calibration solely against observed groundwater heads), our knowledge of the unknown parameters is not sufficient to constrain the predicted value of interest (the sustainable yield). this is a critical issue since management models are likely to be used for the design of legal frameworks. after this illustration, we argue that calibration algorithms should become a routine process to bring the uncertainty analysis to the forefront. we promote the use of a linear uncertainty analysis as a diagnostic tool for large real world groundwater management models. when uncertainty is high, stakeholders should encourage the collection of multiple data sets to expand the calibration data set and gather prior information on parameter values."
Delottier et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,estimating groundwater recharge uncertainty from joint application of an aquifer test and the watertable fluctuation method,"specific yield and groundwater recharge of unconfined aquifers are both essential parameters for groundwater modeling and sustainable groundwater development, yet the collection of reliable estimates of these parameters remains challenging. here, a joint approach combining an aquifer test with application of the watertable fluctuation (wtf) method is presented to estimate these parameters and quantify their uncertainty. the approach requires two wells: an observation well instrumented with a pressure probe for long term monitoring and a pumping well, located in the vicinity, for the aquifer test. the derivative of observed drawdown levels highlights the necessity to represent delayed drainage from the unsaturated zone when interpreting the aquifer test results. groundwater recharge is estimated with an event based wtf method in order to minimize the transient effects of flow dynamics in the unsaturated zone. the uncertainty on groundwater recharge is obtained by the propagation of the uncertainties on specific yield (bayesian inference) and groundwater recession dynamics (regression analysis) through the wtf equation. a major portion of the uncertainty on groundwater recharge originates from the uncertainty on the specific yield. the approach was applied to a site in bordeaux (france). groundwater recharge was estimated to be 335mm with an associated uncertainty of 86.6mm at 2 sigma. by the use of cost effective instrumentation and parsimonious methods of interpretation, the replication of such a joint approach should be encouraged to provide reliable estimates of specific yield and groundwater recharge over a region of interest. this is necessary to reduce the predictive uncertainty of groundwater management models."
Devineni et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,assessing chronic and climate induced water risk through spatially distributed cumulative deficit measures: a new picture of water sustainability in india,"india is a poster child for groundwater depletion and chronic water stress. often, water sustainability is measured through an estimate of the difference between the average supply and demand in a region. however, water supply and demand are highly variable in time and space. hence, measures of scarcity need to reflect temporal imbalances even for a fixed location. we introduce spatially distributed indices of water stress that integrate over time variations in water supply and demand. the indices reflect the maximum cumulative deficit in a regional waterbalance within year and across years. this can be interpreted as the amount that needs to be drawn from external storage (either aquifers or surface reservoirs or interarea transfers) to meet the current demand pattern given a variable climate and renewable water supply. a simulation over a long period of record (historical or projected) provides the ability to quantify risk. we present an application at a district level in india considering more than a 100 year data set of rainfall as the renewable supply, and the recent water use pattern for each district. consumption data are available through surveys at the district level, and consequently, we use this rather than river basins as the unit of analysis. the rainfall endogenous to each district is used as a potentially renewable water supply to reflect the supply demand imbalances directly at the district level, independent of potential transfers due to upstream induced runoff or canals. the index is useful for indicating whether small or large surface storage will suffice, or whether the extent of groundwater storage or external transfers, or changes in demand are needed to achieve a sustainable solution. implications of the analysis for india and for other applications are discussed."

Dogramaci et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,stable isotope and hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the semi arid hamersley basin of subtropical northwest australia,"the hamersley basin, in the semi arid pilbara region of northwest australia, is currently subject to increasing pressure from altered hydrology associated with mining activities as well as water abstraction for regional development. sustainable water management across the region must be underpinned by an understanding of the factors that constrain water supply in arid zones. we measured the amount and isotopic signature of individual rainfall events over three consecutive years (2009 2011) to determine the likely processes that control surfacewater pools in streams and groundwater recharge across the hamersley basin. we also measured concentrations of ions (in particular bromide and chloride) to define and quantify sources of major recharge. stable isotope composition of precipitation across the basin forms a local meteoric water line (lmwl) defined by the equation: delta h 2 = 7.03 +/  0.17 x delta o 18 + 4.78 +/  1.45. thus, the slope of the lmwl was similar to the global meteoric water line (gmwl). however, the intercept of the lmwl was significantly different to the gmwl, which is attributable to the amount or ""rainout"" effect. the stable isotope composition of rainfall events was highly variable and dependent on event size. however, the delta h 2 and delta o 18 values of fresh groundwater from the alluvium and fractured aquifers were similar and characterised by a very narrow range (alluvium aquifer delta o 18  8.02 +/  0.83 parts per thousand, delta h 2  55.6 +/  6.0 parts per thousand, n = 65; fractured aquifer delta o 18  8.22 +/  0.70%o, delta h 2 56.9 +/  5.0 parts per thousand, n = 207). our findings suggest that intense rainfall events of >20 mm with limited evaporation prior to infiltration contribute most to recharge. in contrast, the delta h 2 and delta o 18 values and chemical composition of the relatively saline groundwater in the terminal fortescue marsh suggest a combination of evaporation and cyclic drying and wetting of the marsh surface prior to recharge. saline groundwater samples were more o 18 enriched than fresh groundwater; delta h 2 and delta o 18 values shifted to the right of the lmwl, forming a straight line with a slope of 3.58 +/  0.20 and an intercept of  25.55 +/  0.71 (r 2 = 0.95, p < 0.001. n = 18). the stable isotope mass balance for most of the surfacewater pools in the basin show significant evaporation and are highly enriched compared to underlying groundwater. we conclude that significant seepage from highly evaporated pools to groundwater is very limited.

Dou et al.,2016,Water Policy,a critical review of groundwater utilization and management in china's inland water shortage areas,"groundwater, as an important store of freshwater, plays a more critical role in sustaining the ecosystem and enhancing human adaptation to changing climate than surfacewater. in particular, it can store large volumes of water to naturally buffer the pressure of water shortage against seasonal changes in rainfall. however, groundwater itself is also vulnerable to climate change, showing a great change in hydrologic cycle. therefore, effective groundwater management has a strategic importance for china's water security. at present, china is facing a groundwater crisis because of the dual effects of natural and anthropogenic factors. many new ideas and solutions have been given in previous studies on groundwater utilization and management. this paper vividly captures these studies. the paper summarizes groundwater properties and the situation of groundwater development and utilization. the paper also reports challenges, strategies and policies in groundwater sustainability."
Doyle et al.,2015,Water Resources Research,using noble gas tracers to constrain a groundwater flow model with recharge elevations: a novel approach for mountainous terrain,"environmental tracers provide information on groundwater age, recharge conditions, and flow processes which can be helpful for evaluating groundwater sustainability and vulnerability. dissolved noble gas data have proven particularly useful in mountainous terrain because they can be used to determine recharge elevation. however, tracer derived recharge elevations have not been utilized as calibration targets for numerical groundwater flow models. herein, we constrain and calibrate a regional groundwater flow model with noble gas derived recharge elevations for the first time. tritium and noble gas tracer results improved the site conceptual model by identifying a previously uncertain contribution of mountain block recharge from the coast mountains to an alluvial coastal aquifer in humid southwestern british columbia. the revised conceptual model was integrated into a three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model and calibrated to hydraulic head data in addition to recharge elevations estimated from noble gas recharge temperatures. recharge elevations proved to be imperative for constraining hydraulic conductivity, recharge location, and bedrock geometry, and thus minimizing model nonuniqueness. results indicate that 45% of recharge to the aquifer is mountain block recharge. a similar match between measured and modeled heads was achieved in a second numerical model that excludes the mountain block ( no mountain block recharge), demonstrating that hydraulic head data alone are incapable of quantifying mountain block recharge. this result has significant implications for understanding and managing source water protection in recharge areas, potential effects of climate change, the overall waterbudget, and ultimately ensuring groundwater sustainability."

Duque et al.,2018,Environmental Earth Sciences,estimating the waterbudget in a semi arid region (torrevieja aquifer south east spain) by assessing groundwater numerical models and hydrochemical data,"the driest area of europe is located in the south east of spain. in this region, water plays an essential role for the development and maintenance of the major economical engines for society, tourism and agriculture. in the coastal areas, water scarcity increases the risk of saltwater intrusion connected also to the overexploitation of aquifers. the adequate management of coastal aquifers requires to integrate climatic and hydrogeological information, but it is common to find incomplete datasets and uncertainties about the sources and sinks of water. the torrevieja coastal aquifer gathers all these challenges with limited information available and essential questions about the aquifer functioning. the waterbudget has an imbalance between inputs from precipitation irrigation return and outputs connected to water supply pumping for population and agriculture. initial estimates indicate an annual deficit of 4.36 mm(3) that would produce short term changes in the hydrodynamic system. however, the aquifer has been continuously exploited for the last 30 years which indicates the necessity of reviewing the hydrogeological characteristics of the region. a set of new conceptual models has been tested with numerical models to present alternative possibilities about the hydrogeological functioning combined with the analysis of hydrochemical data. the evaluation of the conceptual models revealed that up to 75% of the groundwater being extracted could proceed from a lower aquifer that has not been monitored. the improved waterbudget indicated a much lower annual deficit in the torrevieja aquifer (0.2 0.8 mm(3)) occasionally positive in years with high precipitation but introduces new questions about the recharge and origin of groundwater in the lower aquifer. in semi arid areas, water is crucial facing climatic change and desertification processes; in this work, it is presented how the use of numerical models combined with hydrochemical information is a useful approach to provide new perspectives and improve water management."
Dvory et al.,2018,Water,quantification of groundwater recharge from an ephemeral stream into a mountainous karst aquifer,"sustainable groundwater production from karst aquifers is primarily dictated by its recharge rate. therefore, it is essential to accurately quantify annual groundwater recharge in order to limit overexploitation and to evaluate artificial methods for groundwater enrichment. infiltration during erratic flood events in karst basins may substantially contribute to aquifer recharge. however, the complicated nature of karst systems, which are characterized in part by multiple springs, sinkholes, and losing/gaining streams, impede accurate quantification of the actual contribution of flood waters to groundwater recharge. in this study, we aim to quantify the proportion of groundwater recharge accrued during runoff events in a karst aquifer. the role of karst conduits on flash flood infiltration was examined during four flood and controlled runoff events in the soreq creek near jerusalem, israel. we distinguished between direct infiltration, percolation through karst conduits, and diffuse infiltration the latter of which is most affected by evapotranspiration. a waterbalance was calculated for the 2014/15 hydrological year using the hydrologic engineering center hydrologic modelling system (hec hms). simulations show that 6.8 to 19.2% of the annual recharge volume was added to the aquifer from infiltration of runoff losses along the creek through the karst system."
Dyble et al.,2017,California Law Review,aquifers and democracy: enforcing voter equal protection to save california's imperiled groundwater and redeem local government,"california's sustainable groundwater management act (""sgma"") allows local entities that represent landowners, government agencies, or private companies, rather than the public, to take on exclusive power to regulate and manage imperiled groundwater resources. in at least some cases, under sgma these entities are governed and controlled in ways that violate the one person, one vote requirement of the equal protection clause, and even the rational basis requirement for local government representational structures. by establishing the state's first comprehensive requirements for monitoring and managing groundwater, sgma attempts to fill a critical gap in california water regulation, the consequences of which have culminated in a statewide crisis. this note examines the ways in which sgma implicates the fourteenth amendment, and, specifically, the requirements for proportional representation in local government that avery v. midland county and board of estimate v. morris established. it argues that voter accountability and proportional representation in groundwater governance are important to actually achieving the ultimate goal of the legislation: effective management and regulation of imperiled common pool resources in california. it also contributes to solving a bigger problem. special districts are the most numerous type of local government in the united states, with policy making and administrative responsibility for vital environmental resources, infrastructure, and services. enforcement of the one person, one vote requirement for the special districts responsible for california groundwater under sgma would provide a powerful legal precedent for citizens seeking to promote democracy and equality in local government throughout the united states."
Dyer et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,identification of recharge zones in the lower mississippi river alluvial aquifer using high resolution precipitation estimates,"water resources in the lower mississippi river alluvial valley play a critical role in agricultural productivity due to the widespread use of irrigation during the growing season. however, the unknown specifics of surface atmosphere feedbacks in the region, along with diminishing groundwater availability and the non sustainable trend in irrigation draws from the alluvial aquifer, makes it difficult for water resource managers to make sound decisions for future water sustainability. as a result, it is crucial to identify spatial and temporal associations between local rainfall patterns and groundwater levels to determine the influence of precipitation on regional aquifer recharge. specifically, it is critical to define the recharge zones of the aquifer so that rainfall distribution can be used to assess potential groundwater recovery. this project addresses the issue of defining areas of recharge in the lower mississippi river alluvial aquifer (lmraa) through an assessment of historical precipitation variability using high resolution radar derived precipitation estimates. a rotated principal component analysis (rpca) of both groundwater and precipitation data from october through april is used to define locations where aquifer levels show the greatest variability, with a stepwise regression approach used to define areas where rainfall and groundwater levels show the strongest association. results show that the greatest recharge through direct rainfall is along the tallahatchie river basin in the northeastern mississippi delta, with recharge along the periphery of the lmraa likely a result of direct water flux from surface hydrologic features.

Eissa et al.,2018,Hydrology,"application of multi isotopes and geochemical modeling for delineating recharge and salinization sources in dahab basin aquifers (south sinai, egypt)","the dahab watershed comprises three aquifers; the alluvial quaternary, the early cambrian sandstone, and the fractured pre cambrian basement aquifers. the dahab watershed is located in the southeastern part of the arid sinai peninsula, where low precipitation and groundwater overexploitation deteriorate the groundwater quality in the alluvial coastal plain aquifer located downstream. multi isotopes including delta o 18 and delta h 2, sr 87/sr 86, delta br 81 and delta b 11 coupled with groundwater geochemistry were utilized to assess the recharge source(s), water rock interaction, and seawater mixing to aid sustainable groundwater management strategies. br and cl concentrations, used to measure groundwater salinity, were low in the upstream groundwater, while higher concentrations were observed in the deep drilled wells located downstream, in the main well field. the delta o 18 and delta h 2 isotopes were depleted in the upstream aquifers, but enriched in the shallow coastal aquifer, indicating slight evaporation and seawater intrusion. higher mean values of sr 87/sr 86 and delta br 81 were observed in the fresh groundwater from high in the watershed (sr 87/sr 86 = 0.707716 and delta br 81 = + 2.05 parts per thousand), while lower mean values were observed in the saline groundwater located downstream in the main well field (sr 87/sr 86 = 0.706631 and delta br 81 = + 0.11 parts per thousand). the cumulative mass balance mixing curves and the geochemical netpath model confirm the change of groundwater quality from the upper to lower watershed caused by the leaching and evaporation processes, as well as mixing with seawater. the corrected c 14 age dating and stable isotopes show that the quaternary and pre cambrian basement aquifers contain modern groundwater, while the early cambrian aquifer holds paleo groundwater, which has received considerable recharge from recent precipitation. the mixing ratiosin the quaternary coastal aquifer range between 5% and 13% seawater to 95% and 87% fresh groundwater, respectively. these results indicate that future groundwater withdrawal must be well managed in order to limit further salinization. groundwater withdrawal from the quaternary coastal aquifer must be below the natural average recharge in order to be sustainable."
Eissa et al.,2016,Journal of African Earth Sciences,"geophysical and geochemical studies to delineate seawater intrusion in bagoush area, northwestern coast, egypt","coastal aquifers are the main source for sustainable freshwater in many arid and semi arid regions around the earth. in such regions, groundwater extraction far exceeds the natural replenishment rates due to additional demands on groundwater resources especially in the last few decades. the characterization of the seawater intrusion in the baghoush area along the northwestern coast of egypt assesses the risk of seawater intrusion for the purpose of managing the groundwater resources in coastal areas. the (si) in the oolitic pleistocene aquifer is affected by several natural factors, including the drainage patterns, geological structures, distance from the sea and the manipulation of groundwater. electrical resistivity tomography (ert) has been implemented to identify the geometry of the brackish/saline water interface and to map the distribution of brackish water zone floating over the denser saline water. seven 2 d resistivity imaging profiles were conducted using a wenner array with different electrode distance spacings. the inverse resistivity models of these profiles indicate that these profiles are composed of three zones: the upper dry zone, the middle brackish water zone, and the lower saline water zone. the thickness of the brackish groundwater zone decreases toward the sea and the resistivity decreases with depth due to increase in water salinity. watertable along these profiles decreases from south to north, which indicates that groundwater flow is from south (inland) to north (sea). groundwater chemistry and stable isotopes were used to determine the fresh groundwater recharge source(s), to identify mixing of different groundwaters, to evaluate seawater intrusion zone along the coast, and to investigate the upwelling of deep saline groundwater underneath the brackish zone. the recharge of fresh groundwater originates from the mountain watershed located upstream as well as the annual rainfall; however, seawater is the main source of groundwater salinization. the estimated mixing ratios between the fresh groundwater recharge to seawater ranges between 32% and 75% groundwater to 68% and 25% seawater. the outcomes of this study emphasize the importance of closely monitoring groundwater management to limit upwelling of the underlying salt water into the overlying groundwater along the coast to limit further seawater intrusion.

El-Naqa et al.,2013,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,"groundwater resources assessment for irrigable agricultural lands in the wadi araba area, southern jordan","the main target of this research paper was to the hydrogeological assessment of the groundwater resources to irrigate 600 ha of irrigable agricultural lands, distributed along the dead sea aqaba highway in umm, methla, wadi musa, qa' saideen and rahma, southern jordan. therefore, a comprehensive groundwater study was commenced by drilling eight new wells which can be used to supply irrigable areas with the existing groundwater that would be enriched by the yield of three proposed recharge dams on wadi musa, wadi abu burqa, and wadi rahma. the evaluation of the pumping test data of the drilled was carried out using the standard methods of pumping test interpretation. this was based on the available watertable measurements at well locations and knowledge of water flow in the general. the sustainable yield of each well was calculated based on the pumping test parameters. the obtained results indicate that pumping out of beer mathkor wells should not exceed 1,100 m(3)/day in the case of continuous pumping and 8,700 m(3)/day in the case of intermittent pumping. since the watertable did not significantly change with small changes in pumping (it took eightfolds of magnitude increase in pumping from approximately 1,100 to 8,700 m(3)/day to show a significant drop in the watertable equivalent to about 5.5 mcm per year from the aquifer."
Elbeih et al.,2015,Ain Shams Engineering Journal,an overview of integrated remote sensing and gis for groundwater mapping in egypt,"groundwater is considered the major portion of the world's freshwater resources. one of the main challenges facing the sustainable development of egypt is the need for better management of its limited fresh water resources. groundwater exists in the nile valley, nile delta, western desert oases, and sinai peninsula. hydrogeological mapping of groundwater resources is one of the main tools for the controlled development of groundwater resources. remotely sensed surface indicators of groundwater provide useful data where practical classical alternatives are not available. integrated remote sensing and gis are widely used in groundwater mapping. locating potential groundwater targets is becoming more convenient, cost effective than invasive methods and efficient with the advent of a number of satellite imagery. the nature of remote sensing based groundwater exploration is to delineate all possible features connected with localization of groundwater. data, driven out of remote sensing, support decisions related to sustainable development and groundwater management.

Elfadaly et al.,2018,Surveys in Geophysics,management of cultural heritage sites using remote sensing indices and spatial analysis techniques,"sustainable management and exploitation policies as well as suitable conservation and mitigation strategies are mandatory to preserve cultural heritage and to reduce threats, weathering phenomena, and human actions that may produce significant deterioration and alteration of cultural heritage and its environment. in this context, remote sensing technologies can offer useful data to timely update information and documentation and set up reliable tools for systematic monitoring of cultural properties. in this study, multi temporal and multi sensor satellite data from corona, landsat, spot, quickbird, and sentinel 2a have been exploited along with spatial analysis to investigate the area of the theban temples at west luxor (egypt), severely threatened by uncontrolled urban sprawl. the results from our analyses showed that the urban expansion continuously occurred during the whole investigated period causing an increasing in urban areas around (1) 1.316km(2) from 1967 to 1984, (2) 1.705km(2) from 1984 to 2000, (3) 0.978km(2) from 2000 to 2003, (4) 2.314km(2) from 2003 to 2011, and (5) 1.377km(2) from 2011 to 2017. the random urban expansion caused bad sewage networks and high groundwater depth which in turn affected the archaeological areas directly (as evident on a landscape view) and indirectly by causing changes (growing) in the level of groundwater depth and increasing and accelerating weathering phenomena. the quantification and mapping of urban sprawl enabled us not only to quantify and spatially characterize urban sprawl but also to create a model to mitigate the impact and provide some operational recommendations to protect the archaeological site. outcomes from our analysis pointed out that today the tremendous availability of advanced remote sensing data has opened new prospectives unthinkable several years ago."

Eltarabily et al.,2017,Water Science and Technology-Water Supply,"modeling the impact of nitrate fertilizers on groundwater quality in the southern part of the nile delta, egypt","the use of fertilizers in agriculture in egypt, especially nitrogen, has increased significantly in the last decade, resulting in nonpoint contamination of the groundwater resources. this study investigated the effect of using nitrogen fertilizer on groundwater contamination with nitrate in the central southern part of the nile delta. no3  concentrations in shallow groundwater were assessed based on the applied urea dose (the common nitrogen fertilizer used) in year 2014. a groundwater modeling system (gms) comprising modflow and mt3d was used to simulate the threedimensional groundwater flow and no3  transportation processes in el menoufia governorate, located in the central region of the nile delta aquifer. calibration for modflow was conducted to match known head configurations to minimize the waterbalance differences. calibration of mt3d was accomplished by fitting the model to the measured no3  concentrations during the year 2014. the results highlighted areas of groundwater contamination by no3 , which occurred at shallow depths (40 m) due to the significant loads of nitrogen fertilizer application and the flood irrigation method. while the results suggested one approach was to avoid using contaminated shallow groundwater as a water source, a more sustainable approach would be to implement best management practices to reduce and control the amount of nitrate leaching into the shallow groundwater system in the future."
Eltarabily et al.,2018,Environmental Modeling & Assessment,"groundwater modeling in agricultural watershed under different recharge and discharge scenarios for quaternary aquifer eastern nile delta, egypt","different scenarios of recharge and discharge were assessed for sustainable management of groundwater in quaternary aquifer east of nile delta. modflow was utilized to investigate the effect of landuse change and damming construction in the upstream of the nile river on the current and short term groundwater management strategies. the interpretive transient simulation was performed between 2004 and 2016 after steady state calibration in 2004, and transient state from 2004 to 2013 with different irrigation recharges associated with landuse change in this period. sensitivityanalysis was performed for hydraulic conductivities, recharge, and conductance parameters. the predictive transient simulation was run till 2023 under three scenarios of increasing pumping rates by 15, 30, and 50% for agriculture expansion and specified head reduction of port said canal by 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m associated with the reduction of nile water levels after grand ethiopian residence dam, gerd operation in 2017. results from the in  and out flow budgets showed that groundwater aquifer is stable at the current rate of pumping till 2023. groundwater heads decreased by 0.2 and 0.42 m in the southern section, and a slight increase in the northern part was noticed for the first and second scenarios, respectively. when additional pumping stress is applied (50% increase), groundwater head dropped by 0.66 m, and the storage is no longer able to maintain the aquifer capacity after 2020 (worst case scenario)."
Elvan et al.,2014,Water Science and Technology,analysis of turkish groundwater legislation and policy regarding international principles and conventions,"water resources have shaped the destinies of societies and affected settlement choice of civilizations for centuries. demand for them is constantly increasing and this surge has become an important threat for water resources due to those excessive demands and variety of usage types; at the same time, balancing the protection and use of ground and surfacewaters has become more difficult. the progress in legal and corporate structures for water management has been too slow for a long time. in this study, principles of international conventions on groundwater are compared with the relevant turkish groundwater legislation, which is in the process of harmonization with european union (eu) acquis under the scope of turkey's nomination for eu membership. the purpose of this study is to measure the compliance of turkish legislation on groundwater with the relevant international principles and conventions, and also to analyze legal loopholes in turkish legislation in accordance with the international principles and conventions to be determined."
Encarnacao et al.,2015,Marine Ecology-an Evolutionary Perspective,local and temporal variations in near shore macrobenthic communities associated with submarine groundwater discharges,"the influence of submarine groundwater discharges (sgd) on the dynamics of coastal ecosystems is receiving increasing scientific attention, although our knowledge of this issue still remains insufficient. understanding the ecological response of coastal ecosystems to sgd dynamics is important in order to evaluate and predict changes in coastal communities. the aim of the present study was to characterize the effect of groundwater discharge on subtidal soft bottom macrofaunal assemblages in the south coast of portugal (algarve) at different times of the year and under different discharge regimes. sediment macrofauna was sampled twice per season in spring and summer 2011 in two locations: one under influence of sgd (olhos de agua) and one not under that influence (arrifes). the results showed that differences in community structure between locations occurred mainly during spring, when the magnitude of groundwater discharge was higher. several individual taxa were strongly associated with the sgd, particularly during spring: the polychaete families magelonidae and oweniidae; the isopod cyathura carinata; and the bivalves tellimya ferruginosa and tellina fabula. some of these taxa are already considered indicators of sgd, whereas others merit further investigation. the average similarity among samples was consistently larger in the location with sgd and the average similarity between the two locations was generally higher during spring, indicating that sgd promote stability in macrobenthic communities across time and space. sgd were also associated with higher values of chlorophyll a (chl a), fine sediments and total abundance of organisms (particularly suspension feeders). this suggests that differences between locations are associated with sgd and mediated by nutrient fluxes and sediment transport, or their interaction."
Enemark et al.,2019,Journal of Hydrology,hydrogeological conceptual model building and testing: a review,"hydrogeological conceptual models are collections of hypotheses describing the understanding of groundwater systems and they are considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in groundwater flow and transport modelling. a common method for characterizing the conceptual uncertainty is the multi model approach, where alternative plausible conceptual models are developed and evaluated. this review aims to give an overview of how multiple alternative models have been developed, tested and used for predictions in the multi model approach in international literature and to identify the remaining challenges. the review shows that only a few guidelines for developing the multiple conceptual models exist, and these are rarely followed. the challenge of generating a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive range of plausible models is yet to be solved. regarding conceptual model testing, the reviewed studies show that a challenge remains in finding data that is both suitable to discriminate between conceptual models and relevant to the model objective. we argue that there is a need for a systematic approach to conceptual model building where all aspects of conceptualization relevant to the study objective are covered. for each conceptual issue identified, alternative models representing hypotheses that are mutually exclusive should be defined. using a systematic, hypothesis based approach increases the transparency in the modelling workflow and therefore the confidence in the final model predictions, while also anticipating conceptual surprises. while the focus of this review is on hydro geological applications, the concepts and challenges concerning model building and testing are applicable to spatio temporal dynamical environmental systems models in general."
Engelhardt et al.,2013,Environmental Earth Sciences,surface and subsurface conceptual model of an arid environment with respect to mid  and late holocene climate changes,"the water demand in arid regions is commonly covered by groundwater resources that date back to more humid periods of the pleistocene and holocene. within the investigated arid part of se saudi arabia information about climate, groundwater levels, and pumping rates are only available for regions where groundwater extractions occur at present day. for the prediction of the impact of long term climate changes on groundwater resources an understanding of the hydrogeological and hydrological past and the development of the aquifers is necessary. therefore, all available information about hydrology and hydrogeology for the past 10,000 years bp were collected and compiled to a conceptual model of the aquifer development on the arabian peninsula since the last ice age. the climatic history was displayed by changes in precipitation, temperature and recharge during the mid s and late holocene. the hydrogeological development is described by groundwater ages, sea level fluctuations, movement of the coastline, and the development of sabkhas. the most sensitive parameter to describe the development of aquifer system is recharge. present day recharge was calculated with the hydrological model system hec hms accounting for current precipitation, temperature, wind, soil types, and geomorphology. with respect to changes in precipitation and temperature over the past 10,000 years the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater recharge was calculated using empirical equations valid for semi arid and arid settings. further inflow into the groundwater system results from surfacewater infiltration in wadi beds, while natural outflow from the groundwater system occurs by discharge to the gulf, evaporation from sabkhas, and spring discharge. backward predictions can be verified by sedimentological observations of palaeo river systems and lakes indicating that groundwater levels reached temporarily the surface under wetter climate conditions and c 14 groundwater ages displaying groundwater residence times."
Engelhardt et al.,2013,Environmental Earth Sciences,impact of preboreal to subatlantic shifts in climate on groundwater resources on the arabian peninsula,"a large scale numerical flow and transport model was developed for the central eastern arid part of the arabian peninsula. the model was applied to a region with freshwater resources dating back to more humid periods of the past, which are faced with overexploitation today. model inflow was based on infiltration around wadi beds and groundwater recharge. inflow was balanced by natural outflows, such as evaporation from sabkhas, spring discharge, and discharge to the sea. two models were developed: (1) a short term present day model to estimate effective model parameters, and (2) a long term model to study the development of the groundwater resources during the mid  and late holocene and the natural response of the groundwater system to changes in climate. hydraulic model parameters (hydraulic conductivity and specific storage) were assigned with respect to geological structures. hydraulic parameters were estimated with an inverse pest model by calibrating against observed depression cones cause by groundwater abstraction. sensitivityanalysis demonstrated that estimated model parameters were associated with a high uncertainty at a certain distance from agricultural areas when calibration data were lacking. a long term model starting 10,000 years bp was calibrated by spring discharge and palaeo groundwater levels and validated using measured c 14 groundwater ages. the long model predicted that groundwater levels adapted in response to changes in precipitation. during the mid holocene, which was characterized by an intensification of the monsoon season, groundwater levels increased by 10 m on the mainland within the shallow aquifers and adapted quickly to higher recharge rates. the deeper aquifers were less affected by changes in climate. along the present day coastline, the groundwater level rose by about 25 m due to the declined sea level in the mid holocene. during this period, surface run off was possible as groundwater levels temporarily reached the ground surface. the natural groundwaterbudget reacted sensitively to changes in climate. between 10 and 3 ka, groundwater storage occurred. during the late holocene, at 3 ka, natural depletion of the groundwater system began, which still prevails today."
Epting et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,development of concepts for the management of thermal resources in urban areas   assessment of transferability from the basel (switzerland) and zaragoza (spain) case studies,"the shallow subsurface in urban areas is increasingly used by shallow geothermal energy systems as a renewable energy resource and as a cheap cooling medium, e.g. for building air conditioning. in combination with further anthropogenic activities, this results in altered thermal regimes in the subsurface and the so called subsurface urban heat island effect. successful thermal management of urban groundwater resources requires understanding the relative contributions of the different thermal parameters and boundarycondition that result in the ""present thermal state"" of individual urban groundwater bodies. to evaluate the ""present thermal state"" of urban groundwater bodies, good quality data are required to characterize the hydraulic and thermal aquifer parameters. this process also involved adequate monitoring systems which provide consistent subsurface temperature measurements and are the basis for parameterizing numerical heat transport models. this study is based on previous work already published for two urban groundwater bodies in basel (ch) and zaragoza (es), where comprehensive monitoring networks (hydraulics and temperature) as well as calibrated high resolution numerical flow  and heat transport models have been analyzed. the ""present thermal state"" and how it developed according to the different hydraulic and thermal boundarycondition is compared to a ""potential natural state"" in order to assess the anthropogenic thermal changes that have already occurred in the urban groundwater bodies we investigated. this comparison allows us to describe the various processes concerning groundwater flow and thermal regimes for the different urban settings. furthermore, the results facilitate defining goals for specific aquifer regions, including future aquifer use and urbanization, as well as evaluating the thermal use potential for these regions. as one example for a more sustainable thermal use of subsurfacewater resources, we introduce the thermal management concept of the ""relaxation factor"", which is a first approach to overcome the present policy of ""first come, first served"". remediation measures to regenerate overheated urban aquifers are also introduced. the transferability of the applied methods to other urban areas is discussed. it is shown that an appropriate selection of locations for monitoring hydraulic and thermal boundarycondition make it possible to implement representative interpretations of groundwater flow and thermal regimes as well as to set up high resolution numerical flow  and heat transport models. those models are the basis for the sustainable management of thermal resources.

Eshtawi et al.,2015,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,potential impacts of urban area expansion on groundwater level in the gaza strip: a spatial temporal assessment,"in this study, a 3 d groundwater flow model was developed using modflow usg to investigate the groundwater levels within the gaza coastal aquifer. recharge estimation is based on a comprehensive approach including the connection to a surfacewater model (swat) for determining percolation from rainfall as well as detailed approaches regarding further recharge components. an unstructured grid (voronoi cells) generated by modflow usg engine was used to reduce run time within complicated aquifer boundarycondition. the results indicate a very good fit between measured and simulated heads. long term forecasting (2004 2030) of the groundwater levels was carried out as an essential step to support realistic and sustainable water resources planning and decision making. the increasing built up area was linked to the potential impacts of urban expansion relating to water supply quantities and groundwater recharge components. the percolation was reduced temporally and spatially in the forecasting period based on the projected built up area as well as an urban percolation index. considering the current management situation, the annual groundwater level correlated negatively with the increasing built up area; the regression line slope was  0.056 m/km(2) for the average groundwater levels while it became steeper at  0.23 m/km(2) in sensitive locations in the southern part of the gaza strip. the groundwater level trend index was developed as a spatial indicator for the appropriate management alternatives that can achieve less negative trend index."
Eshtawi et al.,2016,Water Research,integrated hydrologic modeling as a key for sustainable urban water resources planning,"in this study, a coupling of surfacewater (swat), groundwater (modflow) and solute transport (mt3dms) models was performed to quantify surface groundwater and quantity quality interactions under urban area expansion. the responses of groundwater level, nitrate concentrations (related to human activities) and chloride concentrations (related to seawater intrusion) to urban area expansion and corresponding changes in the urban waterbudget were examined on a macro scale level. the potentials of non conventional water resources scenarios, namely desalination, stormwater harvesting and treated wastewater (tww) reuse were investigated. in a novel analysis, groundwater improvement and deterioration under each scenario were defined in spatial temporal approach. the quality deterioration cycle index was estimated as the ratio between the amounts of low and high quality recharge components within the gaza strip boundary predicted for year 2030. the improvement index for groundwater level (iil) and the improvement index for groundwater quality (hq) were developed for the scenarios as measures of the effectiveness toward sustainable groundwater planning. even though the desalination and twin reuse scenarios reflect a noticeable improvement in the groundwater level, the desalination scenario shows a stronger tendency toward sustainable groundwater quality. the stormwater harvesting scenario shows a slight improvement in both groundwater quality and quantity. this study provides a 'corridor of options', which could facilitate future studies focusing on developing a micro level assessment of the above scenarios.

Esteban et al.,2012,Hydrogeology Journal,"the problem of sustainable groundwater management: the case of la mancha aquifers, spain","gisser and sanchez (water resour res 16(4):638 642, 1980) compared two different strategies to manage aquifers: ""free market"" and policy regulation. they stated that the outcome of both is practically the same, and that policy regulation could not improve social welfare. this study challenges this argument by analyzing the management strategies in two large aquifers located in southern spain, the eastern la mancha and the western la mancha aquifers. the appeal of this case stems from the fact that management of the eastern la mancha aquifer is almost sustainable. in stark contrast, its neighboring western la mancha aquifer is being grossly mismanaged. the results engage two major questions from previous groundwater literature. the first question is whether or not aquifer management requires policy intervention. the answer depends upon the consideration and magnitude of environmental damages in the model. the second question addresses the nature of groundwater policies. the contrast in management outcomes between the western and the eastern la mancha aquifers is related to the different types of policy instruments implemented for each aquifer. the results of these policies underline the importance of nurturing the stakeholders' collective action under the appropriate institutional setting."
Esteban et al.,2013,Journal of Environmental Management,modeling sustainable groundwater management: packaging and sequencing of policy interventions,"of the many studies estimating effectiveness of policy reforms most have been considering various types of policy reforms in isolation from each other. such pattern has also been the case in water resource regulations. in the case of groundwater almost all policy interventions considered in the literature have been implemented individually, without taking into account the possible interactions and impacts among them. in this paper, we focus on two policy instruments: water quota and uniform water tax. the paper demonstrates how packaging and sequencing sets of policy interventions, with possible triggers to initiate their time of implementation, may be more effective in achieving a sustainable groundwater management than single policies when environmental externalities exist. the policy instruments are applied to the western la mancha aquifer in southeast spain, a major aquifer that is managed by a command and control approach.

Ettayfi et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,"geochemical and isotopic (oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, strontium) constraints for the origin, salinity, and residence time of groundwater from a carbonate aquifer in the western anti atlas mountains, morocco","groundwater in many arid basins, particularly in developing countries, is the only available water resource that sustains local communities. yet, information on the basic hydrological parameters and the sustainability of the groundwater exploitation are often lacking. this study investigates the origin of groundwater from the lower cambrian carbonate aquifer of the lakhssas plateau in the anti atlas mountains of southwestern morocco. the study aims to reveal the origin of the groundwater, salinity sources, and the residence time of the water. the study is based on a comprehensive geochemical and isotopic (oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and strontium) investigation of groundwater from different parts of the basin. the hydrochemical and isotopes results indicated three types of groundwater in the lakhssas plateau: (1) thermal water in the southern part of the basin with solute composition that reflects dissolution of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate minerals; (2) low temperature groundwater at the southern margin of the basin with low salinity (chloride content up to 100 mg/l) and chemical composition that is expected from equilibrium with limestone dolomite rocks; and (3) low temperature groundwater in the northern, western, and eastern margins of the basin with a wide range of salinity (chloride up to 800 mg/l). the different water types had also different stable isotope composition; the thermal water was depleted in o 18 and h 2 (delta o 18 as low as  7.6 parts per thousand) relative to the southern ( 5.9 to  5.3 parts per thousand) and northern waters ( 5.7 to  3.8 parts per thousand). the differences in delta o 18 and delta h 2 between the southern and northern waters are related to elevation that induced fractionation of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in recharge water originated from coastal moisture. the data suggest that the high salinity in groundwater from the northern, western and eastern margins of the lakhssas plateau is related to the presence of schist rocks in these areas. the distinctive low na/cl arid br/cl ratios, coupled with high silica contents and high sr 87/sr 88 ratios (up to 0.713) in the saline groundwater provide additional evidences for the link between salinity and the schist rocks. in contrast, the thermal water had relatively low sr 87/sr 88 ratio (0.7089), which is identical to the secular seawater sr isotope ratio during the early cambrian period and presumably reflects interaction with the early cambrian carbonate and sulfate aquifer rocks. in the northern and southern groundwater, the sr 87/sr 88 ratios were higher and correlated with the mg/ca ratios, inferring mixing between the early cambrian limestone and other rocks with higher sr 87/sr 88, such as the schist rocks. the radiocarbon data showed c 14 activities ranging from 6 pmc in the thermal water to 62 pmc in the southern water. age modeling, corrected for dissolution of the carbonate rocks with dead carbon, simulated mean residence time of 10 15 ka bp for the thermal water and a range of 0 to 3 ka bp for the northern and southern waters, depending on the used models. the integration of the data enables us to establish a conceptual model for the origin of groundwater in the lakhssas plateau: (1) recharge to the aquifer from relatively heavy isotope depleted recharge water, presumably during wetter conditions about 10 15 ka bp. the recharge water interacted at high depth with limestone and calcium sulfate minerals and emerged to the surface as thermal water at the southern part of the basin; (2) more recent recharge from coastal moisture originated from the atlantic ocean. the stable isotope composition of groundwater was controlled by the elevation of their recharge areas: recharge at higher elevation, particularly in the southern margin resulted in lower delta o 18 and delta h 2 values; (3) the recharge water interacted with the carbonate aquifer rocks, particularly with calcite and dolomite minerals. in areas of exposure of schist rocks, the water rock interaction induced salinization of the groundwater. overall, our data reveal that the limited water resources in this semi arid zone of morocco could be in some parts less renewable and also saline. future exploitation of this basin will have to account the salinity factor and the suggested contribution of water recharged some thousands years ago.

Exposito et al.,2017,Sustainability,sustainability implications of deficit irrigation in a mature water economy: a case study in southern spain,"deficit irrigation (di) is an agricultural practice in which the volume of irrigation water applied during the crop cycle is below the irrigation requirements for maximum production, the aim of which is to increase irrigation water productivity. most research on this technique has focused on agronomic strategies while the economic and environmental consequences have received little attention. this study aims to shed some light on this matter and presents preliminary results regarding the implications of di with respect to the sustainable use of water resources. the analysis is based on the dpsir analytical framework (driving force/pressure/state/impact/response) and the microeconomics of di. the case study focuses on intensive olive groves in the guadalquivir river basin in southern spain (where olive cultivation accounts for 50% of the total irrigated area). the analysis shows that the widespread use of di practices, which is the farmers' response to a decreasing net water supply and falling farm incomes (driving force) in the context of a mature water economy, may help to break the dpsir chain of causality, provided that there are restrictions on any expansion in irrigated area. they can, thus, play a role in achieving sustainable water use. conversely, demand and supply (regulator) responses involving raising the price of water would lead to higher pressures on the resource and represent a negative driving force in our dpsir model."
Ezquerro et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,a quasi elastic aquifer deformational behavior: madrid aquifer case study,"the purpose of this paper is to analyze the quasi elastic deformational behavior that has been induced by groundwater withdrawal of the tertiary detrital aquifer of madrid (spain). the spatial and temporal evolution of ground surface displacement was estimated by processing two datasets of radar satellite images (sar) using persistent scatterer interferometry (psi). the first sar dataset was acquired between april 1992 and november 2000 by ers 1 and ers 2 satellites, and the second one by the envisat satellite between august 2002 and september 2010. the spatial distribution of psi measurements reveals that the magnitude of the displacement increases gradually towards the center of the well field area, where approximately 80 mm of maximum cumulated displacement is registered. the correlation analysis made between displacement and piezometric time series provides a correlation coefficient greater than 85% for all the wells. the elastic and inelastic components of measured displacements were separated, observing that the elastic component is, on average, more than 4 times the inelastic component for the studied period. moreover, the hysteresis loops on the stress strain plots indicate that the response is in the elastic range. these results demonstrate the quasi elastic behavior of the aquifer. during the aquifer recovery phase ground surface uplift almost recovers from the subsidence experienced during the preceding extraction phase. taking into account this unique aquifer system, a one dimensional elastic model was calibrated in the period 1997 2000. subsequently, the model was used to predict the ground surface movements during the period 1992 2010. modeled displacements were validated with psi displacement measurements, exhibiting an error of 13% on average, related with the inelastic component of deformation occurring as a long term trend in low permeability fine grained units. this result further demonstrates the quasi elastic deformational behavior of this unique aquifer system.

Fabbri et al.,2016,Environmental Science & Policy,does a change of irrigation technique impact on groundwater resources? a case study in northeastern italy,"the venetian plain is a densely populated area and one of the most economically competitive regions in europe. therefore, a sustainable management of the water resources has to be accomplished to preserve both the social and economic value of this area and the regional environment in accordance with the european water policy directives. this paper presents the analysis of hydrologic and hydrogeological waterbalances of the high alluvial plain (approximately 790 km(2)) highlighting some important peculiarities that could be crucial for the local water policy. by focusing on the importance of different waterbudget components, the obtained results indicate in the irrigation the most relevant component of the aquifer recharge. thus, the irrigation management policy of the land reclamation consortia strongly influences aquifer recharge. moreover, future scenarios (2071 2100) for the high venetian plain are performed taking into account the changes of climate and irrigation policy. the inflow of the aquifer suffers a decrease ranging from 18% in the scenario influenced by climate change to 28% in the scenario affected by both the variations. in particular, the irrigation recharge shows the highest reduction due to both an increase in evaporation, owing to an increase in the surface temperature, or the irrigation methods. therefore, the irrigation management policy adopted by the land reclamation consortia is a fundamental concern. changes from surface irrigation to spray or drip irrigation could strongly affect the aquifer recharge. the classical technique of surface irrigation is very useful in terms of aquifer recharge in comparison with drip or spray irrigation. however, it also requires a huge volume of water compared with the minimum desirable streamflow of a river and its management policy. currently in italy, the transition from conventional irrigation systems to water saving techniques is favored by the land reclamation consortia in response to european and italian directives. however, the possible reduction of the aquifer recharge could influence the actual social and economic condition of the venetian plain because the human and industrial water needs are mostly dependent by groundwater exploitation. therefore, water saving activities should be accompanied by appropriate corrective actions to reduce the environmental and social impact due to the decrease in aquifer recharge.

Fallah-Mehdipour et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrologic Engineering,genetic programming in groundwater modeling,"determination of watertable elevation corresponding to aquifer recharge or discharge is an important issue in sustainable groundwater management. this approach necessitates the application of numerical simulation models that may require substantial amounts of input data related to aquifer parameters and specifications, even for modeling only part of the aquifer, which makes the calculations expensive. moreover, comprehensive aquifer modeling is a time consuming and computationally intensive process. artificial intelligence tools can replace simulation models and decrease computational efforts by using input and output data sets without considering complex relations of the system to be modeled. this paper employs an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (anfis) and genetic programming (gp) as artificial intelligence tools to extract governing groundwater flow equations in ghaen and karaj aquifers in iran. for both aquifers, several input output data sets, for both training and testing data sets, are determined by using a developed numerical simulation model [iterative alternating direction implicit method (iadim)]. in addition, the watertable elevation at each cell in the model is considered to be a function of aquifer recharge and discharge at the current period as well as watertable elevation at the previous period. application of anfis and gp models in these case studies illustrates the superior flexibility of gp over anfis in time series modeling. in fact, gp provides watertable elevation results with less root mean squared error (rmse) as the error criterion, especially in the testing data set. thus, gp is a good candidate for use in groundwater modeling.

Fan et al.,2015,Water Resources Research,groundwater in the earth's critical zone: relevance to large scale patterns and processes,"although we have an intuitive understanding of the behavior and functions of groundwater in the earth's critical zone at the scales of a column (atmosphere plant soil bedrock), along a toposequence (ridge to valley), and across a small catchment (up to third order streams), this paper attempts to assess the relevance of groundwater to understanding large scale patterns and processes such as represented in global climate and earth system models. through observation syntheses and conceptual models, evidence are presented that groundwater influence is globally prevalent, it forms an environmental gradient not fully captured by the climate, and it can profoundly shape critical zone evolution at continental to global scales. four examples are used to illustrate these ideas: (1) groundwater as a water source for plants in rainless periods, (2) watertable depth as a driver of plant rooting depth, (3) the accessibility of groundwater as an ecological niche separator, and (4) groundwater as the lower boundary of land drainage and a global driver of wetlands. the implications to understanding past and future global environmental change are briefly discussed, as well as critical discipline, scale, and data gaps that must be bridged in order for us to translate what we learn in the field at column, hillslope and catchment scales, to what we must predict at regional, continental, and global scales."
Fan et al.,2011,Climate Dynamics,a simple hydrologic framework for simulating wetlands in climate and earth system models,"wetlands are ecosystems of important functions in the earth's climate system. through relatively high evapotranspiration, they affect surfacewater and energy exchange with the atmosphere directly influencing the physical climate. through ch4, co2 and n2o fluxes, they regulate the biogeochemical cycles, indirectly influencing the physical climate. however, current models do not explicitly include the watertable, present under all large and stable wetlands; model wetlands are identified as flat land with wet soil resulting from precipitation events. that is, the wetlands are only 'wetted' from above but not from below by the high watertable. furthermore, without the knowledge of the watertable position, estimates of ch4 and other gases (e.g., co2 and n2o) are poorly constrained. we present a simple hydrologic framework for simulating wetlands based on watertable depth. a synthesis of hydrologic controls on wetlands highlights the key role that groundwater plays. it directly feeds wetlands, supports surfacewater fed wetlands by maintaining a saturated substrate, and links land drainage to sea level by impeding drainage in lowlands. forced by routine climate model output (precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff), land topography, and sea level, we simulate the present day watertable in north america at the 1 km scale. we validate the simulation with watertable observations and compare regions of shallow watertable to mapped wetlands. our results show that the framework captures the salient features of wetland distribution and extent at regional and continental scales, a direct result of large scale groundwater convergence that nourishes the lowlands even in arid climates. the low requirement of forcing and computation make the framework easy to adopt in climate and earth system models for simulating wetland responses to climate and sea level change for the present, paleo reconstructions, and future projections."
Fan et al.,2015,Geofluids,digitalcrust   a 4d data system of material properties for transforming research on crustal fluid flow,"fluid circulation in the earth's crust plays an essential role in surface, near surface, and deep crustal processes. flow pathways are driven by hydraulic gradients but controlled by material permeability, which varies over many orders of magnitude and changes over time. although millions of measurements of crustal properties have been made, including geophysical imaging and borehole tests, this vast amount of data and information has not been integrated into a comprehensive knowledge system. a community data infrastructure is needed to improve data access, enable large scale synthetic analyses, and support representations of the subsurface in earth system models. here, we describe the motivation, vision, challenges, and an action plan for a community governed, four dimensional data system of the earth's crustal structure, composition, and material properties from the surface down to the brittle ductile transition. such a system must not only be sufficiently flexible to support inquiries in many different domains of earth science, but it must also be focused on characterizing the physical crustal properties of permeability and porosity, which have not yet been synthesized at a large scale. the digitalcrust is envisioned as an interactive virtual exploration laboratory where models can be calibrated with empirical data and alternative hypotheses can be tested at a range of spatial scales. it must also support a community process for compiling and harmonizing models into regional syntheses of crustal properties. sustained peer review from multiple disciplines will allow constant refinement in the ability of the system to inform science questions and societal challenges and to function as a dynamic library of our knowledge of earth's crust."
Fang et al.,2016,Water Research,life cycle assessment as development and decision support tool for wastewater resource recovery technology,"life cycle assessment (lca) has been increasingly used in the field of wastewater treatment where the focus has been to identify environmental trade offs of current technologies. in a novel approach, we use lca to support early stage research and development of a biochemical system for wastewater resource recovery. the freshwater and nutrient content of wastewater are recognized as potential valuable resources that can be recovered for beneficial reuse. both recovery and reuse are intended to address existing environmental concerns, for example, water scarcity and use of non renewable phosphorus. however, the resource recovery may come at the cost of unintended environmental impacts. one promising recovery system, referred to as trens, consists of an enhanced biological phosphorus removal and recovery system (ebp2r) connected to a photobioreactor. based on a simulation of a full scale nutrient and water recovery system in its potential operating environment, we assess the potential environmental impacts of such a system using the easetech model. in the simulation, recovered water and nutrients are used in scenarios of agricultural irrigation fertilization and aquifer recharge. in these scenarios, trens reduces global warming up to 15% and marine eutrophication impacts up to 9% compared to conventional treatment. this is due to the recovery and reuse of nutrient resources, primarily nitrogen. the key environmental concerns obtained through the lca are linked to increased human toxicity impacts from the chosen end use of wastewater recovery products. the toxicity impacts are from both heavy metals release associated with land application of recovered nutrients and production of alcl3, which is required for advanced wastewater treatment prior to aquifer recharge. perturbation analysis of the lca pinpointed nutrient substitution and heavy metals content of algae biofertilizer as critical areas for further research if the performance of nutrient recovery systems such as trens is to be better characterized. our study provides valuable feedback to the trens developers and identifies the importance of system expansion to include impacts outside the immediate nutrient recovery system itself. the study also show for the first time the successful evaluation of urban to agricultural water systems in easetech.

Faunt et al.,2016,Hydrogeology Journal,"water availability and land subsidence in the central valley, california, usa","the central valley in california (usa) covers about 52,000 km(2) and is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world. this agriculture relies heavily on surfacewater diversions and groundwater pumpage to meet irrigation water demand. because the valley is semi arid and surfacewater availability varies substantially, agriculture relies heavily on local groundwater. in the southern two thirds of the valley, the san joaquin valley, historic and recent groundwater pumpage has caused significant and extensive drawdowns, aquifer system compaction and subsidence. during recent drought periods (2007 2009 and 2012 present), groundwater pumping has increased owing to a combination of decreased surfacewater availability and landuse changes. declining groundwater levels, approaching or surpassing historical low levels, have caused accelerated and renewed compaction and subsidence that likely is mostly permanent. the subsidence has caused operational, maintenance, and construction design problems for water delivery and flood control canals in the san joaquin valley. planning for the effects of continued subsidence in the area is important for water agencies. as landuse, managed aquifer recharge, and surfacewater availability continue to vary, long term groundwater level and subsidence monitoring and modelling are critical to understanding the dynamics of historical and continued groundwater use resulting in additional water level and groundwater storage declines, and associated subsidence. modeling tools such as the central valley hydrologic model, can be used in the evaluation of management strategies to mitigate adverse impacts due to subsidence while also optimizing water availability. this knowledge will be critical for successful implementation of recent legislation aimed toward sustainable groundwater use."

Faysse et al.,2012,Irrigation and Drainage,convergent readings of groundwater governance? engaging exchanges between different research perspectives,"in the last 50 years, the study of groundwater governance has given rise to rich and differentiated analytical approaches. this article proposes an exchange between the main heuristic viewpoints, results and theses of three approaches which studied groundwater governance: the study of groundwater governance as collective action initiated by ostrom, the analysis made by shah on informal groundwater economies and the works of prakash, mukherji and birkenholtz drawing on political ecology. the aquifers on which each approach originally built its analysis played a key role in the design of analytical frameworks which, in the case of the first two approaches, were later applied to a much larger set of cases. the three approaches share many commonalities in their heuristic methods. however, they differ in the content of governance systems recommended to achieve sustainable groundwater use, and especially in the benefits of involving water users in the implementation of governance. therefore, they also differ on what should be the focus of academic analyses. it is thus of interest to organize joint readings of cases of groundwater governance and to discuss the contents of research programmes able to provide fruitful analyses of these cases, based on local specificities. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Fernald et al.,2015,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,linked hydrologic and social systems that support resilience of traditional irrigation communities,"southwestern us irrigated landscapes are facing upheaval due to water scarcity and landuse conversion associated with climate change, population growth, and changing economics. in the traditionally irrigated valleys of northern new mexico, these stresses, as well as instances of community longevity in the face of these stresses, are apparent. human systems have interacted with hydrologic processes over the last 400 years in river fed irrigated valleys to create linked systems. in this study, we ask if concurrent data from multiple disciplines could show that human adapted hydrologic and socioeconomic systems have created conditions for resilience. various types of resiliencies are evident in the communities. traditional local knowledge about the hydrosocial cycle of community water management and ability to adopt new water management practices is a key response to disturbances such as low water supply from drought. livestock producers have retained their irrigated land by adapting: changing from sheep to cattle and securing income from outside their livestock operations. labor intensive crops decreased as off farm employment opportunities became available. hydrologic resilience of the system can be affected by both human and natural elements. we find, for example, that there are multiple hydrologic benefits of traditional irrigation system water seepage: it recharges the groundwater that recharges rivers, supports threatened biodiversity by maintaining riparian vegetation, and ameliorates impacts of climate change by prolonging streamflow hydrographs. human decisions to transfer water out of agriculture or change irrigation management, as well as natural changes such as long term drought or climate change, can result in reduced seepage and the benefits it provides. we have worked with the communities to translate the multidisciplinary dimensions of these systems into a common language of causal loop diagrams, which form the basis for modeling future scenarios to identify thresholds and tipping points of sustainability. early indications are that these systems, though not immune to upheaval, have astonishing resilience."

Filimonau et al.,2016,Environmental Management,from global to local and vice versa: on the importance of the 'globalization' agenda in continental groundwater research and policy making,"groundwater is one of the most important environmental resources and its use continuously rises globally for industrial, agricultural, and drinking water supply purposes. because of its importance, more knowledge about the volume of usable groundwater is necessary to satisfy the global demand. due to the challenges in quantifying the volume of available global groundwater, studies which aim to assess its magnitude are limited in number. they are further restricted in scope and depth of analysis as, in most cases, they do not explain how the estimates of global groundwater resources have been obtained, what methods have been used to generate the figures and what levels of uncertainty exist. this article reviews the estimates of global groundwater resources. it finds that the level of uncertainty attached to existing numbers often exceeds 100 % and strives to establish the reasons for discrepancy. the outcome of this study outlines the need for a new agenda in water research with a more pronounced focus on groundwater. this new research agenda should aim at enhancing the quality and quantity of data provision on local and regional groundwater stocks and flows. this knowledge enhancement can serve as a basis to improve policy making on groundwater resources globally. research informed policies will facilitate more effective groundwater management practices to ensure a more rapid progress of the global water sector towards the goal of sustainability."

Flipo et al.,2014,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,continental hydrosystem modelling: the concept of nested stream aquifer interfaces,"coupled hydrological hydrogeological models, emphasising the importance of the stream aquifer interface, are more and more used in hydrological sciences for pluri disciplinary studies aiming at investigating environmental issues. based on an extensive literature review, stream aquifer interfaces are described at five different scales: local [10 cm similar to 10 m], intermediate [similar to 10 m similar to 1 km], watershed [10 km(2) similar to 1000 km(2)], regional [10 000 km(2) similar to 1 m km(2)] and continental scales [> 10 m km(2)]. this led us to develop the concept of nested stream aquifer interfaces, which extends the well known vision of nested groundwater pathways towards the surface, where the mixing of low frequency processes and high frequency processes coupled with the complexity of geomorphological features and heterogeneities creates hydrological spiralling. this conceptual framework allows the identification of a hierarchical order of the multi scale control factors of stream aquifer hydrological exchanges, from the larger scale to the finer scale. the hyporheic corridor, which couples the river to its 3 d hyporheic zone, is then identified as the key component for scaling hydrological processes occurring at the interface. the identification of the hyporheic corridor as the support of the hydrological processes scaling is an important step for the development of regional studies, which is one of the main concerns for water practitioners and resources managers. in a second part, the modelling of the stream aquifer interface at various scales is investigated with the help of the conductance model. although the usage of the temperature as a tracer of the flow is a robust method for the assessment of stream aquifer exchanges at the local scale, there is a crucial need to develop innovative methodologies for assessing stream aquifer exchanges at the regional scale. after formulating the conductance model at the regional and intermediate scales, we address this challenging issue with the development of an iterative modelling methodology, which ensures the consistency of stream aquifer exchanges between the intermediate and regional scales. finally, practical recommendations are provided for the study of the interface using the innovative methodology mim (measurements interpolation modelling), which is graphically developed, scaling in space the three pools of methods needed to fully understand stream aquifer interfaces at various scales. in the mim space, stream aquifer interfaces that can be studied by a given approach are localised. the efficiency of the method is demonstrated with two examples. the first one proposes an upscaling framework, structured around river reaches of similar to 10 100 m, from the local to the watershed scale. the second example highlights the usefulness of space borne data to improve the assessment of stream aquifer exchanges at the regional and continental scales. we conclude that further developments in modelling and field measurements have to be undertaken at the regional scale to enable a proper modelling of stream aquifer exchanges from the local to the continental scale."
Foglia et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,coupling a spatiotemporally distributed soil waterbudget with stream depletion functions to inform stakeholder driven management of groundwater dependent ecosystems,"groundwater pumping, even if only seasonal, may significantly impact groundwater dependent ecosystems through increased streamflow depletion, particularly in semiarid and arid regions. the effects are exacerbated, under some conditions, by climate change. in social sciences, the management of groundwater dependent ecosystems is generally considered a wicked problem due to the complexity of affected stakeholder groups, disconnected legal frameworks, and a divergence of policies and science at the cross road between groundwater and surfacewater, and between ecosystems and water quality. a range of often simplified scientific tools plays an important role in addressing such problems. here we develop a spatiotemporally distributed soil waterbudget model that we couple with an analytical model for stream depletion from groundwater pumping to rapidly assess seasonal impacts of groundwater pumping on streamflow during critical low flow periods. we demonstrate the applicability of the tool for the scott valley in northern california, where protected salmon depend on summer streamflow fed by cool groundwater. in this example, simulations suggest that increased recharge in the period immediately preceding the critical low streamflow season, and transfer of groundwater pumping away from the stream are potentially promising tools to address ecosystem concerns, albeit raising difficult infrastructure and water trading issues. in contrast, additional winter recharge at the expense of later spring recharge, whether intentional or driven by climate may reduce summer streamflows. comparison to existing detailed numerical groundwater model results suggests that the coupled soil water mass balancestream depletion function approach provides a viable tool for scenario development among stakeholders, to constructively inform the search for potential solutions, and to direct more detailed, complex site specific feasibility studies. the tool also identifies important field monitoring efforts needed to improve the understanding and quantification of site specific groundwater stream interactions."

Folch et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,"groundwater development effects on different scale hydrogeological systems using head, hydrochemical and isotopic data and implications for water resources management: the selva basin (ne spain)","hydrogeological resources in regional, large scale groundwater systems are conditioned by their specific geological setting, which defines their capacity to supply human demand and their potential to recover from human induced stress factors such as water withdrawal. in this paper, the hydrogeology of a range and basin hydrogeological system is described, based on potentiometric, hydrochemical and isotopic data, in order to fulfill a twofold objective: to characterize the alteration brought about in the hydrogeological system by intensive groundwater withdrawal, where tectonic elements such as fault zones play a significant role in the flow behaviour, and to define groundwater hydrodynamics under current human pressures as a necessary step to achieve appropriate groundwater management. hydraulic head data indicate the relationships between geological formations in the range areas and the sedimentary infill of the basin. in this set up, fault zones and a fracture network have a direct effect on the recharge, and allow upward vertical flow from the basement to the sedimentary aquifers. hydrochemical and isotopic data support this observation. the use of fluoride and nitrate as tracers for the contribution of deep and shallow flow systems provides a detailed portrait of the effects of pumping on the flow path distribution. isotopic data depict seasonal trends in the water captured by wells. in this connection, we can differentiate between two distinct flow systems: a regional, large scale, longer residence time system, originating in the surrounding ranges, and a local flow system constituted by infiltration in the lower areas of the basin. the two systems, with specific water qualities, contribute differently to the resources that are withdrawn, and their specific contributions, in the frame of the basin waterbudget, determine the potential for present sustainable water exploitation.

Foley et al.,2018,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science,karst channelled intertidal submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) conditions the form of the rock pool sessile assemblage,"freshwater submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) frequently occurs in areas of karst coastline where karst aquifers are hydraulically connected to the sea. though up to 25% of the world's coastline is karst, little work has been done to determine the ecological impacts of karst channelled freshwater sgd. reported herein are the effects of karst channelled freshwater sgd on the rock pool sessile assemblage in the locale of olhos de agua on the south portuguese coast. two quadrat surveys were conducted in eight intertidal rock pools, which ranged in freshwater sgd content from 0 to 57.3%. salinity and nitrogen (no3  and no2 ) concentrations were measured in the eight surveyed rock pools, as well as a further three rock pools on the same plateau, three inland groundwater boreholes and the adjacent coastal marine environment. there was a strong negative correlation between salinity (used as a proxy for freshwater sgd) and nitrogen concentration (r(2) = 0.98; p < 0.01), with rock pool nitrogen concentrations ranging from 15.3 mu m at salinity 36 (0% freshwater sgd) to similar to 515 mu m at salinity 4.27 (88% freshwater sgd). the concentration of nitrogen in the inland boreholes was elevated (similar to 258  similar to 450 mu m), though lower than that of the rock pool with the highest freshwater sgd content. freshwater sgd was associated with altered percentage cover of sessile organisms (p = 0.03), decreased organism cover (n.s.), and decreased species number (n.s). there was a negative correlation between freshwater sgd and the percentage cover of the coralline red algae ellisolandia elongata (r(2) = 0.811; t = 4.88; df = 8; p < 0.01). the most abundant algae, ulva spp., was found in all rock pools except the rock pool with the highest fraction of sgd. these results provide evidence for a direct influence of karst channelled freshwater sgd over the composition of the rock pool sessile assemblage. these results suggest a greater role of salinity than nitrogen additions in conditioning the form of the rock pool sessile assemblage."
Foong et al.,2018,Geologia Croatica,study of aqueous and non aqueous phase liquid in fractured double porosity soil using digital image processing,"the leakage and spillage of non aqueous phase liquids (napls) and aqueous phase liquids (apls) contribute to groundwater contamination, resulting in groundwater pollution and rendering the quality of groundwater unsafe for drinking and agriculture. ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all was the goal and target of the 2030 united nations agenda for sustainable development, consisting of a plan of action for the population, the planet and general prosperity. this paper is intended to investigate the aqueous and nonaqueous phase liquid migrations in a deformable double porosity soil, which has become important for both sustainable groundwater use and the comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of liquid migration into groundwater. a modelling experiment was conducted in an attempt to study the pattern and behaviour of aqueous and non aqueous phase liquid migration in fractured double porosity soil using a digital image processing technique. the results of the experiments show that the flow of the apl and napl migration was not uniformly downward. faster migration occurred where the soil surface was cracked compared to other locations where the soil surface was not cracked, even when liquids such as toluene were not used. it was concluded that the factors that significantly influenced the apl and napl migration were the structure of the soil sample, fracture pattern of the soil sample, physical interaction i.e. bonding between the liquid and soil sample, and the capillary pressure of the fluid. this study indicates that digital image analysis can provide detailed information to help researchers better understand and be able to simulate the pattern and characteristics of liquid migration that have an influence on groundwater resources."

Foster et al.,2015,Advances in Meteorology,groundwater surfacewater interactions in a mountain to coast watershed: effects of climate change and human stressors,"watersheds located within a mountain to coast physiographic setting have been described as having a highly interconnected surfacewater and groundwater environment. the quantification of groundwater surfacewater interactions at the watershed scale requires upscaling. this study uses mike she, a coupled numerical model, to explore the seasonally and spatially dynamic nature of these interactions in the cowichan watershed on vancouver island, british columbia, canada. the calibrated model simulates a transition of the cowichan river from mostly gaining within the valley, to losing stream near the coast where groundwater extraction is focused. losing and gaining sections correlate with geological substrate. recharge across the watershed accounts for 17% of precipitation. climate change is projected to lessen snowpack accumulation in the high alpine and alter timing of snowmelt, resulting in higher spring and winter river discharge and lower summer flows."

Foster et al.,2013,Water Science and Technology,irrigated agriculture and groundwater resources   towards an integrated vision and sustainable relationship,"globally, irrigated agriculture is the largest abstractor, and predominant consumer, of groundwater resources, with large groundwater dependent agro economies now having widely evolved especially in asia. such use is also causing resource depletion and degradation in more arid and drought prone regions. in addition crop cultivation practices on irrigated land exert a major influence on groundwater recharge. the interrelationship is such that cross sector action is required to agree more sustainable land and water management policies, and this paper presents an integrated vision of the challenges in this regard. it is recognised that 'institutional arrangements' are critical to the local implementation of management policies, although the focus here is limited to the conceptual understanding needed for formulation of an integrated policy and some practical interventions required to promote more sustainable groundwater irrigation."
Foster et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,analysis of the impacts of well yield and groundwater depth on irrigated agriculture,"previous research has found that irrigation water demand is relatively insensitive to water price, suggesting that increased pumping costs due to declining groundwater levels will have limited effects on agricultural water management practices. however, non linear changes in well yields as aquifer saturated thickness is reduced may have large impacts on irrigated production that are currently neglected in projections of the long term sustainability of groundwater fed irrigation. we conduct empirical analysis of observation data and numerical simulations for case studies in nebraska, usa, to compare the impacts of changes in well yield and groundwater depth on agricultural production. our findings suggest that declining well pumping capacities reduce irrigated production areas and profits significantly, whereas increased pumping costs reduce profits but have minimal impacts on the intensity of groundwater fed irrigation. we suggest, therefore, that management of the dynamic relationship between well yield and saturated thickness should be a core component of policies designed to enhance long term food security and support adaptation to climate change.

Fowler et al.,2015,Environmental Modelling & Software,a decision making framework with modflow fmp2 via optimization: determining trade offs in crop selection,"farmers in regions experiencing water stress or drought conditions can struggle to balance their crop portfolios. periods of low precipitation often lead to increased, unsustainable reliance on groundwater supplied irrigation. as a result, regional water management agencies place limits on the amount of water which can be obtained from groundwater, requiring farmers to reduce acreage for more water intensive crops or remove them from the portfolio entirely. real time decisions must be made by the farmer to ensure viability of their farming operation and reduce the impacts associated with limited water resources. evolutionary algorithms, coupled with accurate, flexible, realistic simulation tools, are ideal mechanisms to allow farmers to assess scenarios with regard to multiple, competing objectives. in order to effective, however, one must be able to select among a variety of simulation tools and optimization algorithms. many simulation tools allow no access to the source code, and many optimization algorithms are now packaged as part of a suite of tools available to a user. in this work, we describe a framework for integrating these different software components using only their associated input and output streams. we analyze our strategy by coupling a multi objective genetic algorithm available in the dakota optimization suite (developed and distributed by sandia national laboratory) with the modflow fmp2 simulation tool (developed and distributed by the united states geological survey). modflow fmp2 has been used extensively to model hydrological and farming processes in agriculture dciminated regions, allowing us to represent both farming and conservation interests. we evaluate our integration by considering a case study related to planting decisions facing farmers experiencing water stress. we present numerical results for three competing objectives associated with stakeholders in a given region (i.e., profitability, meeting demand targets, and water conservation). the data obtained from the optimization are robust with respect to algorithmic parameter choices, validating the ability of the associated evolutionary algorithm to perform well without expert guidance. this is integral to our approach, as a motivation for this work is providing decision making tools. in addition, the results from this study demonstrate that output from the chosen evolutionary algorithm provides a suite of feasible planting scenarios, giving farmers and policy makers the ability to compromise solutions based on realistic simulation data.

Frei et al.,2015,Water Resources Research,finiflux: an implicit finite element model for quantification of groundwater fluxes and hyporheic exchange in streams and rivers using radon,"a quantitative understanding of groundwater surfacewater interactions is vital for sustainable management of water quantity and quality. the noble gas radon 222 (rn) is becoming increasingly used as a sensitive tracer to quantify groundwater discharge to wetlands, lakes, and rivers: a development driven by technical and methodological advances in rn measurement. however, quantitative interpretation of these data is not trivial, and the methods used to date are based on the simplest solutions to the mass balance equation (e.g., first order finite difference and inversion). here we present a new implicit numerical model (finiflux) based on finite elements for quantifying groundwater discharge to streams and rivers using rn surveys at the reach scale (1 50 km). the model is coupled to a state of the art parameter optimization code parallel pest to iteratively solve the mass balance equation for groundwater discharge and hyporheic exchange. the major benefit of this model is that it is programed to be very simple to use, reduces non uniqueness, and provides numerically stable estimates of groundwater fluxes and hyporheic residence times from field data. finiflux was tested against an analytical solution and then implemented on two german rivers of differing magnitude, the salzach (similar to 112 m(3) s( 1)) and the rote main (similar to 4 m(3) s( 1)). we show that using previous inversion techniques numerical instability can lead to physically impossible negative values, whereas the new model provides stable positive values for all scenarios. we hope that by making finiflux freely available to the community that rn might find wider application in quantifying groundwater discharge to streams and rivers and thus assist in a combined management of surface and groundwater systems."
Freitas et al.,2019,Environmental Earth Sciences,"assessment of sustainability of groundwater in urban areas (porto, nw portugal): a gis mapping approach to evaluate vulnerability, infiltration and recharge","the urban water cycle concept demonstrates the connectivity and interdependence of urban water resources and human activities, and the need for integrated sustainable management studies and approaches. the role of climate, geology, geomorphology, landuse/cover, hydrogeochemistry, hydraulics, human activities among other features is significant in urban areas. in addition, landuse development has a stronger influence on terrestrial hydrology than climate variability. the need for provision of safe water, sanitation and drainage systems is key elements to consider for the groundwater resources in complex urban environments. in recent years, a new focus has emerged, addressing issues on integrated gis mapping studies on urban water supply systems, particularly in historical cities. to illustrate that approach the porto urban area (nw portugal) was selected. this work presents a comprehensive study to demonstrate the key importance of urban groundwater studies, as well as the evaluation of the urban infiltration potential index and the potential groundwater yields that might be available for non potable uses, such as irrigation of parks and lawns, street cleaning and firefighting. this strategy is useful for the planning and management of urban groundwater abstraction in an equitable and sustainable manner."
Frija et al.,2014,Water Policy,a critical assessment of groundwater governance in tunisia,"more than 40% of irrigation water currently used in tunisia is provided by groundwater aquifers, most of which are in a critical state of depletion due to its overexploitation during the last three decades. this paper provides a critical assessment of groundwater management in tunisia based on interviews with key officials from central and regional administrations, in addition to farmers' questionnaires regarding attitudes and perceptions about different groundwater management instruments. even though there is a consistent official groundwater management strategy in tunisia, its enforcement is still problematic. many regulatory and incentive instruments were adopted to manage groundwater but their effect was limited, partly due to the weak implementation capacities of the regional and local water administrations. moreover, most farmers are not aware about the critical situation of this common pool resource and self regulation initiatives are almost absent. from this assessment, we mainly conclude that the remaining activities for enhancing groundwater governance in tunisia needs to rely on two main axes. the first is related to the improvement of administrative performances, particularly those for horizontal coordination of groundwater. the second is about investing in enhancing social capital supporting institutional changes; which is particularly necessary for the promotion of self regulation initiatives."
Fry et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,climate change and development impacts on the sustainability of spring fed water supply systems in the alto beni region of bolivia,"in the alto beni region of bolivia, as in other locations of the developing world, gravity fed water supply systems provide a significant portion of domestic water needs. however, sustainability of these sources depends on whether discharge can be sustained to accommodate future water needs. there is a perception that agricultural expansion in the region is resulting in reduced spring discharge. to investigate this claim, we incorporate low cost field methods for hydrologic data collection and evaluate two satellite derived precipitation data products (cmorph and trmm 3b42) for input to a hydrological model used to predict recharge rates in eleven watersheds under scenarios of climate change and agricultural expansion. the stressors on the local water supply examined in this study are changes in landuse and climate, along with increases in population and consumption, and improvements in water and sanitation coverage. although predicted changes in runoff range from  69% to +137%, depending on the climate and landuse scenario, recharge is predicted to decrease under all scenarios (by 28% to nearly 100%) between the periods of 1970 1999 and 2070 2099. the predicted impacts from climate change are considerably larger than those from agricultural expansion, calling into question local perceptions that spring flow has declined because of changes in landuse from agricultural growth. the ratio of water use to availability under most scenarios of climate change and water and sanitation service expansion suggests that use of groundwater is sustainable in the region when considering the entire recharge to the watersheds. however, the small recharge areas of the springs may result in insufficient recharge to support planned water and sanitation expansion unless new water supplies are developed.

Fu et al.,2019,Journal of Hydrology,attributing variations of temporal and spatial groundwater recharge: a statistical analysis of climatic and non climatic factors,"this paper demonstrated the benefits of statistical methods when investigating the climatic and non climatic drivers responsible for variations in groundwater recharge with a series of up to 43 years of annual recharge for 426 bores in south east south australia. we identified the factors influencing groundwater recharge based on 71 climatic metrics and 17 non climatic metrics (including groundwater abstraction). the results showed: (1) rainfall during april to october was the most important variable influencing recharge temporal variation, with its decline identified as the most significant factor related to recharge reduction; (2) in contrast, a negative correlation between rainfall during december to february (djf) and annual groundwater recharge was found. this suggests that a seasonal shift in rainfall (such as decreasing rainfall during april to october and an increase during djf) can result in a decline in recharge even when the annual rainfall remains unchanged; (3) the length of wet spells (consecutive rain days) and increasing potential evapotranspiration (pet) were additional significant predictors for recharge temporal variation. it demonstrated that a simple empirical relationship (such as recharge as a fixed percentage of rainfall) is not a reliable estimation of renewable groundwater resources under changing climatic conditions; (4) there is a statistically significant correlation between mean groundwater depth and recharge, which implies that if groundwater level fall due to rainfall declines then a positive feedback loop can lead to further recharge declines; (5) spatially the most statistically significant factors influencing groundwater recharge were soil types and land attributes. the findings of this study can identify which stressors should be included when investigating the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge."
Fu et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,an interval parameter conditional value at risk two stage stochastic programming model for sustainable regional water allocation under different representative concentration pathways scenarios,"the shortage of water resources and the increasing competition among water users have highlighted the importance of the water allocation problem. water availability is crucial for water resource allocation and changes frequently, leading to the necessity to predict available water. this paper develops a framework aimed to plan regional water allocations under different representative concentration pathways (rcp) scenarios using an interval parameter conditional value at risk (cvar) two stage stochastic programming model. this framework combines prediction and optimization to reflect climate change, the uncertainty of water system and the coordination between water resources allocation and risk. the feasibility and practicality of the framework are demonstrated by its application in a real world case study in the lower songhua river basin in northeast china. comparison between the results of the developed model and actual conditions show that 11.61 x 10(8) m(3) volume of water supply can be saved after optimization, indicating that the developed model tends to allocate water in a more efficient way. the ratio of surfacewater to groundwater is reduced from 2:1 to 1.62:1. the proposed model has practical relevance for saving water and alleviating groundwater overexploitation. the approach is applicable to most areas with severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation, and decision makers can determine the appropriate options for water resources allocation based on risk preferences and actual conditions."
Fuchs et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,quantifying groundwater resilience through conjunctive use for irrigated agriculture in a constrained aquifer system,"the rincon valley in arid, south central new mexico, is especially impacted by reduced surfacewater supply because the contribution of groundwater is limited by aquifer constraints. consecutive surfacewater allotment shortages in the elephant butte irrigation district (ebid) have reduced recharge. the effects are compounded by farmers continuing to extract groundwater to meet crop requirements. conjunctive use assumes aquifer resilience (i.e., ability to absorb pumping stress), but not necessarily in drought. this study further develops the watertable fluctuation method by analyzing data from the ebid's groundwater monitoring program to reveal conjunctive use controls over the spatial and interannual variability of net storage changes from 2009 to 2016 in the valley and introduces the term groundwater surfacewater ratio of application (gsra), that has potential for characterizing system resilience in conjunctive use settings. regression modeling shows that variation in the annual ebid surfacewater allotment correlates strongly with year end watertable elevations, even more strongly than total annual groundwater extractions for irrigation, suggesting that variable surfacewater allotments are a primary driver of this system. dewatering of the aquifer as of 2011 significantly altered the system hydrology such that from 2011 to 2016, net change in storage correlates strongly with the annual surfacewater allotment, corresponding to large river losses for the same period, but resulting in net gains in storage from 2014 to 2016. rapid storage loss and rebound in this constrained aquifer system allowed quantification of aquifer resilience, enabling the development of a gsra as a potential planning metric."
Gagne et al.,2018,Canadian Water Resources Journal,"benefits and limitations of using isotope derived groundwater travel times and major ion chemistry to validate a regional groundwater flow model: example from the centre du quebec region, canada","understanding groundwater dynamics at the regional scale (> 100km) is essential to the development of sustainable water management regulations. groundwater flow models are increasingly used to support these strategies. however, in order to be reliable, these models need to be calibrated and validated. the objective of this work is to evaluate the benefits and the limitations of using isotope derived groundwater travel times and major ion chemistry to validate a regional scale groundwater flow model in the humid continental climate of southern quebec (canada). a three dimensional regional scale steady state groundwater model was created using modflow for the fractured bedrock aquifer of the centre du quebec region (quebec, canada), using data acquired during recent aquifer characterization projects. the model covers an area of 7452 km(2), from the unconfined appalachian mountains to the confined st. lawrence platform. groundwater travel times were simulated for 211 wells using particle tracking. the groundwater flow model was calibrated using 11,775 regionally distributed heads and 15 baseflow values. the model was validated using 23 h 3/he 3 residence time (3 to 60 years), 17 c 14 residence time (226 to 22,600 years), and the major ion compositions from 211 wells. results indicate that the model is able to satisfactorily simulate h 3/he 3 isotopic residence time, while c 14 isotopic residence times are generally underestimated. these results suggest substantial mixing between groundwater recharged during the last deglaciation and recently recharged water. regional groundwater flow is limited or absent, and most of the recharge discharges to the river network as baseflow. the analysis of travel times indicates a statistically distinct mean travel time for the different groundwater types. median travel time is 68 years for recently recharged groundwater (ca hco3), 274years for semi confined groundwater (na hco3), and 738 years for confined groundwater (na cl). this confirms that groundwater chemistry is a broad indicator of groundwater travel time."
Galindo-Castillo et al.,2017,Environmental Earth Sciences,"modeling the groundwater response to megacity expansion demand and climate change. case study: the cuautitlan pachuca aquifer, in the northeast of mexico city","aquifers are being threatened by overuse, and scenario predictions are convenient to design appropriate planning programs to water management. numerical modeling is a helpful tool in these analyses, but it is hard to manage with limited data available, which is frequent in developing countries. the aim of the paper is to show that there are other simple and reliable options. the primary objective of this research is to propose and validate a simplified to available data approach, useful for aquifer modeling, followed by scenarios' simulation, based on realistic future events. the mexican overexploited aquifer cuautitlan pachuca case study assess the responses of the water level under different outflows and infiltration scenarios from 2007 (base year) to 2031. modflow software allowed the model calibration with 2007 data, and further spatial and temporal evolution of the piezometric level. the aquifer is the main water supplier for economic activities, and population in the northern region of mexico city and outflows are continuously increasing, despite its severe overexploitation and even stronger negative impacts in the decline water levels are predicted in this study. a previous study reported  194.97 hm(3)/year deficit in 2010, and this paper predicts the strongest effect due to over pumping caused by the population growth that would intensify the deficiency up to  236.29 hm(3)/year. the results have revealed to decision makers the urgency to prevent the aquifer's irreversible impairment, with a proper operation and management planning. this paper provides a contribution for simplifying conceptual models allowing to predict aquifers' outcome scenarios with limited data."
Galloway et al.,2011,Hydrogeology Journal,review: regional land subsidence accompanying groundwater extraction,"the extraction of groundwater can generate land subsidence by causing the compaction of susceptible aquifer systems, typically unconsolidated alluvial or basin fill aquifer systems comprising aquifers and aquitards. various ground based and remotely sensed methods are used to measure and map subsidence. many areas of subsidence caused by groundwater pumping have been identified and monitored, and corrective measures to slow or halt subsidence have been devised. two principal means are used to mitigate subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal reduction of groundwater withdrawal, and artificial recharge. analysis and simulation of aquifer system compaction follow from the basic relations between head, stress, compressibility, and groundwater flow and are addressed primarily using two approaches one based on conventional groundwater flow theory and one based on linear poroelasticity theory. research and development to improve the assessment and analysis of aquifer system compaction, the accompanying subsidence and potential ground ruptures are needed in the topic areas of the hydromechanical behavior of aquitards, the role of horizontal deformation, the application of differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry, and the regional scale simulation of coupled groundwater flow and aquifer system deformation to support resource management and hazard mitigation measures."
Ganot et al.,2018,Water Resources Research,geochemical processes during managed aquifer recharge with desalinated seawater,"we study geochemical processes along the variably saturated zone during managed aquifer recharge (mar) with reverse osmosis desalinated seawater (dsw). the dsw, post treated at the desalination plant by calcite dissolution (remineralization) to meet the israeli water quality standards, is recharged into the israeli coastal aquifer through an infiltration pond. water quality monitoring during two mar events using suction cups and wells inside the pond indicates that cation exchange is the dominant subsurface reaction, driven by the high ca2+ concentration in the post treated dsw. stable isotope analysis shows that the shallow groundwater composition is similar to the recharged dsw, except for enrichment of mg2+, na+, ca2+, and hco3. a calibrated variably saturated reactive transport model is used to predict the geochemical evolution during 50 years of mar for two water quality scenarios: (i) post treated dsw (current practice) and (ii) soft dsw (lacking the remineralization post treatment process). the latter scenario was aimed to test soil aquifer treatment (sat) as an alternative post treatment technique. both scenarios provide an enrichment of similar to 2.5 mg l 1 in mg2+ due to cation exchange, compared to practically zero mg2+ currently found in the israeli dsw. simulations of the alternative sat scenario provide ca2+ and hco3 remineralization due to calcite dissolution at levels that meet the israeli standard for dsw. the simulated calcite content reduction in the sediments below the infiltration pond after 50 years of mar was low (<1%). our findings suggest that remineralization using sat for dsw is a potentially sustainable practice at mar sites overlying calcareous sandy aquifers."
Gao et al.,2013,Journal of Hydrology,opportunity for pen urban perth groundwater trade,"groundwater trade is widely advocated for reallocating scarce groundwater resources between competing users, and managing over allocated and declining aquifers. however, groundwater markets are still in their infancy, and the potential benefits and opportunities need investigation, particularly where there is a need to reduce the extraction from declining aquifers. this article evaluates economic impacts of reducing groundwater extraction for irrigation use in peri urban perth, australia, where irrigation, a lake based ecosystem, and public water supply are highly dependent on a declining groundwater resource. we present an assessment of market based water trading approaches to reduce groundwater extraction with an economic model representing diversity in returns to groundwater use across a population of irrigators. the results indicate that potential economic costs of a proportional reduction in available groundwater for irrigation are 18 21% less if groundwater trade is possible. we also evaluate a water buyback from irrigation to provide public water supply as an alternative to new infrastructure. we find that buying back up to around 50% of current irrigation allocations could create new public water supply only at the cost of $0.32 0.39 million per gl, which is less than one fifth of the costs of new desalinisation or recycled water supply options ($2 3 million per gl). we conclude that, with rapid development of computer and internet based trading platforms that allows fast, efficient and low cost multiple party trading, it is increasingly feasible to realise the economic potentials of market based trade approaches for managing overexploited aquifers.

Gao et al.,2015,Environmental Earth Sciences,soil salt and groundwater change in flood irrigation field and uncultivated land: a case study based on 4 year field observations,"salt transport in soil profile and shallow groundwater changes are significant seasonal response to flood irrigation in arid area. understanding soil salt and groundwater level change is useful to determine irrigation schedule and agricultural development. in this study, based on observation data at six fixed sites from 2007 to 2010, soil salt and groundwater depths change were investigated in irrigation fields and uncultivated lands of upper, middle and lower reaches in the arid irrigation district of hetao irrigation district. the results indicated that the fluctuation of soil salinity in each layer in irrigation fields was more frequent, while the soil salinity in uncultivated lands presented a surface accumulation phenomenon. the groundwater level had similar trends in 4 years and the groundwater changed gradually deeper from upstream to downstream. meanwhile, relationships between soil surface salinity and groundwater depth were various for irrigation field and uncultivated land. furthermore, the groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration were calculated with watertable fluctuation method. in all the crop growth periods, the influence of groundwater recharge on evapotranspiration was significant. for the irrigation fields, the mean contributions of groundwater to evapotranspiration of 4 years in upper, middle and lower reaches were 25.57, 11.96 and 15.23 %, respectively, while the values were 53.92, 21.61 and 36.84 % at the uncultivated land, respectively. the results can contribute to determine the water resources management plan for sustainable development of the irrigation district with shallow groundwater."
Garamhegyi et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,investigation of the climate driven periodicity of shallow groundwater level fluctuations in a central eastern european agricultural region,"the distribution and amount of groundwater, a crucial source of earth's drinking and irrigation water, is changing due to climate change effects. therefore, it is important to understand groundwater behavior in extreme scenarios, e.g. drought. shallow groundwater (sgw) level fluctuation under natural conditions displays periodic behavior, i.e. seasonal variation. thus, the study aims to investigate (1) the periodic behavior of the sgw level time series of an agriculturally important and drought sensitive region in central eastern europe   the carpathian basin, in the north eastern part of the great hungarian plain, and (2) its relationship to the european atmospheric pressure action centers. data from 216 sgw wells were studied using wavelet spectrum analysis and wavelet coherence analyses for 1961 2010. locally, a clear relationship exists between the absence of annual periodic behavior in the sgw level and the periodicity of droughts, as indicated by the self calibrating palmer drought severity index and the aridity index. during the non periodic intervals, significant drops in groundwater levels (average 0.5 m) were recorded in 89% of the wells. this result links the meteorological variables to the periodic behavior of sgw, and consequently, drought. on a regional scale, mediterranean cyclones from the gulf of genoa (northwest italy) were found to be a driving factor in the 8 yr periodic behavior of the sgw wells. the research documents an important link between sgw levels and local/regional climate variables or indices, thereby facilitating the necessary adaptation strategies on national and/or regional scales, as these must take into account the predictions of drought related climatic conditions."
Gardner et al.,2011,Water Resources Research,using terrigenic he 4 to identify and quantify regional groundwater discharge to streams,"we present a new technique for identifying and quantifying the discharge of long residence time, regional groundwater to rivers using naturally occurring tracers measured within the river. terrigenic he 4 and rn 222, synoptically sampled along a 100 km reach in the fitzroy river in northern western australia, are used to identify areas of groundwater inflow to the river and to distinguish shallow, local and deep, regional groundwater. models of tracer transport in the river can be numerically optimized to calculate total groundwater discharge and to separate regional and local discharge fractions. discharge of regional groundwater composes close to 15% of the total groundwater discharge along the entire reach, varying spatially along the reach from 0% to 100% of total groundwater discharge. this method should be applicable in river systems where groundwater with elevated terrigenic helium could be discharging to the river. the ability to separate locally from regionally derived groundwater discharge has significant implications for calculating catchment waterbudgets, for predicting catchment response to changes in precipitation, and for sustainable management of the catchment."
Garfias et al.,2018,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,assessment of vulnerability and control measures to protect the salbarua ecosystem from hypothetical spill sites,"population pressure, urbanization, and industrial developments, among other factors, have resulted in severe degradation of environmental resources such as wetlands. thus, a groundwater model (modflow) was integrated with a particle tracking modpath model to simulate the hydrodynamic flow head field and to analyze the vulnerability of the salburua ecosystem and propose control measures to protect the riparian area. the simulations show that pathways of particle tracking originating at potential contaminant sources will tend to migrate downwards towards the sensitive ecosystem, which suggests that the quality of the hydrological ecosystem is likely to deteriorate in the future. variation in exit points of particles indicates that the time related capture areas are affected by changes of the hydraulic gradients. two control measures of potential sources of pollutants in the vicinity of the salbarua ecosystem were analyzed. the study results suggest that the travel time related capture zone with a funnel and gate system is much smaller than without the control alternative, which indicates that the gate configuration has an effect on capture zone size and shape and on the residence time with a better attenuation performance. it is also shown that a leakage proof barrier is less effective for point source containment, assuming that hydraulic control performance and cost efficiency are the criteria for pollution control effectiveness. instead, a program of monitoring wells would effectively characterize water quality in the aquifer and provide a decision support system. this approach may be used in helping water managers to develop more physically based and quantitative protection strategies."
Garg et al.,2013,Ground Water,opportunities to build groundwater resilience in the semi arid tropics,"agricultural water management (awm) is the adaptation strategy for increasing agricultural production through enhancing water resources availability while maintaining ecosystem services. this study characterizes groundwater hydrology in the kothapally agricultural watershed, in hard rock deccan plateau area in india and assesses the impact of awm interventions on groundwater recharge using a calibrated and validated hydrological model, swat, in combination with observed watertable data in 62 geo referenced open wells. kothapally receives, on average, 750 mm rainfall (nearly 90% of annual rainfall) during the monsoon season (june to october). waterbalance showed that 72% of total rainfall was converted as evapotranspiration (et), 16% was stored in aquifer, and 8% exported as runoff from the watershed boundary with awm interventions. nearly 60% of the runoff harvested by awm interventions recharged shallow aquifers and rest of the 40% increased et. water harvesting structures (whs) contributed 2.5 m additional head in open wells, whereas hydraulic head under natural condition was 3.5 m, resulting in total 6 m rise in watertable during the monsoon. at the field scale, whss recharged open wells at a 200 to 400 m spatial scale."

Gilfedder et al.,2012,Environmental Modelling & Software,incorporating landuse changes and surface groundwater interactions in a simple catchment water yield model,"pressure on limited water resources and the environment requires better understanding of how landscape change impacts river flow. rainfall runoff models have traditionally focused on estimating total river flows with less emphasis on modelling the groundwater component or the consequences of different landuse change scenarios. in this paper, we present the gwlag model, a water generation model that predicts river flows with explicit accounting of the impacts of catchment landuse change and surface groundwater interactions. the paper firstly describes the theory that underpins the model and its calibration then presents a case study application in the tarcutta creek catchment of the murray darling basin, australia. the case study aims at: (i) demonstrating the ability of the model to predict daily river flows; (ii) modelling the impacts of hypothetical plantation forestry expansions on river flows; and (iii) showing the impacts of reduced recharge on the low flow regime using three indices, namely, q(90)/q(50) (where q(n) refers to nth percentile flow), slope of low flow part of flow duration curve, and % of zero flow days. results showed that predicted flows agreed favourably to those observed at the gauge especially during low flow conditions. the hypothetical plantation expansion from 32% to 87% of the catchment area has resulted in reductions of 48% and 32%, in q(50) and q(20), respectively. the low flow indices demonstrated the great sensitivity of low flow to reductions in recharge with the trend of the low flow response changing to non linear for recharge reductions beyond 10%. gwlag daily river flow predictions compared favourably to those obtained from four other rainfall runoff models in terms of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency (e). however, gwlag produced the highest e value for log transformed flows thus highlighting the model's superior predictive capability during low flow conditions. crown copyright (c) 2012 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."
Gill et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,"irrigator responses to groundwater resource management in northern victoria, southeastern australia","in northern victoria, farmers are the biggest users of groundwater and therefore the main stakeholders in plans that seek to sustainably manage the resource. interviews with 30 irrigation farmers in two study areas, analysed using qualitative social research methods, showed that the overwhelming majority of groundwater users agreed with the need for groundwater management and thought that the current plans had achieved sustainable resource use. the farmers also expressed a strong need for clear technical explanations for management decisions, in particular easily understood water level data. the social licence to implement the management plans arose through effective consultation with the community during plan development. several additional factors combined to gain acceptance for the plans: good data on groundwater usage and aquifer levels is available; irrigation farmers had been exposed to usage restrictions since the late 1990s; an 'adaptive' management approach is in use which allowed refinements to be readily incorporated and fortuitously, plan development coincided with the 1998 2009 drought, when declines in groundwater levels reinforced the usefulness of the plans. the imposition of a nation wide water use reduction plan in 2012 had relatively little impact in victoria because of the early implementation of effective groundwater management plans. however, economic difficulties that reduce groundwater users' capacity to pay groundwater management charges mean that the future of the plans in victoria is not assured. nevertheless, the high level of trust that exists between victorian irrigation farmers and the management agencies suggests that the continued use of a consultative approach will continue to produce workable outcomes. lessons from the victorian experience may be difficult to apply in other areas of groundwater use in australia and overseas, where there may be a quite different history of development and culture of groundwater management.

Gill et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,"economic, social and resource management factors influencing groundwater trade: evidence from victoria, australia","in victoria, australia, most groundwater resources are now fully allocated and opportunities for new groundwater development can only occur through trading of license entitlements. groundwater usage has rarely exceeded 50% of the available licensed volume, even in the 2008/9 drought year, and 50 to 70% of individual license holders use less than 5% of their allocation each year. however, little groundwater trading is occurring at present. interviews were conducted with groundwater license holders and water brokers to investigate why the victorian groundwater trade market is underdeveloped. responses show there is a complex mix of social, economic, institutional and technical reasons. barriers to trade are influenced by the circumstances of each groundwater user, administrative process and resource management rules. water brokers deal with few trades at low margins and noted unrealistic selling prices and administrative difficulties. irrigators who have successfully traded identify that there are few participants in trading, technical appraisals are expensive and administrative requirements and fees are burdensome, especially when compared to surfacewater trading. opportunities to facilitate trade include groundwater management plan refinement and improved information provision. simplifying transaction processes and costs, demonstrating good resource stewardship and preventing third party impacts from trade could address some concerns raised by market participants. there are, however, numerous individual circumstances that inhibit groundwater trading, so it is unlikely that policy and process changes alone could increase usage rates without greater demand for groundwater or more favourable farming economic circumstances.

Gleeson et al.,2012,Nature,waterbalance of global aquifers revealed by groundwater footprint,"groundwater is a life sustaining resource that supplies water to billions of people, plays a central part in irrigated agriculture and influences the health of many ecosystems(1,2). most assessments of global water resources have focused on surfacewater(3 6), but unsustainable depletion of groundwater has recently been documented on both regional(7,8) and global scales(9 11). it remains unclear how the rate of global groundwater depletion compares to the rate of natural renewal and the supply needed to support ecosystems. here we define the groundwater footprint (the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater dependent ecosystem services) and show that humans are overexploiting groundwater in many large aquifers that are critical to agriculture, especially in asia and north america. we estimate that the size of the global groundwater footprint is currently about 3.5 times the actual area of aquifers and that about 1.7 billion people live in areas where groundwater resources and/or groundwater dependent ecosystems are under threat. that said, 80 per cent of aquifers have a groundwater footprint that is less than their area, meaning that the net global value is driven by a few heavily overexploited aquifers. the groundwater footprint is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the use, renewal and ecosystem requirements of groundwater at an aquifer scale. it can be combined with the water footprint and virtual water calculations(12 14), and be used to assess the potential for increasing agricultural yields with renewable groundwaterref(15). the method could be modified to evaluate other resources with renewal rates that are slow and spatially heterogeneous, such as fisheries, forestry or soil."
Glendenning et al.,2012,Agricultural Water Management,balancing watershed and local scale impacts of rain water harvesting in india a review,"agricultural production in india has become increasingly reliant on groundwater and this has resulted in depletion of groundwater resources. rainwater harvesting (rwh) for groundwater recharge is seen as one of the solutions to solve the groundwater problem. this is reflected in an increase in watershed development programs, in which rwh is an important structural component. understanding the net effect of these development programs is crucial to ensure that net effect on groundwater is positive both locally and within a watershed. hence, this review focuses on the hydrological impacts of rwh for recharge at the local (individual structure) and watershed scale in rural areas. surprisingly little field evidence of the stated positive impacts at the local scale is available, and there are several potential negative impacts at the watershed scale. the watershed scale is underrepresented in the field studies and is mainly approached through modelling. modelling is seen as a possible tool to extend limited field data and scenario studies can be used to examine potential impacts. however, many past modelling studies examining rwh have either had limited focus or have been based on insufficient data. development of new modelling tools is needed in combination with increased field data collection. increased use of remote sensing and advanced statistical techniques are suggested as possible new opportunities. in addition, some evaluation criteria are proposed to assess the local and watershed scale hydrological, and other, impacts of rwh as part of watershed development.

Gorla et al.,2015,Water Resources Research,transient response of salix cuttings to changing water level regimes,"sustainable water management requires an understanding of the effects of flow regulation on riparian ecomorphological processes. we investigated the transient response of salix viminalis by examining the effect of water level regimes on its above ground and below ground biomass. four sets of salix cuttings, three juveniles (in the first growing season) and one mature (1 year old), were planted and initially grown under the same water level regime for 1 month. we imposed three different water level regime treatments representing natural variability, a seasonal trend with no peaks, and minimal flow (characteristic of hydropower) consisting of a constant water level and natural flood peaks. we measured sap flux, stem water potential, photosynthesis, growth parameters, and final root architecture. the mature cuttings were not affected by watertable dynamics, but the juveniles displayed causal relationships between the changing water regime, plant growth, and root distribution during a 2 month transient period. for example, a 50% drop in mean sap flux corresponded with a  1.5 mpa decrease in leaf water potential during the first day after the water regime was changed. in agreement with published field observations, the cuttings concentrated their roots close to the mean watertable of the corresponding treatment, allowing survival under altered conditions and resilience to successive stress events. juvenile development was strongly impacted by the minimum flow regime, leading to more than 60% reduction of both above ground and below ground biomass, with respect to the other treatments. hence, we suggest avoiding minimum flow regimes where salix restoration is prioritized."

Greenbaum et al.,2014,Quaternary Science Reviews,paleohydrology of extraordinary floods along the swakop river at the margin of the namib desert and their paleoclimate implications,"the swakop river is a major ephemeral river (drainage basin area about 30,000 km(2)) crossing the western namib desert. its hydrology and limited water resources depend on storms and floods. therefore, the hydrology and flow regime in the swakop river basin determines the availability of water for human use. in this study we present a millennia long record of extreme floods, using paleoflood hydrological methods and optically stimulated luminescence (osl) ages. the record includes 44 large floods ranging in date from the late pleistocene to the present. the oldest six to eight floods are dated from the late pleistocene to the mid holocene (between 14,900 +/  1700 and 5100 +/  620 years ago), with calculated peak discharges of 550 1280 m(3) s( 1). eighteen floods, eleven of which were between 1000 and 1600 m(3) s( 1), occurred between 740 +/  90 and 190 +/  10 years ago. additional 17 later floods occurred between about ad 1850 and 1963, with peak discharges between 100 and 1000 m(3) s( 1). the historical record which partly parallels the latter period recorded 17 large floods during the period 1893 1963. flood frequency analysis (ffa) of the combined systematically gaged record (1963 2003) and the paleoflood record since ad 1270 (740 +/  90 years, the most complete record), was applied using the maximum likelihood method. a two component extreme value distribution (tcev) estimates the 1% annual exceedance probability magnitude, using only the systematic gaged record at 520 m(3) s( 1). the combined paleoflood, historical, and gage records resulted in a much larger magnitudes for the 1% annual exceedance probability flood magnitude of 1320 1350 m(3) s( 1). the 0.1% annual exceedance probability magnitude is estimated at 770 m(3) s( 1) and 2100 2150 m(3) s( 1), respectively. the hydroclimatic interpretation of this paleoflood record is complex, due to the discontinuity of the record. during the late holocene, our flood data show three intervals differing in their flood regime: (1) 1280 +/  80 to 740 +/  90 years bp, with one extraordinary flood (>200 m(3) s( 1)) about every 180 years; (2) 740 +/  90 to 200 +/  45 c 14 years bp, with one large flood per 80 years; and (3) 200 +/  45 c 14 years bp to ad1963, with one large flood per 7 years. interval 2 represents large floods, probably related to the transition from a drier climate to the colder and probably wetter climate of the little ice age (lia). the third period relates to the end of the lia and to a wetter period of the 19th and early 20th centuries in which more rainfall in the kalahari and namib deserts and many historical floods were documented. the presence of three distinct calcretes rich in calcified rhizoliths at one of the sites, two of which were dated by osl to 13.2 +/  1.9 ka and 8.8 +/  1.0 ka, indicates, at least locally, higher moisture availability than in the current semiarid climate; the presence of denser vegetation can be associated with increased groundwater seepage and wetter climatic conditions.

Guyennon et al.,2016,Science of the Total Environment,long term climate sensitivity of an integrated water supply system: the role of irrigation,"the assessment of the impact of long term climate variability on water supply systems depends not only on possible variations of the resources availability, but also on the variation of the demand. in this framework, a robust estimation of direct (climate induced) and indirect (anthropogenically induced) effects of climate change ismandatory to design mitigation measures, especially in those regions of the planet where the groundwater equilibrium is strongly perturbed by exploitations for irrigation purposes. the main goal of this contribution is to propose a comprehensive model that integrates distributed crop water requirements with surface and groundwater mass balance, able to consider management rules of the water supply system. the proposed overall model, implemented, calibrated and validated for the case study of the fortore water supply system (apulia region, south italy), permits to simulate the conjunctive use of the water from a surface artificial reservoir and from groundwater. the relative contributions of groundwater recharges and withdrawals to the aquifer stress have been evaluated under different climate perturbations, with emphasis on irrigation practices. results point out that irrigated agriculture primarily affects groundwater discharge, indicating that ecosystem services connected to river base flow are particularly exposed to climate variation in irrigated areas. moreover, findings show that the recharge both to surface and to groundwater is mainly affected by drier climate conditions, while hotter conditions have a major impact on the water demand. the non linearity arising from combined drier and hotter conditions may exacerbate the aquifer stress by exposing it to massive sea water intrusion.

Hanasaki et al.,2018,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,a global hydrological simulation to specify the sources of water used by humans,"humans abstract water from various sources to sustain their livelihood and society. some global hydrological models (ghms) include explicit schemes of human water abstraction, but the representation and performance of these schemes remain limited. we substantially enhanced the water abstraction schemes of the h08 ghm. this enabled us to estimate water abstraction from six major water sources, namely, river flow regulated by global reservoirs (i.e., reservoirs regulating the flow of the world's major rivers), aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, seawater desalination, renewable groundwater, and nonrenewable groundwater. in its standard setup, the model covers the whole globe at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, and the calculation interval is 1 day. all the interactions were simulated in a single computer program, and all water fluxes and storage were strictly traceable at any place and time during the simulation period. a global hydrological simulation was conducted to validate the performance of the model for the period of 1979 2013 (landuse was fixed for the year 2000). the simulated water fluxes for water abstraction were validated against those reported in earlier publications and showed a reasonable agreement at the global and country level. the simulated monthly river discharge and terrestrial water storage (tws) for six of the world's most significantly human affected river basins were compared with gauge observations and the data derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace) satellite mission. it is found that the simulation including the newly added schemes outperformed the simulation without human activities. the simulated results indicated that, in 2000, of the 3628 +/  75 km(3) yr( 1) global freshwater requirement, 2839 +/  50 km(3) yr( 1) was taken from surfacewater and 789 +/  30 km(3) yr( 1) from groundwater. streamflow, aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, and seawater desalination accounted for 1786 +/  23, 199 +/  10, 106 +/  5, and 1.8 +/  0 km(3) yr( 1) of the surfacewater, respectively. the remaining 747 +/  45 km(3) yr( 1) freshwater requirement was unmet, or surfacewater was not available when and where it was needed in our simulation. renewable and nonrenewable groundwater accounted for 607 +/  11 and 182 +/  26 km(3) yr( 1) of the groundwater total, respectively. each source differed in its renewability, economic costs for development, and environmental consequences of usage. the model is useful for performing global water resource assessments by considering the aspects of sustainability, economy, and environment."
Hansen et al.,2012,Hydrogeology Journal,the economics of optimal urban groundwater management in southwestern usa,"groundwater serves as the primary water source for approximately 80% of public water systems in the united states, and for many more as a secondary source. traditionally management relies on groundwater to meet rising demand by increasing supply, but climate uncertainty and population growth require more judicious management to achieve efficiency and sustainability. over pumping leads to groundwater overdraft and jeopardizes the ability of future users to depend on the resource. optimal urban groundwater pumping can play a role in solving this conundrum. this paper investigates to what extent and under what circumstances controlled pumping improves social welfare. it considers management in a hydro economic framework and finds the optimal pumping path and the optimal price path. these allow for the identification of the social benefit of controlled pumping, and the scarcity rent, which is one tool to sustainably manage groundwater resources. the model is numerically illustrated with a case study from albuquerque, new mexico (usa). the albuquerque results indicate that, in the presence of strong demand growth, controlled pumping improves social welfare by 22%, extends use of the resource, and provides planners with a mechanism to advance the economic sustainability of groundwater."
Hao et al.,2013,Water Resources Management,a piecewise grey system model for study the effects of anthropogenic activities on karst hydrological processes,"sustainable groundwater development must rely on a good understanding of hydrological processes, especially under effects of anthropogenic activities. this paper develops a piecewise analysis based on grey system model for study effects of anthropogenic activities on hydrological processes. the time series of precipitation and spring discharge were segmented into three time periods depending on whether variations are due to climate variation: the predevelopment stage, the transition stage, and the new equilibrium stage. then we modeled hydrological process of the predevelopment stage and new equilibrium stage by the grey system model. by comparing the model results, we can quantify the effects of human activities on hydrological processes. we applied the model to liulin springs china. the results indicated that the hydraulic response time of the spring discharge to precipitation from the predevelopment stage to the new equilibrium stage, ranges from less than 1 year to up to 4 years. the results revealed that human activities slow the groundwater flow. gm (1,n) models of liulin springs discharge showed that the driving coefficients of precipitation to the spring discharge decreased from 0.012272 in the predevelopment stage to 0.007753 in the new equilibrium stage, which means that groundwater recharge ability has reduced about 36.82 %. human activities in liulin springs have drastically changed the groundwater system. piecewise grey system model is a robust method for hydrological process simulation."
Hao et al.,2014,Natural Hazards,investigation of karst hydrological processes by using grey auto incidence analysis,"the karst hydrological processes are the response of karst groundwater system to precipitation. the precipitation penetrates through the vadose zone, the subsequent groundwater pressure wave propagates to a spring outlet, and then, the spring discharge changes. this paper proposes a grey auto incidence analysis for studying the karst hydrological processes. the method can detect the periodicity of a time series, for example, precipitation and spring discharge. then the approach is applied to liulin springs basin, china. the results show that the auto incidence degree of precipitation reaches to the maximum (i.e., 0.816) when time delay equals to 8 years. the auto incidence degree of spring discharge reaches to the maximum (i.e., 0.865) when time delay equals to 3 years. these results show that the periodicity of precipitation is 8 years, and of spring discharge is 3 years. the difference of periodicity between the precipitation and the spring discharge reveals that the processes of precipitation recharging groundwater and groundwater transport are regulated or controlled by karst aquifer. because of heterogeneity of karst aquifer, the quick flow and base flow occur during the groundwater propagation, which causes the periodicity of spring discharge is not coincidence with of precipitation."
Hao et al.,2017,Science of the Total Environment,"the critical role of local policy effects in arid watershed groundwater resources sustainability: a case study in the minqin oasis, china","designed as a watershed groundwater restoration policy (wgrp), the comprehensive treatment program of the shiyang river basin (ctsrb) was launched in 2006 to restore the groundwater resources in the minqin oasis, northwestern china. this study sought to verify the recovery effects of ctsrb implementation from the perspective of groundwater depth. we reconstructed the spatio temporal distribution of groundwater depth at interannual and pixel scales by using digital groundwater depth models (dgdms), based on the ordinary kriging interpolation method. using dgdms data, various measures of the groundwatertable (e.g., regional depths, surface areas, depletion cones, and conditions in irrigated regions including ba, quanshan, and hu) were quantitatively analyzed and compared for the pre ctsrb (2001 2006), ctsrb i (2006 2010), and ctsrb ii (2010 2015) periods, forwhich spatial trends in the annual amplitudes of groundwater depthwere compared. finally, strategies that impacted the groundwater behavior before and during the ctsrb periods, possible indirect and adverse effects, and long termstrategies and prospectswere discussed. the results showed that groundwater depth first declined sharply, before increasing slowly and stabilizing after implementation of the ctsrb. areas of greater groundwater depth (<  20 m) and four groundwater depletion cones expanded during the pre ctsrb period, whereas variable shrinking trends were detected during the ctsrb period. spatial analysis showed that groundwater recovery mainly occurred along the periphery of the three irrigated regions, among which recovery effects in hu were more obvious than those in quanshan and ba, with pumping well densities the main reason for the difference. therefore, various strategies (increasing the surfacewater supply, reducing groundwater mining, and some other auxiliary measures) of ctsrb together supported groundwater recovery in the minqin oasis. overall, this research demonstrates an innovative perspective to verify the effects of wgrps in arid and semi arid areas.

Hartmann et al.,2017,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,enhanced groundwater recharge rates and altered recharge sensitivity to climate variability through subsurface heterogeneity,"our environment is heterogeneous. in hydrological sciences, the heterogeneity of subsurface properties, such as hydraulic conductivities or porosities, exerts an important control on waterbalance. this notably includes groundwater recharge, which is an important variable for efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management. current large scale hydrological models do not adequately consider this subsurface heterogeneity. here we show that regions with strong subsurface heterogeneity have enhanced present and future recharge rates due to a different sensitivity of recharge to climate variability compared with regions with homogeneous subsurface properties. our study domain comprises the carbonate rock regions of europe, northern africa, and the middle east, which cover similar to 25% of the total land area. we compare the simulations of two large scale hydrological models, one of them accounting for subsurface heterogeneity. carbonate rock regions strongly exhibit ""karstification,"" which is known to produce particularly strong subsurface heterogeneity. aquifers from these regions contribute up to half of the drinking water supply for some european countries. our results suggest that water management for these regions cannot rely on most of the presently available projections of groundwater recharge because spatially variable storages and spatial concentration of recharge result in actual recharge rates that are up to four times larger for present conditions and changes up to five times larger for potential future conditions than previously estimated. these differences in recharge rates for strongly heterogeneous regions suggest a need for groundwater management strategies that are adapted to the fast transit of water from the surface to the aquifers."
Hartmann et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,a multi model approach for improved simulations of future water availability at a large eastern mediterranean karst spring,"recent studies identified the mediterranean as a region particularly vulnerable to climate change. since a large fraction of the region's water originates from karst aquifers, information about their future water availability is important for sustainable water management. this study presents an ensemble of 50 model chains considering five different realisations of the a1b echam5 and hadcm3 climate projections, two different averaging methods to transfer the climate variables to the system scale and five different hydrological models that represent reasonable conceptualizations of the karst system. the ensemble is applied to faria spring, a large eastern mediterranean karst spring in the west bank. we show that for the near future (2021 2051) variability resulting from the different climate change projections and five different models is too large to draw conclusions on any significant change. in the remote future (2068 2098), variability decreases and our simulations suggest a decrease of water availability of  15% to  30%. we also assess the impact of recent pumping activities by running our hydrological models with recently measured data. there is a strong indication that the spring, which dried out in 2007, would have still yielded significant amounts of water if groundwater extractions had been limited. this calls for a better management of groundwater abstractions to meet future water needs in this drought prone mediterranean region.

Hartmann et al.,2014,Water Resources Research,modeling spatiotemporal impacts of hydroclimatic extremes on groundwater recharge at a mediterranean karst aquifer,"karst aquifers provide large parts of the water supply for mediterranean countries, though climate change is expected to have a significant negative impact on water availability. recharge is therefore a key variable that has to be known for sustainable groundwater use. in this study, we present a new approach that combines two independent methods for karst recharge estimation. the first method derives spatially distributed information of mean annual recharge patterns through gis analysis. the second is a process based karst model that provides spatially lumped but temporally distributed information about recharge. by combining both methods, we add a spatial reference to the lumped simulations of the process based model. in this way, we are able to provide spatiotemporal information of recharge and subsurface flow dynamics also during varying hydroclimatic conditions. we find that there is a nonlinear relationship between precipitation and recharge rates resulting in strong decreases of recharge following even moderate decreases of precipitation. this is primarily due to almost constant actual evapotranspiration amounts despite varying hydroclimatic conditions. during the driest year in the record, almost the entire precipitation was consumed as actual evapotranspiration and only little diffuse recharge took place at the high altitudes of our study site. during wettest year, recharge constituted a much larger fraction of precipitation and occurred at the entire study site. our new method and our findings are significant for decision makers in similar regions that want to prepare for possible changes of hydroclimatic conditions in the future. key points <list id=""wrcr21054 list 0001"" list type=""bulleted""> <list item id=""wrcr21054 li 0001"">a new approach for spatiotemporal recharge estimation for karst aquifers <list item id=""wrcr21054 li 0002"">impacts of hydroclimatic extremes on the entire karst system are elaborated <list item id=""wrcr21054 li 0003"">recharge rates are more sensitive to a precipitation decrease than an increase"
Hasan et al.,2016,Geotechnical and Geological Engineering,evaluation of subsurface lithologic units for groundwater exploration in the barind tract of bangladesh,"barind tract, located north western part of bangladesh, is one of the most diversified physiographic units of the country. the surfacewater supply in this part is particularly limited, so the irrigation is almost entirely depends on groundwater. however, overexploitation indicates falling groundwater heads in this area. the objective of present study is to examine the nature of the aquifer system barind tract of bangladesh in order to assess the sustainability of groundwater yield. borehole lithology data were collected, processed and analyzed for this purpose. representative panel diagram, 3 d stratigraphic and cross sectional views were also prepared for necessary assessment of the variation of individual subsurface stratum in different locations. the study identified three subsurface geologic formations namely, a top clay layer, sand layer of different grain size and at the bottom an impermeable clay zone. maps of formation thickness and index revealed that aquifer thickness is low in the north western corner and in some places of middle of south western corner. the thickness of sand formation in other places is recorded above 20 m. it is expect that the finding of the study will help groundwater resources development, planning and management in the area."

He et al.,2017,Water,hydrus simulation of sustainable brackish water irrigation in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system in the north china plain,"freshwater resources in the north china plain (ncp) are near depletion due to the unceasing overexploitation of deep groundwater, by far the most significant source of freshwater in the region. to deal with the deepening freshwater crisis, brackish water (rich but largely unused water in agriculture) is increasingly being used in irrigation in the region. however, inappropriate irrigation with brackish water could lead to soil salinization and cropland degradation. to evaluate such negative impacts, the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate soil salt transport and accumulation under 15 years of irrigation with brackish water. the irrigation scenarios included brackish water irrigation during the wintering and jointing stages of winter wheat and then freshwater irrigation just before the sowing of summer maize. freshwater irrigation was done to leach out soil salts, which is particularly vital in dry years. for the littoral region of the plain, hydrus id was used to simulate the irrigated cropping system stated above for a total period of 15 years. the results showed that it was feasible to use brackish water twice in one year, provided freshwater irrigation was performed before sowing summer maize. freshwater irrigation, in conjunction with precipitation, leached out soil salts from the 100 cm root zone depth. the maximum salt accumulation was in the 160 220 cm soil layer, which ensured that root zone soil was free of restrictive salinity for crop growth. precipitation was a critical determinant of the rate and depth leaching of soil salt. heavy rainfall (> 100 mm) caused significant leaching of soluble salts in the 0 200 cm soil profile. salt concentration under brackish water irrigation had no significant effect on the variations in the trend of soil salt transport in the soil profile. the variations of soil salinity were mainly affected by hydrological year type, for which the buried depth of soil salt was higher in wet years than in dry years. the study suggested that 15 years of irrigation with brackish water is a reliable and feasible mode of crop production in coastal regions with a thick soil column above the watertable. the scheme proposed in this study allowed the use of brackish water in irrigation without undue salinization of the crop soil layer, an intuitive way of resolving the deepening water crisis in the ncp study area and beyond."
He et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,evaluation of the value of radar qpe data and rain gauge data for hydrological modeling,"weather radar based quantitative precipitation estimation (qpe) is in principle superior to the areal precipitation estimated by using rain gauge data only, and therefore has become increasingly popular in applications such as hydrological modeling. the present study investigates the potential of using multiannual radar qpe data in coupled surfacewatergroundwater modeling with emphasis given to the groundwater component. since the radar qpe is partly dependent on the rain gauge observations, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of rain gauge network density on the quality of the estimated rainfall and subsequently the simulated hydrological responses. a headwater catchment located in western denmark is chosen as the study site. two hydrological models are built using the mike she code, where they have identical model structures expect for the rainfall forcing: one model is based on rain gauge interpolated rainfall, while the other is based on radar qpe which is a combination of both radar and rain gauge information. the two hydrological models are inversely calibrated and then validated against field observations. the model results show that the improvement introduced by using radar qpe data is in fact more obvious to groundwater than to surfacewater at daily scale. moreover, substantial negative impact on the simulated hydrological responses is observed due to the cut down in operational rain gauge network between 2006 and 2010. the radar qpe based model demonstrates the added value of the extra information from radar when rain gauge density decreases; however it is not able to sustain the level of model performance preceding the reduction in number of rain gauges."
Heilweil et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,noble gases and coupled heat/fluid flow modeling for evaluating hydrogeologic conditions of volcanic island aquifers,"understanding groundwater conditions in the upland parts of volcanic island aquifers is critical for sustainable groundwater development in these resource limited environments. yet groundwater conditions in such settings are generally difficult to characterize because of sparse well drilling (high cost and/or limited access). information needed for resource evaluation includes upland depth to water, recharge rate, and aquifer permeability. in this study, noble gas recharge temperatures and coupled heat/fluid flow modeling are used to indirectly infer these groundwater conditions. mosteiros basin on fogo island of the cape verde archipelago was selected as a representative volcanic island aquifer. simulation results are calibrated to watertable altitude and temperature data, along with indirect information provided by noble and dissolved gases. results of numerical modeling are most sensitive to recharge rates and hydraulic conductivity, less sensitive to basal heat flux, and not sensitive to porosity and thermal conductivity. simulation results show that only a relatively narrow range of combined recharge values (12 25% of precipitation) and hydraulic conductivity (10( 8) 10( 7) m s( 1)) is consistent with observed data. the simulated recharge of 3 6 million cubic meters per year (mm(3) yr( 1)) is much higher than measured discharge from the basin (0.25 mm(3) yr( 1)), indicating the occurrence of significant amounts of submarine groundwater discharge. the modeling results suggest a very deep upland watertable located 600 1000 m beneath the floor of the central caldera, although the watertable becomes more shallow and accessible towards the coast. perhaps most significant is the dominant role that modest amounts of recharge (mean rates of 70 140 mm yr( 1)) plays in decreasing the geothermal gradient, resulting in relatively cool temperatures in the deep vadose and at the watertable. noble gas recharge temperatures, constrained by numerical simulation results, range from about 15 to 22 degrees c and indicate a large watertable temperature lapse of about  15 degrees c/km, much steeper than typical adiabatic lapse rates. published by elsevier b.v."

Hendrickson et al.,2018,Water Research,impacts of groundwater management on energy resources and greenhouse gas emissions in california,"california faces significant energy and water infrastructure planning challenges in response to a changing climate. immediately following the most severe recorded drought, the state experienced one of its wettest water years in recorded history. despite the recent severe wet weather, much of the state's critical groundwater systems have not recovered from the drought. the recent sustainable groundwater management act (sgma) aims to eliminate future depletion risks, but may force california basins to seek alternative water sources by limiting groundwater withdrawals during droughts. these alternative water resources, such as recycled water or desalination, can have significantly higher energy demands in treatment and supply than local groundwater or surfacewater resources. this research developed potential scenarios of water supply sources for five overdrafted groundwater basins, and modeled the impacts of these scenarios on energy demands and greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions for water supply systems. our results reveal that energy demands and ghg emissions in different water supply scenarios can vary substantially between basins, but could increase statewide energy consumption as much as 2% and ghg emissions by 0.5. these results highlight the need to integrate these energy and ghg impacts into water resource management. better understanding these considerations enables water supply planners to avoid potential unintended consequences (i.e., increased energy demands and ghg emissions) of enhancing drought resilience.

Hiebing et al.,2018,Geosphere,"geophysical studies of fault and bedrock control on groundwater geochemistry within the southern mesilla basin, western texas and southern new mexico","the southern mesilla basin, located within western texas and southern new mexico, is one of two major sources of groundwater for the city of el paso, texas, and provides similar to 30% of the region's domestic groundwater needs. groundwater is also used for agriculture in the non urbanized regions of the basin. the basin is one of the southernmost basins of the rio grande rift where extension has overprinted older features, including extensive eocene trachyandesitic volcanism and laramide deformation. an increase in groundwater salinity is observed from north to south within the basin. some previous researchers have suggested that this salinity change is due to runoff and recharge from agricultural activity. we use a combination of gravity and groundwater geochemistry in an integrative study to determine the possible influences of faults and other subsurface structures on groundwater salinity and quality. gravity studies suggest the presence of other fault systems within the basin that serve as conduits for deeper, warmer, more si rich waters in the northern part of our study area, and as recharge zones for ca rich surface runoff from the carbonates of the franklin mountains in the eastern portion of our study area. the high ci/br ratios found in 90% of wells suggest that the salinity increase is primarily due to dissolution of evaporites within the basin rather than to deep basin brines. agricultural activity and water interaction with igneous and carbonate bedrock also are minor influences. this study highlights the unique resolving power of combining geophysical and geochemical techniques in understanding groundwater chemistry and its relationships with local geological structures. such an approach can be readily applied to other systems with similar geologic and hydrological settings for groundwater exploration and resource management."
Hoagstrom et al.,2011,Biological Conservation,a large scale conservation perspective considering endemic fishes of the north american plains,"regions with unique habitats often harbor endemic taxa associated with temporally stable habitats. we identified such habitats that sustain endemic fishes in the plains of north america. we also summarized threats to their conservation and identified remnant habitats that still harbor endemic fishes (refuges) based on post 1989 surveys. major springs, smaller, spring fed streams, larger rivers, and euryhaline habitats were associated with a total of 49 endemics. endemism was attributable to climatic refugia associated with each habitat type and dispersal limitation among major river drainages and springs. forty one endemic fishes (84%) were declining or extinct. dewatering, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation were main causes of declines, often present together. pollution and non native species were also threats in many cases. evidence for 53 existing refuges was found. we considered 34 refuges to be ""high quality"" because they harbored three or more endemics. twenty of these (those with available data) maintained consistent streamflow regimes for at least 50 years up to 2009. case studies suggest high stream length, more natural flow regimes, and fewer direct human impacts are features of high quality refuges, but extinction thresholds are unquantified and extinction debts of refuges are unknown. limited information on past extinctions suggests drought, a natural feature of the plains, combines with other threats to eliminate remnant endemic populations. long term conservation planning requires identification, protection, and restoration of high quality refuges to reduce extinction risk, especially during future drought periods. planning should be integrated with regional water resource planning, given scarcity of water in the region.

Hollander et al.,2016,Groundwater,"improved recharge estimation from portable, low cost weather stations","groundwater recharge estimation is a critical quantity for sustainable groundwater management. the feasibility and robustness of recharge estimation was evaluated using physical based modeling procedures, and data from a low cost weather station with remote sensor techniques in southern abbotsford, british columbia, canada. recharge was determined using the richards based vadose zone hydrological model, hydrus 1d. the required meteorological data were recorded with a hobotm weather station for a short observation period (about 1 year) and an existing weather station (abbotsford a) for long term study purpose (27years). undisturbed soil cores were taken at two locations in the vicinity of the hobotm weather station. the derived soil hydraulic parameters were used to characterize the soil in the numerical model. model performance was evaluated using observed soil moisture and soil temperature data obtained from subsurface remote sensors. a rigorous sensitivityanalysis was used to test the robustness of the model. recharge during the short observation period was estimated at 863 and 816mm. the mean annual recharge was estimated at 848 and 859mm/year based on a time series of 27 years. the relative ratio of annual recharge precipitation varied from 43% to 69%. from a monthly recharge perspective, the majority (80%) of recharge due to precipitation occurred during the hydrologic winter period. the comparison of the recharge estimates with other studies indicates a good agreement. furthermore, this method is able to predict transient recharge estimates, and can provide a reasonable tool for estimates on nutrient leaching that is often controlled by strong precipitation events and rapid infiltration of water and nitrate into the soil."
Holtz et al.,2012,Regional Environmental Change,"an agent based model of groundwater overexploitation in the upper guadiana, spain","irrigated agriculture is a main user of groundwater. achieving a sustainable use of groundwater will often require agricultural landuse changes such as shifting to entirely different kinds of crops and/or technologies. enhanced understanding of landuse change is hence required for developing policies for a sustainable water future. we use an agent based model to investigate the history of irrigated agriculture in the upper guadiana basin, spain, in order to learn about the influence of farmers' characteristics on landuse change and associated groundwater over use. a shift from vineyards and cereals to horticultural crops would provide a possibility for higher income with less water use. such a shift cannot be observed historically. the model results suggest that risk aversion and path dependency are insufficient to explain this observation, and the organisational set up of farms limiting the maximum labour force needs to be considered as additional explanatory factor. furthermore, it is shown that different types of farms existing in the ugb can be expected to exhibit distinct responses to drivers of landuse change such as agricultural policies. it is concluded that a sound understanding of the social system making use of a resource is required to solve problems of resource over use. this article demonstrates that agent based models can be useful tools to enhance such an understanding even in situations of scarce and uncertain data that are often encountered when dealing with resource use problems."
Hong et al.,2017,Journal of Geographical Sciences,multi object approach and its application to adaptive water management under climate change,"this paper addresses issues on adaptive water management under the impact of climate change. based on a set of comprehensive indicators of water system, a decision making approach of multi objects is developed and applied to quantify water adaptivemanagement for the demands of water sustainable use, water environmental protection and eco water requirement under the climate change. for this study in china, two key indicators are proposed, namely (1) the water resources vulnerability (v) that was represented by integrated sensitivity (s) and resilience (c) of climate change impact on water resources, and (2) the sustainability of socio economy and water environment, marked by dd, that is integrated scaler of socio economic development (eg) based on the amount of gdp and the water environment and relative eco system quality (li). to find a reasonable solution for adaptive water management, a multi objective decision making model of adaptive water management is further developed and the multi objective model was transformed into an integrated single optimization model through developing an integrated measure function, called as vdd=dd/v. this approach has been applied to adaptive water resources planning and management for case study of china with new policy, called as the strict management of water resources based on three red line controls, i.e., the control of total water use by the total water resources allocation, the control of lower water use efficiency by the water demand management and the control of the total waste water load by water quality management in the eastern china monsoon region that covers major eight big river basins including yangtze river, yellow river, haihe river and huaihe river. it is shown that the synthetic representation of water resource vulnerability and socio economic sustainability by the integrated objective function (vdd) and integrated decision making model are workable and practicable. adaptivemanagement effect of the criterion compliance rate and water use efficiency are more appreciable through new water policy of the three red line controls, which can reduce 21.3% of the water resources vulnerability (v) and increase 18.4% of the sustainability of socioeconomy and water environment (dd) for the unfavorable scenario of climate change in 2030."

Hoque et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,"c 14 dating of deep groundwater in the bengal aquifer system, bangladesh: implications for aquifer anisotropy, recharge sources and sustainability","environmental isotopes and c 14 dating were applied to estimate ages and recharge sources of deep groundwater (>= 150 m bgl) in south east bangladesh. with one exception, deep groundwater is shown to have been recharged more recently than 10 ka (range 3 9 ka, mean 7.6 ka), under climatic conditions indicated by delta o 18 and delta h 2 as similar to the present day. groundwater age distributions have been used to infer the scale of aquifer hydraulic anisotropy. 2d groundwater flow modelling is able to reproduce the observed vertical profiles of groundwater age, as determined at two locations, when the aquifer is assigned a permeability anisotropy (k x/k z) of at least 10(3). under these conditions, deep groundwater originates as recharge in the hill regions at the eastern boundary of the basin. recharge rates estimated from the groundwater ages are close to an estimate of the current rate of deep groundwater abstraction. cautious development and careful monitoring are therefore necessary, as excessive deep groundwater pumping could draw dissolved arsenic from the shallow levels of the bengal aquifer system (bas) and contaminate the deep groundwater resource.

House et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,projecting impacts of climate change on hydrological conditions and biotic responses in a chalk valley riparian wetland,"projected changes in climate are likely to substantially impact wetland hydrological conditions that will in turn have implications for wetland ecology. assessing ecohydrological impacts of climate change requires models that can accurately simulate water levels at the fine scale resolution to which species and communities respond. hydrological conditions within the lambourn observatory at boxford, berkshire, uk were simulated using the physically based, distributed model mike she, calibrated to contemporary surface and groundwater levels. the site is a 10 ha lowland riparian wetland where complex geological conditions and channel management exert strong influences on the hydrological regime. projected changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, channel discharge and groundwater level were derived from the uk climate projections 2009 ensemble of climate models for the 2080s under different scenarios. hydrological impacts of climate change differ through the wetland over short distances depending on the degree of groundwater/surfacewater interaction. discrete areas of groundwater upwelling are associated with an exaggerated response of water levels to climate change compared to non upwelling areas. these are coincident with regions where a weathered chalk layer, which otherwise separates two main aquifers, is absent. simulated water levels were linked to requirements of the mg8 plant community and desmoulin's whorl snail (vertigo moulinsiana) for which the site is designated. impacts on each are shown to differ spatially and in line with hydrological impacts. differences in water level requirements for this vegetation community and single species highlight the need for separate management strategies in distinct areas of the wetland.

House et al.,2016,Hydrological Processes,modelling groundwater/surfacewater interaction in a managed riparian chalk valley wetland,"understanding hydrological processes in wetlands may be complicated by management practices and complex groundwater/surfacewater interactions. this is especially true for wetlands underlain by permeable geology, such as chalk. in this study, the physically based, distributed model mike she is used to simulate hydrological processes at the centre for ecology and hydrology river lambourn observatory, boxford, berkshire, uk. this comprises a 10 ha lowland, chalk valley bottom, riparian wetland designated for its conservation value and scientific interest. channel management and a compound geology exert important, but to date not completely understood, influences upon hydrological conditions. model calibration and validation were based upon comparisons of observed and simulated groundwater heads and channel stages over an equally split 20 month period. model results are generally consistent with field observations and include short term responses to events as well as longer term seasonal trends. an intrinsic difficulty in representing compressible, anisotropic soils limited otherwise excellent performance in some areas. hydrological processes in the wetland are dominated by the interaction between groundwater and surfacewater. channel stage provides head boundaries for broad water levels across the wetland, whilst areas of groundwater upwelling control discrete head elevations. a relic surface drainage network confines flooding extents and routes seepage to the main channels. in channel macrophyte growth and its management have an acute effect on water levels and the proportional contribution of groundwater and surfacewater. the implications of model results for management of conservation species and their associated habitats are discussed. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Hrachowitz et al.,2011,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,on the value of combined event runoff and tracer analysis to improve understanding of catchment functioning in a data scarce semi arid area,"hydrological processes in small catchments are not quite understood yet, which is true in particular for catchments in data scarce, semi arid regions. this is in contrast with the need for a better understanding of water fluxes and the interactions between surface and groundwater in order to facilitate sustainable water resources management in such environments, where both floods and droughts can result in severe crop loss. in this study, event runoff coefficient analysis and limited tracer data of four small, nested sub catchments (0.4 25.3 km(2)) in a data scarce, semi arid region of tanzania helped to characterize the distinct response of the study catchments and to gain insights into the dominant runoff processes. the estimated event runoff coefficients were very low and did not exceed 0.09. they were found to be significantly related to the 5 day antecedent precipitation totals as well as to base flow, indicating a close relation to changes in soil moisture and thus potential switches in runoff generation processes. the time scales of the ""direct flow"" reservoirs, used to compute the event runoff coefficients, were up to one order of magnitude reduced for extreme events, compared to ""average"" events, suggesting the activation of at least a third flow component, besides base and direct flow, assumed to be infiltration overland flow. analysis of multiple tracers highlighted the importance of pre event water to total runoff, even during intense and high yield precipitation events. it further illustrated the distinct nature of the catchments, in particular with respect to the available water storage, which was suggested by different degrees of tracer damping in the individual streams. the use of multiple tracers subsequently allowed estimating uncertainties in hydrograph separations arising from the use of different tracers. the results highlight the presence of considerable uncertainties, emphasizing the need for multiple tracers in order to avoid misleading results. this study shows the value of hydrological data collection over one whole wet season using multi tracers to improve the understanding of hydrological functioning and thus for water resources management in data scarce, semi arid environments."
Hsu et al.,2012,Hydrogeology Journal,"basin scale groundwater response to precipitation variation and anthropogenic pumping in chih ben watershed, taiwan","the sustainable use of groundwater has become increasingly challenging due to extreme hydrological events and anthropogenic activity. in this study, the basin scale groundwater response to precipitation variation was analyzed using an integrated model that comprises lumped models for land and river recharges and a distributed model for groundwater. the integrated model was applied to the chih ben watershed, taiwan, using 20 years (1988 2007) of data. the hydrological data were analyzed for trends using statistical tests. based on decreasing trends in precipitation and groundwater levels and an increasing trend in stream flow, the oblique cut method was applied to precipitation and excess infiltration to assess land and streambed recharge. distributed numerical groundwater modeling was used to simulate the basin scale groundwater responses to precipitation variation and anthropogenic pumping. the model was calibrated using stable isotope and groundwater level data. the safe yields were estimated for the chih ben watershed for dry, wet, and normal precipitation scenarios. the safe yield of groundwater was shown to vary with precipitation, which does not guarantee the sustainable use of groundwater resources. instead, water resources should be assessed at a basin scale, taking into account the whole ecosystem, rather than only considering water for human consumption in the alluvium."
Hu et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,riverbank filtration in china: a review and perspective,"riverbank filtration (rbf) for water supplies is used widely throughout the world because it guarantees a sustainable quantity and improves water quality. in this study, the development history and the technical overview of rbf in china are reviewed and summarized. most rbf systems in china were constructed using vertical wells, horizontal wells, and infiltration galleries in flood plains, alluvial fans, and inter mountain basins. typical pollutants such as nh4+, pathogens, metals, and organic materials were removed or diluted by most rbf investigated. there have recently been many investigations of the interaction between groundwater and surfacewater and biogeochemical processes in rbf. comprehensive rbf applications should include not only the positive but also negative effects. based on a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages, the perspectives of china's rbf technology development were proposed. to protect the security of water supply, china's rbf systems should establish a management system, monitoring system and forecasting system of risk. guidelines of rbf construction and management should also be issued on the basic of relevant fundamental investigations such as climate influence, clogging, and purification mechanism of water quality improvement.

Hu et al.,2019,Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management,role of heterogeneous behavioral factors in an agent based model of crop choice and groundwater irrigation,"unsustainable groundwater use has led to the lowering of groundwater levels and the degradation of groundwater dependent ecosystems worldwide. integrated hydrologic ecological economic models have been developed to simulate and optimize the coupled human and groundwater systems, and address the issue of unsustainable groundwater use. however, a lack of understanding of the heterogeneity of groundwater users undermines the performance of the integrated models. in this paper, an agent based model is developed using a two stage optimization strategy with the goal of optimizing the decision making of heterogeneous farmers on crop choice and groundwater irrigation. the performance of the optimization strategy is evaluated under the influence of four behavioral factors. the results illustrate that the optimization strategy can lead to higher crop profits or a slower rate of groundwater depletion in comparison with the observations, but does not necessarily guarantee the optimal solution in balancing these two objectives. in order to achieve sustainable groundwater use, the roles that behavioral factors play in farmers' decision making need to be better understood, and better accounted for in groundwater policy."
Huang et al.,2012,Water Resources Management,groundwater overexploitation causing land subsidence: hazard risk assessment using field observation and spatial modelling,"hazard risk assessment of land subsidence is a complicated issue aiming at identifying areas with potentially high environmental hazard due to land subsidence. the methods of hazard risk assessment of land subsidence were reviewed and a new systematic approach was proposed in this study. quantitative identification of land subsidence is important to the hazard risk assessment. field observations using extensometers were used to determine assessment indexes and estimate weights of each index. spatial modelling was also established in arcgis to better visualize the assessment data. these approaches then were applied to the chengnan region, china as a case study. three factors, thickness of the second confined aquifer, thickness of the soft clay and the annual recovery rate of groundwater level were incorporated into the hazard risk assessment index system. the weights of each index are 0.33, 0.17 and 0.5 respectively. the zonation map shows that the high, medium and low risk ranked areas for land subsidence account for 9.5 %, 44.7 % and 45.8 % of the total area respectively. the annual recovery rate of groundwater level is the major factor raising land subsidence hazard risk in approximately half of the study area."
Huang et al.,2019,Water,hydrogeological parameter determination in the southern catchments of taiwan by flow recession method,"the understanding of hydrogeological characteristics and groundwater flow processes in aquifers is crucial for the determination of sustainable groundwater resource development as well as hydrological management and planning. in the past, information on hydrogeological characteristics was mainly acquired through point field measurement such as borehole geophysical techniques and field aquifer hydraulic testing. however, in view of the cost limitations and scale applicability of these methods, low flow recession analysis techniques that utilize streamflow data can be used as alternative low cost methods to reversely back calculate hydrogeological parameters based on the hydrological processes by which groundwater from aquifers is naturally discharged to rivers. we chose southern taiwan as the study area for the estimation of the recession index (k), which is representative of catchment discharge behavior during both the dry and wet seasons, to determine seasonal differences in the aquifer flow regime and to estimate the following three hydrogeological parameters: hydraulic conductivity (k), specific yield (s y), and transmissivity (t). based on the field test reports of the locations of groundwater observational wells on the chianan and pingtung plains, the study area was divided into the chianan sub area (zengwun, yanshui, and erren river basins) and the kaoping sub area (kaoping, donggang, and linbian river basins). the estimation results of the present study were compared to the field test results. the results showed significant differences in the recession index k between the dry and wet seasons. slight differences between the estimated hydrogeological parameters and the field test results were also observed for the two sub areas because of differences in scale. furthermore, regional differences in the estimation results were found to be consistent with the distribution of geological structures, which indicates a high degree of feasibility in the application of flow recession methods for catchment scale hydrogeological parameter determination."
Huang et al.,2018,Science of the Total Environment,landuse change impacts on the amount and quality of recharge water in the loess tablelands of china,"exploring how landuse change (luc) influences the amount and quality of recharge water is important for groundwater sustainability and landuse planning. with loess of up to 200 m in thickness and unsaturated zones up to 100 m below the surface, the loess tablelands in china can store abundant groundwater resources. however, groundwater depletion and substantial luc have been simultaneously observed. it is thus necessary to investigate the relationship between luc and groundwater. we sampled 10 m soil profiles for three landuse types (farmlands, apple orchards of 10 and 20 years old). after measuring the chloride and nitrate concentration in soil pore water, the luc effects on the amount and quality of recharge water quality were quantified based on the mass balance method. results showed that soil moisture in aged (20 year old) apple orchards was significantly reduced relative to that measured in farmlands and younger (10 year old) orchards, where measured soil moistures were roughly equal. the accumulated nitrate nitrogen and the depth below which nitrate is stable was smallest in farmlands, intermediate in 10 year old apple orchards, and largest under 20 year old apple orchards. the diffuse recharge was 33.0 +/  17.9 mm year( 1) accounting for 7.3 +/  1.8% of mean annual precipitation under farmlands; however, the conversion from farmlands to 20 year old apple orchards reduced recharge by 42%. the nitrate infiltrating to groundwater annually was 4.9 +/  2.9 kg hm( 2) and 4.1 +/  3.1 kg hm( 2) under farmlands and 20 year old apple orchards, respectively. the impacts of luc over the past decades have not yet reached groundwater because of low recharge rates; further, the primary factor influencing groundwater quality is recharge rate rather than pollutant concentration. as such, the luc from farmland to apple orchard has little impact on shortterm groundwater recharge and quality; long term impact, however, may be significant.

Huggenberger et al.,2013,Environmental Earth Sciences,"concepts for the sustainable management of multi scale flow systems: the groundwater system within the laufen basin, switzerland","many groundwater systems consist of multi scale aquifer units. the exchange processes and rates between these aquifer units are complex. in order to manage such complex systems, a subdivision into different catchments, sub catchments or groundwater bodies as manageable units is required. the sustainable management of water resources requires a comprehensive view of water quality and water quantity aspects not only for water supply issues, but generally also for flood protection and riverine ecosystem functions. such transformations require an improved understanding of recharge and exchange processes between different aquifer units as well as aquifer surfacewater interaction processes at different spatiotemporal scales. the main objective of this study is to illustrate concepts by defining the geometry and scales of different aquifer units within a sedimentary basin. the laufen basin in the jura mountains represents a sub catchment of the river birs (switzerland). its structure is characterized by a pronounced local relief and a series of aquifer units which are typical for many complex groundwater systems in front of mountain chains such as the alpine foreland and the jura mountains of central europe. a combination of different concepts is required to understand multi scale flow systems and to describe the various hydrogeological processes. three concepts are proposed for the laufen basin, including: (1) a regional flow system analysis, based on the concept of hierarchical groundwater flow systems; (2) the river corridor concept for understanding aquifer surfacewater interaction processes; and (3) the calculation of the dynamic vulnerability index and the aquifer base gradient approach for karst flow and fractured flow systems."
Hugman et al.,2013,Journal of Hydrology,the importance of temporal scale when optimising abstraction volumes for sustainable aquifer exploitation: a case study in semi arid south portugal,"aquifer sustainable yields are often defined as a single value based on long term averages or annual values of recharge. however, these time scales can be too coarse for the systems to which they are being applied and can lead to over  or underexploitation of groundwater. a numerical model of the querenca silves aquifer in portugal is used to develop hypothetical scenarios in which abstraction rates for public water supply are adapted at various time scales and are defined based on a percentage of the recharge which occurred during the previous period. the purpose is to understand the effects and feasibility of varying the temporal scale at which groundwater abstraction is modified in order to maximise sustainable yield and minimise freshwater losses. results show that, for the querenca silves aquifer, reducing the time scale for which sustainable yield is defined allows for an increase in withdrawal volumes whilst maintaining the sustainability of the system. in fact, not reducing the temporal scale leads to an irretrievable loss of freshwater during recharge periods. furthermore, predicted seasonal changes in rainfall for portugal will make taking the temporal scale of the system into account more important, as the concentration of recharge into a shorter period will lead to faster depletion.

Hugman et al.,2012,Hydrological Processes,influence of aquifer properties and the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge and abstraction on sustainable yields in semi arid regions,"this paper aims to contribute to understanding the importance of four factors on the determination of sustainable yields: (i) aquifer properties; (ii) temporal distribution of recharge; (iii) temporal distribution of groundwater pumping; and (iv) spatial distribution of pumping wells. it is important to comprehend how the present day and future vulnerability of groundwater systems to pumping activities depend on these critical factors and what the risks are of considering sustainable yield as a fixed percentage of mean annual recharge (mar). a numerical model of the querencasilves aquifer in portugal is used to develop hypothetical scenarios with which these factors are studied. results demonstrate the aquifer properties, particularly the storage coefficient, have an important role in determining the resilience of an aquifer and therefore to which degree it is dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of abstraction and recharge, as well as the occurrence of extreme events. sustainable yields are determined for the developed scenarios based on specific criteria rather than a fraction of mar. under simplified current recharge and abstraction conditions, the sustainable yield was determined at approximately 73% of mar or 76 million?m3. when considering a concentration of rainfall in time, as predicted by climate scenarios for the region, sustainable yield could drop to ca 70% of mar. however, a more even distribution of pumping volumes throughout the year could increase this value. the location of the pumping wells is seen to affect the distribution of hydraulic heads in the aquifer, albeit without significant changes in sustainable yield. copyright (c) 2011 john wiley & sons, ltd."

Huneau et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,"flow pattern and residence time of groundwater within the south eastern taoudeni sedimentary basin (burkina faso, mali)","the knowledge about groundwater flow conditions within the southeastern taoudeni basin aquifer shared by burkina faso and mali is relatively limited with very little information on potentiometric heads, recharge processes, residence time and water quality. a better evaluation of groundwater resources in this area is a strategic point for water resources management in the entire soudano sahelian region which endures since the beginning of the twentieth century a continuous decrease in precipitation amount. this paper provides a transboundary synthesis using water (o 18, h 2 and h 3) and carbon isotopes (c 13 and c 14) in conjunction with hydrogeological and hydrochemical data. the objectives are to improve the conceptual model of groundwater recharge and flow within this sandstone reservoir, and to assess the changes in the aquifer due to water abstraction and recent climate changes including an insight into sahelian aquifers palaeorecharge processes. the local meteoric water line for the bobo dioulasso station is proposed: delta h 2 = 8.0 (+/  0.5)delta o 18 + 10.2 (+/  2.1). two main tendencies can be derived from groundwater chemistry. first, a slight evolution from the ca mg hco3 type towards a na k hco3 type that indicates developed interactions between groundwater and clay minerals related to the residence time of groundwater. a second tendency towards cl no3 so4 hco3 water types indicates the anthropogenic influence on groundwater related to the poor sanitary conditions observed around wells. the carbon 14 activity measured on the tdic varies between 0.3 and 122 pmc, so our record contains samples covering a wide period from actual to pleistocene suggesting a continuous recharge of the system through time even if the sahel region has endured many different climate phases which have influenced the infiltration and recharge processes. all groundwater samples have stable isotope compositions in the range of the present day regional and global meteoric water line which suggests that the sampled groundwater was not significantly affected by evaporation during recharge. evolved waters are depleted relative to unevolved samples by 1.5 2 parts per thousand in delta o 18 and 10 15 parts per thousand. in delta h 2. the whole dataset support the hypothesis of a largely unified homogeneous aquifer system with a multilayered structure but it also points out the very low renewability of the resource and a strong anthropogenic contamination of the shallowest horizons.

Iverach et al.,2017,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,a multi tracer approach to constraining artesian groundwater discharge into an alluvial aquifer,"understanding pathways of recharge to alluvial aquifers is important for maintaining sustainable access to groundwater resources. waterbalance modelling is often used to proportion recharge components and guide sustainable groundwater allocations. however, it is not common practice to use hydrochemical evidence to inform and constrain these models. here we compare geochemical versus waterbalance model estimates of artesian discharge into an alluvial aquifer, and demonstrate why multi tracer geochemical analyses should be used as a critical component of waterbudget assessments. we selected a site in australia where the great artesian basin (gab), the largest artesian basin in the world, discharges into the lower namoi alluvium (lna), an extensively modelled aquifer, to convey the utility of our approach. water stable isotopes (delta o 18 and delta h 2) and the concentrations of na+ and hco3  suggest a continuum of mixing in the alluvial aquifer between the gab (artesian component) and surface recharge, whilst isotopic tracers (h 3, c 14, and cl 36) indicate that the alluvial groundwater is a mixture of groundwaters with residence times of <70 years and groundwater that is potentially hundreds of thousands of years old, which is consistent with that of the gab. in addition, cl  concentrations provide a means to calculate a percentage estimate of the artesian contribution to the alluvial groundwater. in some locations, an artesian contribution of up to 70% is evident from the geochemical analyses, a finding that contrasts with previous regional scale waterbalance modelling estimates that attributed 22% of all inflow for the corresponding zone within the lna to gab discharge. our results show that hydrochemical investigations need to be undertaken as part of developing the conceptual framework of a catchment waterbalance model, as they can improve our understanding of recharge pathways and better constrain artesian discharge to an alluvial aquifer."
Izady et al.,2017,Hydrological Processes,groundwater recharge estimation in arid hardrock alluvium aquifers using combined watertable fluctuation and groundwaterbalance approaches,"this paper proposes an approach to estimate groundwater recharge using an optimization based watertable fluctuation method combined with a groundwaterbalance model in an arid hardrock alluvium region, located at the oman united arab emirates border. we introduce an effective hardrock thickness term to identify the percentage of the considered hardrock thickness in which effective groundwater flow takes place. the proposed method is based upon a thiessen polygon zoning approach. the method includes subpolygons to represent specific geologic units and to enhance the confidence of the estimated groundwater recharge. two linear and 1 nonlinear submodels were developed to evaluate the model components for the calibration (october 1996 to september 2008) and validation (october 2008 to september 2013) periods. long term annual groundwater recharge from rainfall and return flow over the model domain are estimated as 24.62 and 5.71mm(3), respectively, while the effective groundwater flow circulation is found to occur in the upper 7% of the known hardrock thickness (42m), confirming conclusions of previous field studies. considering a total difference in groundwater levels between eastern and western points of the study area of the order of 220m and a 12 year monthly calibration period, a weighted root mean squared error in predicted groundwater elevation of 2.75m is considered quite reasonable for the study area characterized by remarkable geological and hydrogeological diversity. the proposed approach provides an efficient and robust method to estimate groundwater recharge in regions with a complex geological setting in which interaction between fractured and porous media cannot be easily assessed."
Izady et al.,2017,Water,groundwater modeling and sustainability of a transboundary hardrock alluvium aquifer in north oman mountains,"this study aims at modeling groundwater flow using modflow in a transboundary hardrock alluvium aquifer, located in northwestern oman. a three dimensional stratigraphic model of the study area representing the vertical and spatial extent of four principal hydro geologic units (specifically, the hawasina, ophiolite, tertiary and alluvium) was generated using data collected from hundreds drilled borehole logs. layer elevations and materials for four layers grid cells were taken from the generated stratigraphic model in which the materials and elevations were inherited from the stratigraphic model that encompasses the cell. this process led to accurate grid so that the developed groundwater conceptual model was mapped to simulate the groundwater flow and to estimate groundwaterbalance components and sustainable groundwater extraction for the october 1996 to september 2013 period. results show that the long term lateral groundwater flux ranging from 4.23 to 11.69 mm(3)/year, with an average of 5.67 mm(3)/year, drains from the fractured eastern ophiolite mountains into the alluvial zone. moreover, the long term regional groundwater sustainable groundwater extraction is 18.09 mm(3)/year for 17 years, while it is, respectively, estimated as 14.51, 16.31, and 36.00 mm(3)/year for dry, normal, and wet climate periods based on standardized precipitation index (spi) climate condition. considering a total difference in groundwater levels between eastern and western points of the study area on the order of 228 m and a 12 year monthly calibration period (october 1996 to september 2008), a root mean squared error (rmse) in predicted groundwater elevation of 2.71 m is considered reasonable for the study area characterized by remarkable geological and hydrogeological diversity. a quantitative assessment of the groundwaterbalance components and particularly sustainable groundwater extraction for the different hydrological period would help decision makers to better understand the water resources in the al buraimi region. in addition, it would assist decision makers to improve existing strategies to enhance the decision making for future developments."

Jang et al.,2013,Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,integrating the spatial variability of water quality and quantity to probabilistically assess groundwater sustainability for use in aquaculture,"aquaculture industries generally extract large amounts of groundwater for the cultivation of fish. to reduce the adverse effects on fish cultivation and groundwater drawdown, this study develops a method that simultaneously considers the spatial variability of groundwater in terms of quality and quantity in order to determine sustainable groundwater use for aquaculture in the pingtung plain, taiwan. because of limited observation data with high prediction uncertainty, sequential indicator simulation (sis) was adopted to reproduce the spatial distributions of the main pollutants in groundwater, manganese and ammonium nitrogen. the corresponding distributions of the groundwater utilization ratio (gur), which is defined as the ratio showing the volume of groundwater utilization compared to pond water, were determined based on the mass balance of the hydrochemical parameters in the groundwater, surfacewater, and pond water. four categories in groundwater utilization gur < 0.1 (strictly limited), 0.1 a parts per thousand broken vertical bar gur < 0.5 (minor), 0.5 a parts per thousand broken vertical bar gur < 1 (major), and gur = 1 (completely used) were characterized based on estimated probabilities. a safe gur was selected from a maximum estimation probability of the groundwater categories. sis was also used to grade the transmissivity fields for gauging the pumping capacity of the aquifers. finally, for different conditions indicating groundwater quality and quantity, the combinations were delineated spatially to provide decision makers with detailed information which will enable them to wisely select a reliable scheme for groundwater management of fishponds. the analytical results reveal that groundwater can be completely used for fish farming in 6.9 % of aquifers, but should serve as a minor water resource for fishponds in 8.6 % of aquifers."

Jang et al.,2017,Water,aquifer vulnerability assessment for sustainable groundwater management using drastic,"groundwater management and protection has been facilitated by computational modeling of aquifer vulnerability and monitoring aquifers using groundwater sampling. the drastic (depth to water, recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of vadose zone media, and hydraulic conductivity) model, an overlay and index gis model, has been used for groundwater quality assessment because it relies on simple, straightforward methods. aquifer vulnerability mapping identifies areas with high pollution potential that can be areas for priority management and monitoring. the objectives of this study are to demonstrate how aquifer vulnerability assessment can be achieved using drastic with high resolution data. this includes calibrating drastic weights using a binary classifier calibration method with a genetic algorithm (bi ga), identifying areas of high potential aquifer vulnerability, and selecting potential aquifer monitoring sites using spatial statistics. the aquifer vulnerability results from drastic using bi ga were validated with a well database of observed nitrate concentrations for a study area in indiana. the drastic results using bi ga showed that approximately 42.2% of nitrate detections >2 ppm are within high and very high vulnerability areas (representing 3.4% of study area) as simulated by drastic. moreover, 53.4% of the nitrate detections were within the moderate vulnerability class (26.9% of study area), and only 4.3% of the nitrate detections were within the low vulnerability class (60.1% of study area). nitrates >2 ppm were not detected at all within the very low vulnerability class (9.6% of area). high and very high vulnerability areas should be regarded as priority areas for groundwater monitoring and efforts to prevent groundwater contamination. this case study suggests that the approach may be applicable to other areas as part of efforts to target groundwater management efforts."
Jassas et al.,2014,Water,"estimating groundwater recharge in the semiarid al khazir gomal basin, north iraq","the mean annual recharge of al khazir gomal basin was estimated as a basis for decision makers regarding the renewability and sustainability of groundwater. for this purpose, two approaches were used: hydrograph analysis and watertable fluctuation (wtf). the long term mean daily stream flow records of al khazir river (1969 1981) were used to estimate groundwater discharge by base flow hydrograph separation and displacement recession curve methods. four base flow separation methods were used; one is the graphical separation method, and three are automated separation methods included in the web based hydrograph analysis tool. the annual recharge estimated by wtf was 111.6 mm/y, and the average annual recharge estimated by the four base flow separation methods was 125.8 mm/y. estimating recharge by the watertable fluctuation method does not incorporate spatial variability contained in the whole watershed, because the specific yield did not represent the entire basin. however, the hydrograph analysis method can give a comprehensive estimation of the net integrated recharge for the entire watershed, which includes different recharge mechanisms. the displacement recession curve method deviates a lot (>30 mm/y) from the other methods, which indicates that this method may not be suitable to apply in such large watersheds."

Kasprzyk et al.,2013,Environmental Modelling & Software,many objective robust decision making for complex environmental systems undergoing change,"this paper introduces many objective robust decision making (mordm). mordm combines concepts and methods from many objective evolutionary optimization and robust decision making (rdm), along with extensive use of interactive visual analytics, to facilitate the management of complex environmental systems. many objective evolutionary search is used to generate alternatives for complex planning problems, enabling the discovery of the key tradeoffs among planning objectives. rdm then determines the robustness of planning alternatives to deeply uncertain future conditions and facilitates decision makers' selection of promising candidate solutions. mordm tests each solution under the ensemble of future extreme states of the world (sow). interactive visual analytics are used to explore whether solutions of interest are robust to a wide range of plausible future conditions (i.e., assessment of their pareto satisficing behavior in alternative sow). scenario discovery methods that use statistical data mining algorithms are then used to identify what assumptions and system conditions strongly influence the cost effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the robust alternatives. the framework is demonstrated using a case study that examines a single city's water supply in the lower rio grande valley (lrgv) in texas, usa. results suggest that including robustness as a decision criterion can dramatically change the formulation of complex environmental management problems as well as the negotiated selection of candidate alternatives to implement. mordm also allows decision makers to characterize the most important vulnerabilities for their systems, which should be the focus of ex post monitoring and identification of triggers for adaptivemanagement.

Katuwal et al.,2018,Crop Science,"growth stage based irrigation management on biomass, yield, and yield attributes of spring canola in the southern great plains","extensive use of groundwater for irrigation has significantly depleted the ogallala aquifer, threatening the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the southern great plains. there is a need to identify a low water requiring alternative crop and understand the response of that crop to deficit irrigation strategies. the objective of this study was to assess biomass partitioning and yield of spring canola (brassica napus l.) under deficit irrigation. three diverse canola cultivars ('h930', 'h955', and 'l140') were grown under four different irrigation treatments; full season irrigation (fi), no irrigation at the vegetative stage (vs), no irrigation at the reproductive stage (rs) and dryland (dl) at clovis, nm, on olton clay loam soil. seed yield of vs was similar to fl in both years but was greater by 93 and 200% in 2015 and by 120 and 263% in 2016 than rs and dl, respectively. biomass and oil yield of vs were similar to those of fi in 2015 but were lower by 14% in 2016. relieving water stress with irrigation at flowering increased leaf area index of vs and made it similar to that of fi by pod development stage. biomass accumulation was greater in treatments receiving irrigation after flowering and most of the post flowering biomass was partitioned into reproductive parts. among yield components, greater 1000seed weight in vs than rs and dl, indicated recovery of canola stressed at the vegetative stage. results indicated that if water is limited, the vegetative growth stage would be a better time to skip irrigation in spring canola."

Keir et al.,2019,Groundwater,stochastic modeling of groundwater extractions over a data sparse region of australia,"setting limit on groundwater extractions is important to ensure sustainable groundwater management. lack of extraction data can affect interpretations of historical pressure changes, predictions of future impacts, accuracy of groundwater model calibration, and identification of sustainable management options. yet, many groundwater extractions are unmetered. therefore, there is a need for models that estimate extraction rates and quantify model outputs uncertainties arising due to a lack of data. this paper develops such a model within the generalized linear modeling (glm) framework, using a case study of stock and domestic (sd) extractions in the surat cumulative management area, a predominantly cattle farming region in eastern australia. various types of extraction observations were used, ranging from metering to analytically derived estimates. glms were developed and applied to estimate the property level extraction amounts, where observation types were weighted by perceived relative accuracy, and well usage status. the primary variables found to affect property level extraction rates were: yearly average temperature and rainfall, pasture, property area, and number of active wells; while variables most affecting well usage were well water electrical conductivity, spatial coordinates, and well age. results were compared with analytical estimates of property level extraction, illustrating uncertainties and potential biases across 20 hydrogeological units. spatial patterns of mean extraction rates (and standard deviations) are presented. it is concluded that glms are well suited to the problem of extraction rate estimation and uncertainty analysis, and are ideal when model verification is supported by measurement of a random sample of properties."

Kifanyi et al.,2017,Sustainability,a quantitative groundwater resource management under uncertainty using a retrospective optimization framework,"water resources are a major concern for any socio economic development. as the quality of many surface fresh water sources increasingly deteriorate, more pressure is being imparted into groundwater aquifers. since groundwater and the aquifers that host it are inherently vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts, there is a need for sustainable pumping strategies. however, groundwater resource management is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of aquifer systems. aquifer hydrogeology is highly uncertain, and thus it is imperative that this uncertainty is accounted for when managing groundwater resource pumping. this, therefore, underscores the need for an efficient optimization tool which can sustainably manage the resource under uncertainty conditions. in this paper, we apply a procedure which is new within the context of groundwater resource management the retrospective optimization approximation (roa) method. this method is capable of designing sustainable groundwater pumping strategies for aquifers which are characterized by uncertainty arising due to scarcity of input data. roa framework solves and evaluates a sequence of optimization sub problems in an increasing number of realizations. we used k means clustering sampling technique for the realizations selection. the methodology is demonstrated through application to an hypothetical example. the optimization problem was solved and analyzed using ""active set"" algorithm implemented under matlab environment. the results indicate that the roa sampling based method is a promising approach for optimizing groundwater pumping rates under conditions of hydrogeological uncertainty."

Kim et al.,2011,Limnology and Oceanography,submarine groundwater discharge from oceanic islands standing in oligotrophic oceans: implications for global biological production and organic carbon fluxes,"we investigated submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) associated nutrient fluxes and budgets in two coastal embayments, hwasun bay and bangdu bay, off the volcanic island of jeju, korea. sgd in hwasun bay is a composite of marine and meteoric groundwater, while that in bangdu bay mainly includes marine groundwater. the submarine inputs of groundwater into hwasun and bangdu bays were approximately 0.12 and 0.27 m(3) m( 2) d( 1), respectively, on the basis of the (222)rn mass balance models. the nitrogen : phosphorus ratios in coastal groundwater (85 +/  96) were considerably larger than those in the seawater (3.8 +/  1.6) of both bays. fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (din) through sgd were more than 90% of the net din input into both bays; approximately 93% and 39% of sgd driven din was consumed inside hwasun and bangdu bays, respectively. the discharge of din through sgd from the entire island was approximately 2.1 x 10(9) mol yr( 1), which is equivalent to that of some large rivers, potentially supporting approximately 1.6 x 10(11) g carbon yr( 1) of new primary production. because jeju accounts for less than 1% of the total land mass of the volcanic islands, sgd driven nutrient fluxes from highly permeable islands standing in oligotrophic oceans could be very important for global nutrient budgets."
Kim et al.,2018,Economic and Environmental Geology,"spatial temporal variations of nitrate levels in groundwater of jeju island, korea: evaluation of long term (1993 2015) monitoring data","the spatio temporal variations of nitrate concentrations in groundwater of jeju island were evaluated by an analysis of time series groundwater quality data (n = 21,568) that were collected from regional groundwater monitoring (number of wells = 4,835) for up to 20 years between 1993 and 2015. the median concentration of no3 n is 2.5 mg/l, which is slightly higher than those reported from regional surveys in other countries. nitrate concentrations of groundwater in wells tend to significantly vary according to different water usage (of the well), administrative districts, and topographic elevations: nitrate level is higher in low lying agricultural and residential areas than those in high mountainous areas. the mann kendall trend test and sen's slope analysis show that nitrate concentration in mid mountainous areas tends to increase, possibly due to the expansion of agricultural areas toward highland. on the other hand, nitrate concentrations in the specially designated groundwater quality protection zones show the temporally decreasing trend, which implies the efficiency of groundwater management actions in jeju. proper measures for sustainable groundwater quality management are suggested in this study."
Kim et al.,2011,Marine Chemistry,"large fluxes of rare earth elements through submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) from a volcanic island, jeju, korea","to evaluate the role of submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) as a source of rare earth elements (rees) in the coastal ocean, we estimated the sgd associated discharge of rees into two semi enclosed coastal bays off a volcanic island, jeju, korea. the coastal brackish groundwater showed pronounced enrichments of middle rees (mree) relative to light rees (lree) and heavy rees (hree) when normalized against the upper continental crust (ucc), whereas seawater samples outside the bays showed a hree enrichment pattern. the enrichment of both mree and hree was clearly identified in bay waters, resulting from mixing between groundwater and offshore seawater. the mass balances of rees demonstrated that the ree fluxes through sgd were two to three orders of magnitude higher than those that occurred through the other sources, such as diffusion from bottom sediments and atmospheric dust fallout. the sgd driven nd flux from the entire jeju island during this summer was approximately 120 +/  60 mol d( 1), which is comparable to the nd fluxes from major rivers (i.e., mississippi river). our results imply that highly permeable oceanic islands are particularly important for ree fluxes to the ocean.

Kim et al.,2015,Marine Chemistry,role of colloids in the discharge of trace elements and rare earth elements from coastal groundwater to the ocean,"the concentrations of both the total dissolved (<0.45 mu m) and colloidal (10 kda 0.45 mu m) phases of trace elements and rare earth elements (rees) in coastal groundwater were measured to evaluate the role of colloids in transporting trace elements and rees to the ocean through submarine groundwater discharge (sgd). samples were collected from two different hydrogeological conditions, hampyeong bay in the southwestern coast of korea and jeju island, korea. the average colloidal proportions of al, mn, zn, ni, cu, cd, pb, po 210, and pb 210 were 35 45% of the total dissolved phase, which were relatively higher than those of cr, fe, co, and rees (10 30%), although hydrogeological conditions were variable. most of the colloidal trace elements (including 210pb and rees), except mn, correlate most significantly with fe, indicating that their presence is dependent on fe containing oxide minerals in the subterranean estuary (ste). on the other hand, the colloidal mn and 210po correlated more significantly with dissolved organic carbon (doc), indicating that dissolved organic matter (dom) cycling associated with bacterial activity plays an important role in their presence in the colloidal phase in the ste. our results suggest that the fluxes of trace elements through sgd are greatly dependent on the presence of fe (for al, zn, ni, cu, cd, pb, and rees) and dom (for po 210 and mn) in coastal groundwater. 2015 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
Kim et al.,2012,Vadose Zone Journal,"a global analysis of groundwater recharge for vegetation, climate, and soils","because groundwater is an essential resource for people and ecosystems, a better understanding is needed of the fundamental controls on recharge and its interactions with vegetation change. we analyzed >600 estimates of groundwater recharge to obtain the first global analysis of recharge and vegetation types. globally, croplands had the highest proportion of water input (wi = precipitation + irrigation) that become recharge, followed by grasslands, woodlands, and scrublands (average proportional recharge: 0.11, 0.08, 0.06, and 0.05, respectively; p < 0.0001). a stepwise regression model revealed that wi had the strongest association with recharge overall, followed by vegetation type, potential evapotranspiration (pet), saturated hydraulic conductivity based on soil texture (k s), and seasonality of rainfall (r 2 = 0.29, 0.16, 0.12, 0.06, and 0.01, respectively; p < 0.0001). recharge increased with increasing wi, k s, and seasonality of rainfall and decreased with increasing pet. relative differences in recharge among vegetation types were larger in drier climates and clayey soils, indicating greater biological control on soil water fluxes under these conditions. to further test the relationship between recharge and vegetation, we compared global synthesis data to our parallel field estimates of recharge in paired grasslands, croplands, and woodlands across the argentinean pampas and the southwestern united states. our field estimates of recharge were similar to, and followed the same pattern of, recharge under vegetation types in the synthesis data, suggesting that landuse changes will continue to alter recharge dynamics and vadose zone processes globally. the results of this study highlight the implications of landuse management for sustainable groundwater use and should also help test and improve recharge estimates in large scale waterbalance and climate models."
Kim et al.,2013,Journal of Sea Research,"dissolved organic matter in the subterranean estuary of a volcanic island, jeju: importance of dissolved organic nitrogen fluxes to the ocean","we observed the origin, behavior, and flux of dissolved organic carbon (doc), dissolved organic nitrogen (don), colored dissolved organic matter (cdom), and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (din) in the subterranean estuary of a volcanic island, jeju, korea. the sampling of surface seawater and coastal groundwater was conducted in hwasun bay, jeju, in three sampling campaigns (october 2010, january 2011, and june 2011). we observed conservative mixing of these components in this subterranean environment for a salinity range from 0 to 32. the fresh groundwater was characterized by relatively high don, din, and cdom, while the marine groundwater showed relatively high doc. the don and din fluxes through submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) in the groundwater of hwasun bay were estimated to be 1.3 x 10(5) and 2.9 x 10(5) mol d( 1), respectively. in the seawater of hwasun bay, the groundwater origin don was almost conservative while about 91% of the groundwater origin din was removed perhaps due to biological production. the don flux from the entire jeju was estimated to be 7.9 x 10(8) mol yr( 1), which is comparable to some of the world's large rivers. thus, our study highlights that don flux through sgd is potentially important for delivery of organic nitrogen to further offshore while din is readily utilized by marine plankton in near shore waters under n limited conditions.

Kimani et al.,2016,International Journal of Marine and Coastal Law,the african union's role in the governance of offshore freshwater aquifers,"scientific insights have revealed the existence of undersea freshwater aquifers off the coasts of some african states and elsewhere, which present possibilities for exploitation. the question arises as to whether, or to what extent, the formal governance structures of the african union (au) and its relevant maritime strategic frameworks adequately provide for their regulatory oversight. the study highlights relevant provisions of the constitutive act of the african union and its related protocols, as well as the 2050 africa's integrated maritime strategy while the au could facilitate the development of pan african governing arrangements, important legal issues remain outstanding in relation to the applicable judicial mechanism, operationalizing agreed courses of action, facilitating access to technology, implementing appropriate environmental safeguards and clarifying landlocked states' rights. suggestions are also made for further study. addressing these issues could greatly facilitate efforts to design and optimise governing arrangements for the benefit of future generations."
King et al.,2015,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,identifying flood recharge and inter aquifer connectivity using multiple isotopes in subtropical australia,"an understanding of hydrological processes is vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources, especially in areas where an aquifer interacts with surfacewater systems or where aquifer interconnectivity occurs. this is particularly important in areas that are subjected to frequent drought/flood cycles, such as the cressbrook creek catchment in southeast queensland, australia. in order to understand the hydrological response to flooding and to identify inter aquifer connectivity, multiple isotopes (delta h 2, delta o 18, sr 87/sr 86, h 3 and c 14) were used in this study in conjunction with a comprehensive hydrochemical assessment, based on data collected 6 months after severe flooding in 2011. the relatively depleted stable isotope signatures of the flood generating rainfall (delta h 2:  30.2 to  27.8 parts per thousand, delta o 18:  5.34 to 5.13 parts per thousand vsmow) were evident in surfacewater samples (delta h 2:  25.2 to  23.2 parts per thousand, delta o 18:  3.9 to  3.6 parts per thousand vsmow), indicating that these extreme events were a major source of recharge to the dam in the catchment headwaters. furthermore, stable isotopes confirmed that the flood generated significant recharge to the alluvium in the lower part of the catchment, particularly in areas where interactions between surfacewaters and groundwater were identified and where diffuse aquifer recharge is normally limited by a thick (approximately 10 m) and relatively impermeable unsaturated zone. however, in the upper parts of the catchment where recharge generally occurs more rapidly due to the dominance of coarse grained sediments in the unsaturated zone, the stable isotope signature of groundwater resembles the longer term average rainfall values (delta h 2:  12.6, delta o 18:  3.4 parts per thousand vsmow), highlighting that recharge was sourced from smaller rainfall events that occurred subsequent to the flooding. interactions between the bedrock aquifers and the alluvium were identified at several sites in the lower part of the catchment based on sr 87/sr 86 ratios; this was also supported by the hydrochemical assessment, which included the modelling of evaporation trends and saturation indices. the integrated approach used in this study facilitated the identification of hydrological processes over different spatial and temporal scales, and the method can be applied to other complex geological settings with variable climatic conditions."
King et al.,2014,Hydrogeology Journal,"multivariate statistical analysis of hydrochemical data to assess alluvial aquifer stream connectivity during drought and flood: cressbrook creek, southeast queensland, australia","a catchment scale multivariate statistical analysis of hydrochemistry enabled assessment of interactions between alluvial groundwater and cressbrook creek, an intermittent drainage system in southeast queensland, australia. hierarchical cluster analyses and principal component analysis were applied to time series data to evaluate the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater during periods of extreme drought and severe flooding. a simple three dimensional geological model was developed to conceptualise the catchment morphology and the stratigraphic framework of the alluvium. the alluvium forms a two layer system with a basal coarse grained layer overlain by a clay rich low permeability unit. in the upper and middle catchment, alluvial groundwater is chemically similar to streamwater, particularly near the creek (reflected by high hco3/cl and k/na ratios and low salinities), indicating a high degree of connectivity. in the lower catchment, groundwater is more saline with lower hco3/cl and k/na ratios, notably during dry periods. groundwater salinity substantially decreased following severe flooding in 2011, notably in the lower catchment, confirming that flooding is an important mechanism for both recharge and maintaining groundwater quality. the integrated approach used in this study enabled effective interpretation of hydrological processes and can be applied to a variety of hydrological settings to synthesise and evaluate large hydrochemical datasets."

Kiparsky et al.,2017,Water,the importance of institutional design for distributed local level governance of groundwater: the case of california's sustainable groundwater management act,"in many areas of the world, groundwater resources are increasingly stressed, and unsustainable use has become common. where existing mechanisms for governing groundwater are ineffective or nonexistent, new ones need to be developed. local level groundwater governance provides an intriguing alternative to top down models, with the promise of enabling management to better match the diversity of physical and social conditions in groundwater basins. one such example is emerging in california, usa, where new state law requires new local agencies to self organize and act to achieve sustainable groundwater management. in this article, we draw on insights from research on common pool resource management and natural resources governance to develop guidelines for institutional design for local groundwater governance, grounded in california's developing experience. we offer nine criteria that can be used as principles or standards in the evaluation of institutional design for local level groundwater governance: scale, human capacity, funding, authority, independence, representation, participation, accountability, and transparency. we assert that local governance holds promise as an alternative to centralized governance in some settings but that its success will depend heavily on the details of its implementation. further, for local implementation to achieve its promise, there remain important complementary roles for centralized governance. california's developing experience with local level groundwater management in dozens of basins across the state provides a unique opportunity to test and assess the importance and influence of these criteria."
Kirby et al.,2015,Agricultural Water Management,the impact of irrigation development on regional groundwater resources in bangladesh,"there is increasing concern over falling groundwater levels in some areas of bangladesh, and there is undoubted overuse of groundwater in the barind tract in northwest bangladesh and around dhaka. however, the volumes of water availability and use, and hence the sustainability of use, are not well known. we developed monthly waterbalances for the main regions of bangladesh to investigate historic trends in water use and availability and possible future trends under changed management to lessen groundwater use by using more surfacewater for irrigation. our results show that for many areas the fall in pre monsoon groundwater levels (at the regional average level) over the last few decades may be largely explained by the continual withdrawal of ever greater volumes of water with the three fold increase in the area of irrigation. thus, for many areas, if there were no further increase in the area irrigated by groundwater, the rate of decline in groundwater levels would likely reduce and levels could even attain a new equilibrium at a lower level, implying that current pumping rates could be maintained (subject to the lower groundwater levels being acceptable on environmental, economic and social grounds). post monsoon grodndwater levels are largely influenced by yearly rainfall variability. thus, groundwater use in some areas may not be as unsustainable as feared, and policies to reduce groundwater use in such areas may not be as necessary or urgent as thought. however, our analysis is approximate and detailed local studies are required to assess the sustainability of use.

Knight et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,the onshore influence of offshore fresh groundwater,"freshwater contained within the submarine extensions of coastal aquifers is increasingly proposed as a freshwater source for coastal communities. however, the extent to which offshore freshwater supports onshore pumping is currently unknown on a global scale. this study provides the first attempt to examine the likely prevalence of situations where offshore freshwater influences onshore salinities, considering various sites from around the world. the groundwater conditions in twenty seven confined and semi confined coastal aquifers with plausible connections to inferred or observed offshore freshwater are explored. the investigation uses available onshore salinities and groundwater levels, and offshore salinity knowledge, in combination with analytical modelling, to develop simplified conceptual models of the study sites. seven different conceptual models are proposed based on the freshwater saltwater extent and insights gained from analytical modelling. we consider both present day and pre development conditions in assessing potential modern contributions to offshore fresh groundwater. conceptual models also include interpretations of whether offshore freshwater is a significant factor influencing onshore salinities and well pumping sustainability. the results indicate that onshore water levels have declined between pre development and present day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions for which pre development data are available. estimates of the associated steady state freshwater extents show the potential for considerable offshore fresh groundwater losses accompanying these declines. both present day and pre development heads are insufficient to account for the observed offshore freshwater in all cases where adequate data exist. this suggests that paleo freshwater and/or aquifer heterogeneities contribute significantly to offshore freshwater extent. present day heads indicate that active seawater intrusion (swi) will eventually impact onshore pumping wells at fourteen of the twenty seven sites, while passive swi is expected onshore in an additional ten regions. albeit the number of field sites is limited, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that when offshore freshwater has an onshore linkage, it is being mined either passively or actively by onshore use. thus, offshore freshwater should be assessed in coastal waterbalances presuming that it serves as an existing freshwater input, rather than as a new potential freshwater resource.

Knight et al.,2018,Groundwater,mapping aquifer systems with airborne electromagnetics in the central valley of california,"the passage of the sustainable groundwater management act in california has highlighted a need for cost effective ways to acquire the data used in building conceptual models of the aquifer systems in the central valley of california. one approach would be the regional implementation of the airborne electromagnetic (aem) method. we acquired 104 line kilometers of data in the tulare irrigation district, in the central valley, to determine the depth of investigation (doi) of the aem method, given the abundance of electrically conductive clays, and to assess the usefulness of the method for mapping the hydrostratigraphy. the data were high quality providing, through inversion of the data, models displaying the variation in electrical resistivity to a depth of approximately 500 m. in order to transform the resistivity models to interpreted sections displaying lithology, we established the relationship between resistivity and lithology using collocated lithology logs (from drillers' logs) and aem data. we modeled the aem response and employed a bootstrapping approach to solve for the range of values in the resistivity model corresponding to sand and gravel, mixed coarse and fine, and clay in the unsaturated and saturated regions. the comparison between the resulting interpretation and an existing cross section demonstrates that aem can be an effective method for mapping the large scale hydrostratigraphy of aquifer systems in the central valley. the methods employed and developed in this study have widespread application in the use of the aem method for groundwater management in similar geologic settings."
Knuppe et al.,2011,Water Sa,the challenges facing sustainable and adaptive groundwater management in south africa,"long term population growth and economic development are placing ever increasing pressure on south africa's freshwater supply. on the basis of the current climate change predictions, which often entail uncertain consequences for aquifer systems and the associated groundwater goods and services, it is expected that the stress on water will increase even further. currently, south africa's groundwater governance regime does not provide the capacity to assure effective and sustainable resource regulation and allocation. to date, the management of groundwater is hampered by a variety of uncertainties, such as global climate change and socio economic growth, as well as ineffective governance structures affecting resource use, regulation, protection and the implementation of alternative strategies needed to achieve sustainable management. this paper presents the results of a qualitative assessment of interviews conducted with experts in south africa. four key challenges are identified to the development of adaptive and sustainable groundwater management and the successful implementation of current water legislation in south africa. these are: the undervaluation of groundwater importance and significance; the need for expertise and information at all scales; the centralisation of power; and the disregard of ecosystems and the associated goods and services. as a means to tackle these challenges, it has been assumed that the concept of adaptive water management represents a suitable approach to governing groundwater resources, by taking into account complex system linkages between hydrogeological, political, socio economic and environmental domains. supporting principles, such as tools for cooperation, participation and information networks, have been developed to facilitate the implementation of adaptive water management approaches and hence to achieve institutional change in the political arena of groundwater management."
Knuppe et al.,2011,Water Resources Management,a framework for the analysis of governance structures applying to groundwater resources and the requirements for the sustainable management of associated ecosystem services,"the competing demands placed on groundwater for socio economic and for ecological benefits, and the resultant tradeoffs, represent a major challenge for the management arena. the governance of groundwater resources and the sustainable management of associated ecosystem services must take into consideration human and biophysical characteristics as intertwined systems. frameworks and analytical tools are required to help understand complex governance regimes, and the linkages between management and the corresponding effects on ecosystem services. presented in this paper is a framework for the analysis of groundwater governance based on the adaptivemanagement approach and the ecosystem services concept. governance can be analyzed on the basis of certain characteristics. one characteristic of a governance regime assumed to be crucial for adaptive and sustainable management is vertical integration, which refers to the connectedness of different administrative levels, including the involvement of non governmental stakeholders in decision making and planning processes. the framework was applied in the upper guadiana basin in spain, where the intensive use of groundwater has led to significant conflicts between farmers, authorities and environmental conservation groups. the analysis showed that conflicts arose from a lack of vertical integration; e.g., one way communication between official authorities and the exclusion of local stakeholders during planning processes. the framework is deemed to be a strong analytical tool as it provides a basis for organized and context specific case study assessment and renders complex groundwater management more transparent and comprehensible. the framework will be further applied and enhanced for application in international case studies."
Knuppe et al.,2013,Regional Environmental Change,"requirements for adaptive governance of groundwater ecosystem services: insights from sandveld (south africa), upper guadiana (spain) and spree (germany)","the over abstraction of aquifers and the modification of landscape water systems often result in the degradation of groundwater resources and the loss of related ecosystem services. many of these problems are associated with failure of governance and management regimes. thus, groundwater resources require innovative approaches that deal with system complexity moving governments toward adaptive and integrated management. vertical (hierarchical) and horizontal (cross sectoral) integration structures are crucial characteristics of adaptive governance and support sustainable management of groundwater ecosystem services. the research objective of this article is to investigate linkages between these integration structures, the governance regime and the state of groundwater ecosystem services across three case studies: sandveld (south africa), upper guadiana (spain) and spree (germany). first, we developed a set of criteria indicating vertical and horizontal integration and then applied a conceptual and analytical approach, the management and transition framework, specifically developed to support a systematic and consistent investigation of policy and management processes. results indicate that higher degrees of integration during management activities do not identify a direct improvement of groundwater ecosystem services. but evidence highlights that integration (1) opens up the political arena for environmental perspectives, (2) increases the quality of groundwater and conservation plans, (3) accelerates the implementation of policies, (4) mitigates conflicts between different groundwater users and (5) increases the awareness of different ecosystem services. finally, we conclude that compared with other natural resources, groundwater management still lacks participation, multi level interactions and sectoral integration, especially at higher levels of management."
Knuppe et al.,2016,Environmental Policy and Governance,sustainable groundwater management: a comparative study of local policy changes and ecosystem services in south africa and germany,"groundwater dependent ecosystem services provide benefits to human well being and play a key role in regulating ecosystem processes and functions. improving groundwater management is of fundamental importance to reduce ecological trade offs and to avoid long term negative consequences for societies. in this context, local groundwater policies as well as multi level governance processes play a key role. this article provides an improved understanding of how local policies change in response to social ecological drivers and how these changes contribute to the sustainable provision of groundwater dependent ecosystem services. within this context, we analyze recent changes in local groundwater policies in the sandveld region (south africa) and the spreewald region (germany) from a multi level governance perspective. in both cases a combination of drivers   in particular ecological degradation experienced at the local level and socio political transformation   led to changes of local groundwater policies. a positive impact of these changes is expected, but not yet visible. the studied policies consider the complexity of groundwater functions and the different users depending on them. however, they do not explicitly mention ecosystem services and ignore important ecological processes and functions. therefore, we conclude that groundwater management could become more sustainable by taking ecosystem services and stakeholder interests more explicitly into account in local policy processes. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd and erp environment"
Kohlhepp et al.,2017,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"aquifer configuration and geostructural links control the groundwater quality in thin bedded carbonate siliciclastic alternations of the hainich cze, central germany","the quality of near surface groundwater reservoirs is controlled, but also threatened, by manifold surface subsurface interactions. vulnerability studies typically evaluate the variable interplay of surface factors (land management, infiltration patterns) and subsurface factors (hydrostratigraphy, flow properties) in a thorough way, but disregard the resulting groundwater quality. conversely, hydrogeochemical case studies that address the chemical evolution of groundwater often lack a comprehensive analysis of the structural buildup. in this study, we aim to reconstruct the actual spatial groundwater quality pattern from a synoptic analysis of the hydrostratigraphy, lithostratigraphy, pedology and landuse in the hainich critical zone exploratory (hainich cze). this cze represents a widely distributed yet scarcely described setting of thin bedded mixed carbonatesiliciclastic strata in hillslope terrains. at the eastern hainich low mountain hillslope, bedrock is mainly formed by alternated marine sedimentary rocks of the upper muschelkalk (middle triassic) that partly host productive groundwater resources. spatial patterns of the groundwater quality of a 5.4 km long well transect are derived by principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. aquifer stratigraphy and geostructural links were deduced from lithological drill core analysis, mineralogical analysis, geophysical borehole logs and mapping data. maps of preferential recharge zones and recharge potential were deduced from digital (soil) mapping, soil survey data and field measurements of soil hydraulic conductivities (k s). by attributing spatially variable surface and subsurface conditions, we were able to reconstruct groundwater quality clusters that reflect the type of land management in their preferential recharge areas, aquifer hydraulic conditions and cross formational exchange via caprock sinkholes or ascending flow. generally, the aquifer configuration (spatial arrangement of strata, valley incision/outcrops) and related geostructural links (enhanced recharge areas, karst phenomena) control the role of surface factors (input quality and locations) vs. subsurface factors (water rock interaction, cross formational flow) for groundwater quality in the multi layered aquifer system. our investigation reveals general properties of alternating sequences in hillslope terrains that are prone to forming multilayered aquifer systems. this synoptic analysis is fundamental and indispensable for a mechanistic understanding of ecological functioning, sustainable resource management and protection."
Komakech et al.,2018,Water Alternatives-an Interdisciplinary Journal on Water Politics and Development,differentiated access: challenges of equitable and sustainable groundwater exploitation in tanzania,"groundwater is an important resource for a large share of the global population and economies. although groundwater dependence in most sub saharan african countries is relatively low at the national level, localized overexploitation is occurring, leading to a decline in groundwater levels and quality deterioration. currently, the sustainable and equitable governance of groundwater, both through promotion and regulation, is turning out to be a key challenge in many sub saharan african countries. this paper uses case studies of urban groundwater governance in arusha, and rural groundwater development in the pangani basin, to analyse how the current policy and regulation inadvertently creates spaces for asymmetric access to (good quality) groundwater resources in tanzania. it shows how the groundwater landscape is evolving into a situation where small users (farmers and households) rely on springs and shallow wells, while large users (commercial users and urban water authorities) are encouraged to sink deep boreholes. amidst a lack of knowledge and enforcing capacity, exacerbated by different priorities among government actors, the water access rights of shallow well and spring users are being threatened by increased groundwater exploitation. hence, the current groundwater policy and institutional setup do not only empower larger actors to gain disproportionate access to the groundwater resources, but presents this as a benefit for small users whose water security will supposedly increase."
Konikow et al.,2014,Groundwater,"depletion and capture: revisiting ""the source of water derived from wells''","a natural consequence of groundwater withdrawals is the removal of water from subsurface storage, but the overall rates and magnitude of groundwater depletion and capture relative to groundwater withdrawals (extraction or pumpage) have not previously been well characterized. this study assesses the partitioning of long term cumulative withdrawal volumes into fractions derived from storage depletion and capture, where capture includes both increases in recharge and decreases in discharge. numerical simulation of a hypothetical groundwater basin is used to further illustrate some of theis' (1940) principles, particularly when capture is constrained by insufficient available water. most prior studies of depletion and capture have assumed that capture is unconstrained through boundarycondition that yield linear responses. examination of real systems indicates that capture and depletion fractions are highly variable in time and space. for a large sample of long developed groundwater systems, the depletion fraction averages about 0.15 and the capture fraction averages about 0.85 based on cumulative volumes. higher depletion fractions tend to occur in more arid regions, but the variation is high and the correlation coefficient between average annual precipitation and depletion fraction for individual systems is only 0.40. because 85% of long term pumpage is derived from capture in these real systems, capture must be recognized as a critical factor in assessing waterbudgets, groundwater storage depletion, and sustainability of groundwater development. most capture translates into streamflow depletion, so it can detrimentally impact ecosystems."
Kotchoni et al.,2019,Hydrogeology Journal,relationships between rainfall and groundwater recharge in seasonally humid benin: a comparative analysis of long term hydrographs in sedimentary and crystalline aquifers,"groundwater is a vital source of freshwater throughout the tropics enabling access to safe water for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes close to the point of demand. the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals is controlled, in part, by groundwater recharge, yet the conversion of rainfall into recharge remains inadequately understood, particularly in the tropics. this study examines a rare set of 19 25 year records of observed groundwater levels and rainfall under humid conditions (mean rainfall is similar to 1,200mmyear( 1)) in three common geological environments of benin and other parts of west africa: quaternary sands, mio pliocene sandstone, and crystalline rocks. recharge is estimated from groundwater level fluctuations and employs values of specific yield derived from magnetic resonance soundings. recharge is observed to occur seasonally and linearly in response to rainfall exceeding an apparent threshold of between 140 and 250mmyear( 1). inter annual changes in groundwater storage correlate well to inter annual rainfall variability. however, recharge varies substantially depending upon the geological environment: annual recharge to shallow aquifers of quaternary sands amounts to as much as 40% of annual rainfall, whereas in deeper aquifers of mio pliocene sandstone and weathered crystalline rocks, annual fractions of rainfall generating recharge are 13 and 4%, respectively. differences are primarily attributed to the thickness of the unsaturated zone and to the lithological controls on the transmission and storage of rain fed recharge."
Kourakos et al.,2015,Hydrogeology Journal,an efficient simulation optimization coupling for management of coastal aquifers,"seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers is a major environmental problem and efficient tools are needed to assist decision making. decision tools are often simulation models (which evaluate probable actions) combined with optimization algorithms (which search for optimum management decisions). a coupling between simulation models and optimization algorithms for management of coastal aquifers is presented. the simulation models are based on the sharp interface approximation where the decision variables do not affect the discretized system matrix. for such problems, a transformation of the system matrix prior to optimization is proposed which supports rapid solution of the linear system of equations during the optimization stage, for different values of decision variables. the method is applied to a hypothetical simulation of a coastal aquifer on the greek island of santorini, where the proposed simulation optimization coupling method is employed to maximize pumping rates subject to environmental constraints that protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion. various packages were tested in order to investigate their efficiency in solving the linear system pertinent to the case study. the proposed method, based on coupling of equations, is found to be very efficient in terms of computational cost. in particular, for the problem examined, it is at least 50 times faster than standard methods, depending on the grid size."
Kovarik et al.,2017,Environmental Earth Sciences,"groundwater vulnerability mapping for a sub catchment of the rio la venta watershed, chiapas, mexico","karst systems are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation and pollution due to their high hydraulic conductivity and points of rapid infiltration that allow quick influx of runoff and pollutants into the aquifer. the sustainability of non contaminated groundwater in these systems is imperative for both humans and groundwater dependent ecosystems. an important practice in managing groundwater sustainability involves assessing aquifer vulnerability. this study created the first groundwater vulnerability map (gvm) for a sub catchment of the rio la venta watershed in chiapas, mexico, using an adaptation of the hazard pathway target method. this project also conducted the first tracer study in the rio la venta watershed to establish connectivity between the catchment and the rio la venta canyon. finally, this study evaluated the results of the gvm through a sensitivityanalysis. results of the gvm clearly demarcate areas of very high, high, moderate, and low vulnerability within the study area most of which being classified as low vulnerability. the zones of high vulnerability were successfully validated through two dye tracer tests that measured rapid groundwater flow velocities. with the limited resources available to land managers in this area, a problem common in many developing countries, tools that quickly and inexpensively highlight areas that require special protection to help maintain or improve water quality in their watersheds have great utility. conveying this information to land managers and policymakers can lead to potential changes in current landuse practices and allow for the reallocation of resources in support of reducing future negative human landscape interactions."
Krogulec et al.,2018,Ecohydrology & Hydrobiology,"evaluating the risk of groundwater drought in groundwater dependent ecosystems in the central part of the vistula river valley, poland","the objective of this study was to seek better insight into the natural factors that may contribute to hydrogeological drought in shallow hydrogeological ecosystems that exhibit significant seasonal and multiannual groundwater level dynamics. with this aim, we monitored groundwater levels in two groundwater dependent ecosystems (gdes) situated close together in the central part of the vistula valley regularly at 14 day intervals over a long term period (1999 2013), using a monitoring network of 17 piezometers of the monitoring network (recording about 6600 observations overall). the piezometers were situated such that they were not under the direct influence of anthropopressure, thus allowing the results to be interpreted as the influence of natural factors on the quantitative state of gdes. we found that the groundwater level changes over the study period can be classified as exhibiting hydroperiods of the periodic type, with a typical seasonal level fluctuation pattern, without any distinct long term trend. statistical analysis showed that hydrogeological droughts, characteristic of the summer months, occur only during years when the lowest groundwater levels were observed. shallow hydrogeological droughts occur periodically, from summer to spring, and the average duration of shallow droughts was 8 weeks. overall, this study illustrates how analysis of groundwater level fluctuations in gdes on multiannual and seasonal scales, determining the fluctuation trends and the values of critical levels, provides better understanding of the risk of groundwater drought hazard and occurrence. assessment of the natural range of groundwater level fluctuations can then assist in effecting better local water resource management and may aid agricultural organizations and development/planning authorities to improve their understanding of sustainable groundwater resource management.

Kulcsar et al.,2016,Journal of Rural Studies,privileged access and rural vulnerabilities: examining social and environmental exploitation in bioenergy development in the american midwest,"negative environmental externalities typically emerge in rural areas due to urban centers' privileged access to the rural hinterland for economic activities related to the extraction and processing of natural resources. less attention has been given to those cases when both the promotion of economic activities and their consequential inequalities are driven from within rural communities themselves. privileged accounts within communities naturalize environmental concerns and divert attention from the inequalities associated with the costs and risks of economic development. within this context, it is important to examine local perceptions, framings, and power structures that create and perpetuate asymmetries in access to natural resources for economic development and the local vulnerabilities they create. drawing on freudenberg's theory of privileged access and privileged accounts, this paper examines the promotion and development of biofuels plants in the rural american midwest. here, proponents of biofuels development argued that biofuel facilities were ideally suited to local conditions, where large scale corn production, the main biomass input, is extensive. drawing on data from surveys of six case study communities in rural kansas and iowa, augmented by in depth stakeholder interviews, we discuss the local support towards biofuels production in the context of environmental concerns. the results indicate significant rural community support despite evidence that the contribution of biofuels production to local livelihoods was minimal. we show how these privileged accounts create largely unified support locally for biofuels production and quiescence concerning the disproportionality of benefits, potential environmental harms and long term development challenges.

Kumar et al.,2016,Iim Kozhikode Society & Management Review,distressed elephants: policy initiatives for sustainable groundwater management in india,"this article reviews the dominant arguments which shaped public policies in the agricultural groundwater sector in india. it also examines the initiatives to arrest groundwater depletion. it is a synthesis of the research carried out by the author over the last two decades and review of the work by others. following were the arguments that shaped public policies in the agricultural groundwater sector in india, as per the review: high density of farm wells in remote areas increases the transaction cost of metering and charging for electricity on a pro rata basis, as a tool to control groundwater draft; groundwater economy is controlled by small and marginal farmers, and attempts to regulate it are politically sensitive; and raising power tariff would adversely affect farmers who buy water. furthermore, the regions with high density of wells do not experience intensive groundwater use; groundwater economy is mainly controlled by large farmers. in water abundant regions, subsidized power does not reduce the monopoly of water sellers; in water scarce regions, an increase in power tariff would have only marginal effect on it; and, in semi arid regions, raising farm power tariff would result in improved efficiency, equity and sustainability in groundwater use and would be socio economically viable. in water scarce regions, the large public funds spent for watershed management, dug well recharging and community based water harvesting produce no positive outcomes. attempts to introduce electricity pricing or groundwater taxes or water rights are absent. schemes promoting the use of micro irrigation do raise farm productivity, but leave no incentive among farmers to reduce water use."
Kumar et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,inducing the shift from flat rate or free agricultural power to metered supply: implications for groundwater depletion and power sector viability in india,"india's farm sector sustains livelihoods for hundreds of millions of rural people, but faces serious management challenges for land, water, and energy resources. growing dependence on groundwater threatens water resources sustainability and power sector viability. sustaining india's rising prosperity rests on managing groundwater. this study shows that raising power tariffs in the farm sector to achieve efficiency and sustainability of groundwater use is both socially and economically viable. the question is about how to introduce this shift. this paper discusses five different options for power supply, metering and energy pricing in the farm sector and the expected outcomes of implementing each vis a vis efficiency of groundwater and energy use, equity in access and sustainability of groundwater. it concludes that establishing an energy quota for each farm based on sustainability considerations, and metering and charging pro rata for power used are the best options to manage groundwater and the energy economy.

Kumar et al.,2013,Journal of the Indian Institute of Science,urban water supply and management,"population growth and rapid urbanization lead to considerable stress on already depleting water resources. a great challenge for water authorities of urban cities is to supply adequate and reliable safe water to all consumers. in most of the developing countries water scarcity and high demands have led the water authorities to resort to intermittent supplies. surface and groundwater are the major sources of supply in urban cities. the direct consequences of intermittent supplies and poor sanitation practices are several incidences of water borne diseases posing public health risk. in order to minimize the supply demand gap and to assure good quality of water, new techniques or models can be helpful to manage the water distribution systems (wds) in a better way. in the present paper, a review is carried out on the existing urban water supply management methodologies with a way forward for the proper management of the water supply systems."
Kumar et al.,2013,Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering,integrated modeling framework to evaluate conjunctive use options in a canal irrigated area,"in canal irrigated areas, where interactions between surfacewater and groundwater are high, the conjunctive management of surfacewater and groundwater can play a significant role in improving water availability in time and space, thereby promoting more equitable distribution of water while maintaining long term availability of groundwater resources. achieving a harmonious balance between the use of surfacewater and groundwater requires careful consideration of the associated benefits, impacts, and trade offs. in this study, a simple, integrated framework was developed and implemented to characterize and quantify interactions between surfacewater and groundwater in a canal irrigated area; this framework was used to evaluate the impacts of alternative levels of conjunctive use under varying climate and cropping conditions. applying the model to a case study area of the srisailam right branch canal project in andhra pradesh, india, indicated that regulating canal supplies to optimum levels can prompt sustainable groundwater use and save up to 48% of allocated canal water; these water savings could be reallocated elsewhere within the irrigated area to promote equity."

Laghari et al.,2012,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,the indus basin in the framework of current and future water resources management,"the indus basin is one of the regions in the world that is faced with major challenges for its water sector, due to population growth, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, environmental degradation, unregulated utilization of the resources, inefficient water use and poverty, all aggravated by climate change. the indus basin is shared by 4 countries   pakistan, india, afghanistan and china. with a current population of 237 million people which is projected to increase to 319 million in 2025 and 383 million in 2050, already today water resources are abstracted almost entirely (more than 95% for irrigation). climate change will result in increased water availability in the short term. however in the long term water availability will decrease. some current aspects in the basin need to be re evaluated. during the past decades water abstractions   and especially groundwater extractions   have augmented continuously to support a rice wheat system where rice is grown during the kharif (wet, summer) season (as well as sugar cane, cotton, maize and other crops) and wheat during the rabi (dry, winter) season. however, the sustainability of this system in its current form is questionable. additional water for domestic and industrial purposes is required for the future and should be made available by a reduction in irrigation requirements. this paper gives a comprehensive listing and description of available options for current and future sustainable water resources management (wrm) within the basin. sustainable wrm practices include both water supply management and water demand management options. water supply management options include: (1) reservoir management as the basin is characterised by a strong seasonal behaviour in water availability (monsoon and meltwater) and water demands; (2) water quality conservation and investment in wastewater infrastructure; (3) the use of alternative water resources like the recycling of wastewater and desalination; (4) landuse planning and soil conservation as well as flood management, with a focus on the reduction of erosion and resulting sedimentation as well as the restoration of ecosystem services like wetlands and natural floodplains. water demand management options include: (1) the management of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater; as well as (2) the rehabilitation and modernization of existing infrastructure. other demand management options are: (3) the increase of water productivity for agriculture; (4) crop planning and diversification including the critical assessment of agricultural export, especially (basmati) rice; (5) economic instruments and (6) changing food demand patterns and limiting post harvest losses."
Lamban et al.,2011,Environmental Earth Sciences,application of groundwater sustainability indicators to the carbonate aquifer of the sierra de becerrero (southern spain),"the objective of this study was to test the applicability of groundwater sustainability indicators defined by unesco, together with the international academy of environmental sciences (iaes), the international association of hydrogeology (iah) group on groundwater indicators and the geological survey of spain (igme), to the aquifer scale. we selected four main indicators based on their relevance in the field of groundwater sustainability and because they proved to be the most reliable, based on the data collection and methodology utilized. these indicators were applied to a small 26 km(2) of permeable outcrops carbonate aquifer situated in the province of seville (southern spain), which has semi arid climate conditions (500 mm/year). the integral application of all these indicators in this particular groundwater body leads us to conclude that, at present, the aquifer is undergoing intensive use. therefore, the exploitation of its water resources is surpassing the threshold of sustainability when both the quantity and the quality of the groundwater are taken into consideration. the continued increase in exploitation generates a descending trend in the evolution of the piezometric levels, a consequence of adaptation to the new hydrodynamic situation, and also results in exhaustion of the springs that drain the aquifer in undisturbed conditions. at the same time, there is a trend of increasing salinity in the groundwater and a risk of contamination by nitrate which, according to the eu water framework directive and the groundwater daughter directive (eu official journal of the european communities l327, 2000; eu official journal of the european communities l372/19, 2006), should be controlled and reduced. in the future, application of the methodology described here may prove useful for the evaluation of similar systems, either in southern spain or in other countries with semi arid climates."
Langridge et al.,2018,Water Alternatives-an Interdisciplinary Journal on Water Politics and Development,comparative analysis of institutions to govern the groundwater commons in california,"the management of groundwater, a common pool resource, is a fundamental collective action problem that can lead to overexploitation. our paper examines the management of two groundwater basins in california's central coast region whose geographic proximity, landuse patterns, socioeconomic characteristics, and timing of institutional formation provide an ideal basis for comparative study. however, each basin is governed by a distinctive institutional configuration. the pajaro valley water management agency is a legislatively created special act district with a collective public management focus, while the santa paula groundwater basin is managed through a court adjudication with a rights based focus. we compare the legal and administrative foundations of these institutional arrangements and examine their implications for the polycentric regulation of sustainable groundwater use. we find that while adjudication may specify groundwater rights, an approach that scholars argue can be critical for achieving sustainability, it also promotes insularity with a wider polycentric system and this ultimately limits its management strategies. the special act district, by contrast, does not encourage as clear an allocation of water rights, but does encourage a broad sustainability mission and wider polycentric engagement, though it still struggles with declining groundwater levels. ultimately, neither institutional arrangement fully addresses the problem of groundwater sustainability. this suggests the need for further research on how institutional configurations and developmental pathways impact resource outcomes."
Langridge et al.,2017,Water Resources Management,accounting for climate change and drought in implementing sustainable groundwater management,"groundwater provides close to 40% of california's overall water supply under average hydrologic conditions. it is a critical source of backup during drought when increased pumping occurs to compensate for reduced surface supplies and decreased soil moisture. the conundrum is that in regions of the state where groundwater dependence is already high and rates of recharge are low, over the long term the volume withdrawn, particularly during droughts, generally exceeds replenishment in many regions. the result is overdraft   ongoing declines in groundwater levels over the long term. to facilitate the reduction or cessation of long term groundwater overdraft, this paper proposes that sustainable groundwater management must include the development of a drought reserve. the reserve, ideally sourced, sited and used locally, would encompass sufficient water for use during a drought such that the increased withdrawals during a drought do not result in unrecoverable groundwater declines and concomitant negative impacts. the objective is to reduce vulnerability to the state's periodic droughts, as opposed to mitigating seasonal variations in precipitation. this paper first summarizes the issues associated with developing drought reserves, and then examines in detail how two california groundwater management agencies approach establishing and implementing a drought reserve."
Langroodi et al.,2015,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,spatial and temporal variability analysis of groundwater quantity to landuse/land cover change in the khanmirza agricultural plain in iran,"understanding landuse/cover change (lucc) and groundwater resources is important for landuse planning and natural resource management. the development of agriculture has encouraged farmers in the khanmirza plain in iran to increase the number of agricultural wells and irrigated land over the past three decades. this has caused a continual decrease in groundwater level which threatens life in the groundwater aquifer reservoir. the present study used integrated spatiotemporal analysis to monitor changes in groundwater quantity and lucc for sustainable resource management in khanmirza plain. luccs were extracted using landsat tm data, and groundwater quantity changes were generated for the piezometric and agricultural wells. the periods of analysis were 1987 2000, 2000 2010, and 1987 2010. decision tree classification, ancillary data, and post classification comparison processing was used to classify the images and luccs. results showed that irrigated land increased by approximately 1350 ha and agricultural landscapes trended toward integrated land between 1987 and 2000. the most remarkable change occurred between 2000 and 2010, when the total irrigated land decreased gradually to about 1126 ha and rain fed agriculture increased. the sharp drop in groundwater of from 7.17 to 39.1 m in this region decreased available meadow land to 1000 ha between 1987 and 2010, which decreased the area of potential agricultural land. consequently, fragmentation of landuse occurred throughout the period. these changes have produced devastating effects on different parts of the study area."
Lanzoni et al.,2018,Applied Geochemistry,groundwater in sudan: an improved understanding of wadi directed recharge,"like many dryland regions around the world, the butana region of sudan is almost entirely dependent on groundwater, and its main source of recharge comes from the highly variable 150 200 mm/yr rain that arrives mostly during a three month rainy season. these rains cause ephemeral wadis to flow and flood, and provide a critical component of shallow aquifer replenishment. this study uses watertable fluctuations along a 20 km wadi reach and chemical and stable isotopic tracers in 27 shallow (< 40 m) and 6 deep (70 170 m) wells to show differences between mean recharge in the alluvial aquifer, estimated as 38 105 mm/yr, and the basal nubian sandstone aquifer unit at 13 36 mm/yr. this study suggests while groundwater from the nubian sandstone is predominantly palaeowater of  8 to  6 parts per thousand delta o 18 formed during a wetter, early holocene climate, modern recharge does reach the nubian sandstone aquifer unit in areas < 0.3 km from the wadi. an upstream dam may also focus this wadi directed recharge. in the 1980s, conjunctive use of major and trace geochemistry, isotope, and physical hydrology in the study of wadi recharge was only beginning to gain traction as a sub discipline, and the study of edmunds et al. (1987) in the abu delaig area paved the way for hydrogeochemical studies in unmonitored dryland catchments around the world. thirty years on from that study, the local population has grown tenfold, water extraction has increased to accommodate mining, and an upstream dam has been built. this study, conducted in a 400 km(2) subset of the original lower atbara basin study, answers a previously unanswered question about wadi recharge to the deeper, nubian sandstone aquifer unit and offers a unique three decade perspective on groundwater development in a rural, arid environment expanding beyond its margin of groundwater sustainability."

Lathashri et al.,2016,Journal of Earth System Science,groundwater sustainability assessment in coastal aquifers,"the present work investigates the response of shallow, coastal unconfined aquifers to anticipated overdraft conditions and climate change effect using numerical simulation. the groundwater flow model modflow and variable density groundwater model seawat are used for this investigation. the transmissivity and specific yield estimated from the existing database range from 10 to 810 m (2)/day and 0.08% to 10.92% respectively. after successful calibration with nash sutcliffe efficiency greater than 0.80, the values of horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the unconfined aquifer were set in the range 1.85 61.90 m/day and 0.006 0.24 respectively. after validating the model, it is applied for forecasting the aquifer's response to anticipated future scenarios of groundwater draft, recharge rate and sea level rise. the findings of the study illustrate that saltwater intrusion is intensified in the area adjoining the tidal rivers, rather than that due to the sea alone. of all the scenarios simulated, the immense negative impact on groundwater quality emerges due to overdraft conditions and reduced recharge with the areal extent of seawater intrusion exceeding about 67% (tds > 1 kg/m (3)). the study also arrives at the conclusion that, regional sea level rise of 1 mm/year has no impact on the groundwater dynamics of the aquifer."
Lathashri et al.,2016,Journal of Environmental Engineering,predictive simulation of seawater intrusion in a tropical coastal aquifer,"the solute transport in a tropical, coastal aquifer of southern india is numerically simulated considering the possible cases of aquifer recharge, freshwater draft, and seawater intrusion using numerical modeling software. the aquifer considered for the study is a shallow, unconfined aquifer with lateritic formations having good monsoon rains up to about 3,000mm during june to september and the rest of the months almost dry. the model is calibrated for a two year period and validated against the available dataset, which gave satisfactory results. the groundwater flow pattern during the calibration period shows that for the month of may a depleted watertable and during the monsoon month of august a saturated watertable was predicted. the sensitivityanalysis of model parameters reveals that the hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate are the most sensitive parameters. based on seasonal investigation, the seawater intrusion is found to be more sensitive to pumping and recharge rates compared to the aquifer properties. the waterbalance study confirms that river seepage and rainfall recharge are the major input to the aquifer. the model is used to forecast the landward movement of seawater intrusion because of the anticipated increase in freshwater draft scenarios in combination with the decreased recharge rate over a longer period. the results of the predictive simulations indicate that seawater intrusion may still confine up to a distance of approximately 450 940m landward for the scenarios considered and thus are sustainable.

Leblanc et al.,2012,Global and Planetary Change,a review of historic and future hydrological changes in the murray darling basin,"the murray darling basin is australia's food bowl and home to many iconic water bodies that are culturally and ecologically highly valued. the recent millennium drought (from mid 1990s to 2009) was the most severe hydrological drought since records started in the late 19th century. it severely impacted on the basin and for many acted as a wake up call. to address the ongoing declines in water resources and environmental conditions and to prepare the region for climate change, australia's governments are currently attempting to introduce a new comprehensive, and integrated approach to the management of the basin's water resources. in this paper, long term time series of climate, hydrological and environmental data are used to analyze how compounding stresses have gradually affected the hydrological system and its services. major hydroclimatic stresses considered in this paper include salinity, water use, droughts, and climate change. other, more localized or minor stresses exist (groundwater extraction, farm dams, afforestation, bush fires, cyanobacterial blooms and pollutants) and are reviewed more briefly. the history of water policy and planning shows that government actions have been strongly influential on the basin. a shift in the strategic goals from water development to the protection and restoration of environmental assets is noticeable since the mid 1990s. median climate change projections by 2030 indicate smaller reductions in rainfall and runoff than those observed during the recent millennium drought, but have a relatively high uncertainty attached to them. the use of regional approaches to reduce that uncertainty, such as statistical downscaling, points to a sizeable decline in rainfall by the end of the century. most climate projections used for planning consider greenhouse emission scenarios that have smaller global emission trends than the one observed over the last decade. other, 'less optimistic' scenarios have to be considered for long term water planning and food security. compounding all these stresses, is the naturally high hydroclimatic variability of this semi arid region, that may have been insufficiently considered during previous water development and planning efforts. successful water planning will need to balance cultural and ecological values with food production, account for high natural variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, learn from past mistakes and be cognizant of future hydrological changes.

Leduc et al.,2017,Hydrogeology Journal,anthropization of groundwater resources in the mediterranean region: processes and challenges,"a comprehensive overview is provided of processes and challenges related to mediterranean groundwater resources and associated changes in recent decades. while most studies are focused thematically and/or geographically, this paper addresses different stages of groundwater exploitation in the region and their consequences. examples emphasize the complex interactions between the physical and social dimensions of uses and evolution of groundwater. in natural conditions, mediterranean groundwater resources represent a wide range of hydrogeological contexts, recharge conditions and rates of exploitation. they have been actively exploited for millennia but their pseudo natural regimes have been considerably modified in the last 50 years, especially to satisfy agricultural demand (80% of total water consumption in north africa), as well as for tourism and coastal cities. climate variability affects groundwater dynamics but the various forms of anthropization are more important drivers of hydrological change, including changes in landuse and vegetation, hydraulic works, and intense pumpings. these changes affect both the quantity and quality of groundwater at different scales, and modify the nature of hydrogeological processes, their location, timing, and intensity. the frequent cases of drastic overexploitation illustrate the fragility of mediterranean groundwater resources and the limits of present forms of management. there is no easy way to maintain or recover sustainability, which is often threatened by short term interests. to achieve this goal, a significant improvement in hydrogeological knowledge and closer collaboration between the various disciplines of water sciences are indispensable."
Lee et al.,2018,Limnology and Oceanography-Methods,an alternative approach to conventional seepage meters: buoy type seepage meter,"we propose a new type of seepage meter to allow sequential measurements of submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) rate and sgd driven chemical flux at a point on seawater and groundwater interface. the system works on the basis of ah, the difference in head between groundwater and seawater at groundwater  seawater interface, and uses a vertical cylinder fixed to a buoy to derive groundwater outflow corresponding to ah from the seepage meter chamber to the vertical cylinder. laboratory tank tests showed that volumetric flow rate (q) from the buoy type seepage meter (bsm) compared very well with conventional seepage meter (csm). the linear relationship between q measurements with the two methods is also statistically significant (r 2 = 0.976). two sample t test reveals that there is not a significant difference between means of q measurements with the two methods. r 2 values of linear regressions between volumetric flow rate (q) and ah are 0.993 with the bsm, and 0.972 with the csm. field tests with the bsm at bangdu bay of jeju island, korea also show linear relationship (r 2 = 0.86) between sgd flux and ah, and sgd flux and sgd derived chemical fluxes are inversely related to tides. both results of laboratory and field tests support that the proposed seepage meter can be an alternative to the conventional seepage meters for measuring sgd flux, and that it can be used to monitor temporal variations of sgd flux and sgd driven chemical fluxes simultaneously."

Lee et al.,2017,Limnology and Oceanography,periodic change in coastal microbial community structure associated with submarine groundwater discharge and tidal fluctuation,"coastal areas where submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) occurs are active mixing zones with characteristic biogeochemical and ecological functions. in this study, we investigated the microbial community associated with the changes in groundwater discharge flux at a coastal beach site on jeju island, south korea. we performed water chemistry analyses, 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing, and microbial community statistical analyses on coastal water samples systematically collected as functions of tidal stage and distance from the groundwater discharge point. we also carried out groundwater level monitoring and numerical simulation of the coastal aquifer to reproduce tidally induced variations in the sgd rates of the study site. pyrosequencing and statistical analyses revealed a periodic shift in the microbial communities in the coastal waters as functions of tidal stage and sgd rates. interestingly, the community structures in the samples collected at flood and ebb tide were markedly different, despite the similarities in their water chemistry. groundwater simulation and canonical correspondence analyses suggest that groundwater discharging at higher velocities at ebb tide can detach and transport subsurface bacteria from the aquifer to the coastal water body, resulting in an increase in facultative anaerobes in the ebb tide samples. in addition, release of the sand attached bacteria as a result of particle resuspension and flushing of shallow subsurface bacteria in the intertidal zone could contribute to shaping the relative abundance of the coastal microbial community. we conclude that sgd rate is an important factor influencing the dynamics of the bacterial community structure at the coastal zone of the study site."

Lee et al.,2019,Sustainability,natural and human induced drivers of groundwater sustainability: a case study of the mangyeong river basin in korea,"the sustainability of rural areas depends on the availability of water resources. the mangyeong river basin (mrb) in korea faces a water supply shortage for agriculture and industry. based on 11 year (2005 2015) precipitation and groundwater monitoring data, groundwater sustainability was evaluated in terms of natural and man made factors and their spatio temporal variations. a precipitation time series revealed a declining trend, but there were different seasonal trends between wet and dry periods, with declining and rising trends, respectively. groundwater hydrographs from five national groundwater monitoring wells showed temporal variations. groundwater wells located in downstream areas showed both recharge from upgradient areas and local man made impacts (e.g., from pumping), resulting in an ambiguous relationship between precipitation and water levels. however, other monitoring wells in the upstream areas displayed water level responses to precipitation events, with a declining trend. using the standardized precipitation index at a time scale of 12 months (spi 12) and the standardized groundwater level anomaly, meteorological and groundwater drought conditions were compared to infer the relationship between precipitation deficit and groundwater shortage in the aquifer. the spi results indicated severely dry to extremely dry conditions during 2008 2009 and 2015. however, the standardized groundwater level anomaly showed various drought conditions for groundwater, which were dependent on the site specific hydrogeological characteristics. finally, groundwater sustainability was assessed using waterbudget modelling and water quality data. presently, if groundwater is used above 39.2% of the recharge value in the mrb, groundwater drought conditions occur throughout the basin. considering water quality issues, with nitrate being elevated above the natural background, this critical abstraction value becomes 28.4%. consequently, in the mrb, sustainable groundwater management should embrace both natural and human induced factors to regulate overexploitation and prevent contamination."
Lee et al.,2018,Sustainability,"assessment of groundwater drought in the mangyeong river basin, korea","when groundwater drought occurs, baseflow discharges to surfacewater bodies will be reduced and then domestic and agricultural water usage becomes at risk of insufficient supply. thus, in this study, several methods for groundwater drought assessment were tested with long term monitoring water level data in the study area to preserve groundwater sustainability from drought, principally caused by reduced precipitation and propagated through agricultural drought and groundwater drought. because of the monsoon climate on the korean peninsula, the groundwater storage (or water level) is secured until the end of summer, then falls by natural discharge during the dry seasons of autumn, winter and the following spring. thus, the rainfall in the wet season seems to mainly influence groundwater storage until the spring of the following year. as the groundwater level (gwl) declines due to natural drainage and the use of agricultural water increases by the end of the dry season (october may), the gwl will become lowered below the critical level. below this level, sufficient water supply is not secured. using the standardized precipitation index (spi), threshold method and 95% probability occurrence method, drought detection and the frequency of drought are compared. groundwater drought using the threshold method results in more frequent occurrence than using the spi method. the 95% occurrence method responds to severe drought but it also has weakness in missing the man induced gwl decline in every spring season. for groundwater drought assessment, an appropriate drought index should be utilized according to climatic conditions and catchment characteristics. in the study area, variations of the both natural and anthropogenic effects are mixed and the threshold method is more suitable as a measure for preventing water resources shortage."
Lee et al.,2015,Journal of the Geological Society of Korea,groundwater resources in gangwon province: tasks and perspectives responding to droughts,"korea is suffering from a severe drought in its central region, particularly in gangwon province. global climate change will cause more frequent and worse drought conditions. accordingly, the national government has proposed new water management plans that include the construction of subsurface dams and artificial recharge systems, as measures to prepare for and mitigate the depletion of water resources. we discuss whether the technology implementation meets the unique geology, hydrogeology, and geography of gangwon province. for the management plans to be sustainable in the long term, local governments must possess the authority to run permanent organizations dedicated to groundwater resources management, rather than temporary organizations formed only for drought seasons. recently, the state of california, usa which is experiencing an unprecedented drought enacted landmark legislation called the sustainable groundwater management act. this legislation gives budget and management authority related to the water resources to local governments with the role of the state being limited. while government level measures are imperative to secure water resources, the role of household practice to conserve water becomes more paramount in a sustainable society with the climate ever changing."
Lee et al.,2017,Geosciences Journal,fifty years of groundwater science in korea: a review and perspective,"we present a review of groundwater studies over the past 50 years (1968 2017) in korea. with economic and agricultural growth, water demand has been expanding, and groundwater development is gradually increasing. initially, groundwater studies were largely focused on using pumping and slug tests to understand aquifers in korea. however, the interest has expanded to groundwater monitoring and data analyses, as many national and local networks for monitoring groundwater quantity and quality have been implemented. frequent severe droughts in recent decades have led to research on the design and pilot tests for managed aquifer recharge, especially on the volcanic island of jeju and agricultural areas. as groundwater development and its use has increased, groundwater contamination is becoming a public grievance. thus, effective investigation of contaminated groundwater and its efficient remediation are big issues in the research and development (r & d) sector. the recent gyeongju earthquake posed an additional challenge for korean groundwater scientists to develop a method to predict earthquakes using groundwater monitoring. furthermore, changes in precipitation patterns caused by the changing climate aggravate groundwater recharge conditions. the country has seen many academic and technical achievements in groundwater science, but many issues remain to be resolved in the near future."
Lee et al.,2018,Episodes,current status and management for the sustainable groundwater resources in korea,"this study discusses various issues and possible solutions related to groundwater resource and water quality in korea. groundwater is an important water resource in korea, accounting for approximately 13% of the total annual domestic, agricultural, and industrial water supplies. from 1996 to 2014, groundwater usage increased by 45% while the number of wells increased by 102%. however, repeated occurrences of foot and mouth disease and avian influenza led to nationwide mass burials of livestock and major effect of groundwater contamination. in coastal areas, anthropogenic activities were considered as the cause of seawater intrusion near the shore and far (7,000 m) from the coast. thousands of abandoned metal mines and unregulated mining wastes have serious environmental effects in korea; crop cultivation in metal contaminated soil and irrigation using metal contaminated water negatively affect human health. moreover, urbanization is a major source of groundwater contamination due to intenstfied industrial activities. the korean government has made major efforts to deal with the groundwater issues, including implementation of the groundwater act in 1996. since then, various national monitoring systems have been established to examine changes in groundwater quality and quantity. additional recent important groundwater quality issues need attention and must be resolved to ensure groundwater safety in korea."
Lee et al.,2015,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science,dependence of coastal water ph increases on submarine groundwater discharge off a volcanic island,"during the past few decades, excessive input of nutrients and organic matter, in addition to global ocean acidification, has resulted in significant changes in the water ph of coastal ocean. in this study, we investigated the effect of submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) on ph variations in the coastal waters of hwasun bay off the volcanic island of jeju, korea, which is situated in the oligotrophic open ocean. in this region, salinities of all coastal waters depend primarily on sgd because of the lack of any contributions from the river or stream waters. we observed a significant increase in ph along the lower salinity plume zone, extending 0.5 km horizontally from the bottom to the surface (< 15 m water depth). the observed data for the entire bay water column showed a significant negative correlation (r(2) = 0.82) between salinity and ph. a simple two endmember (submarine groundwater and offshore seawater) mixing model showed that this ph increase was caused by an enhanced biological production, which resulted from the sgd driven nutrient inputs, rather than from groundwater dilution itself. since a number of local and regional studies showed that sgd driven fluxes of nutrients are comparable to or higher than their riverine fluxes, our results from an sgd dominated environment suggest that sgd may have a significant influence on the coastal biogeochemical changes such as acidification, deoxygenation, and eutrophication.

Lee et al.,2015,Limnology and Oceanography,dependence of ph in coastal waters on the adsorption of protons onto sediment minerals,"we measured ph, total alkalinity (talk), dissolved inorganic carbon (dic), and c 13 dic in groundwater of a subterranean estuary in hwasun bay in the volcanic island of jeju, korea. in the sandy aquifer, the ph values (7.4 +/  0.2) of fresh groundwater increased sharply to approximate to 10 and then behaved conservatively in the mixing zone between alkalified fresh groundwater and seawater. the distributions of c 13 dic, ca2+, and mg2+ in coastal groundwater, along with the results from lab experiments on sediment columns, suggest that the increase of ph in this subterranean estuary is associated with the adsorption of protons (protonation) onto sandy sediments, rather than other geochemical processes. our lab experiments showed that the protonation (1) occurs commonly for various sediments of jeju island, (2) increases ph effectively for low salinity (salinity<10) groundwater, and (3) depends on the relative amount of transition metal (i.e., fe, ti, and mn) oxides. the chamber experiments at the interface of seawater and groundwater indicate the direct seepage of high ph water into the ocean. this increase in ph leads to corresponding uptake of co2 from the atmosphere. thus, our result suggests that the reaction between groundwater and coastal sediments should be considered as an important driver of ph change that regulates the magnitude of chemical species in coastal groundwater seeping into the ocean at the volcanic island, jeju, korea."
Lee et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,exploring the long term balance between net precipitation and net groundwater exchange in florida seepage lakes,"the long term balance between net precipitation and net groundwater exchange that maintains thousands of seepage lakes in florida's karst terrain is explored at a representative lake basin and then regionally for the state's peninsular lake district. the 15 year waterbudget of lake starr includes el nino southern oscillation (enso) related extremes in rainfall, and provides the longest record of bowen ratio energy budget (breb) lake evaporation and lake groundwater exchanges in the southeastern united states. negative net precipitation averaging  25 cm/yr at lake starr overturns the previously held conclusion that lakes in this region receive surplus net precipitation. net groundwater exchange with the lake was positive on average but too small to balance the net precipitation deficit. groundwater pumping effects and surfacewater withdrawals from the lake widened the imbalance. satellite based regional estimates of potential evapotranspiration at five large lakes in peninsular florida compared well with basin scale evaporation measurements from seven open water sites that used breb methods. the regional average lake evaporation estimated for lake starr during 1996 2011 was within 5% of its measured average, and regional net precipitation agreed within 10%. regional net precipitation to lakes was negative throughout central peninsular florida and the net precipitation deficit increased by about 20 cm from north to south. results indicate that seepage lakes farther south on the peninsula receive greater net groundwater inflow than northern lakes and imply that northern lakes are in comparatively leakier hydrogeologic settings. findings reveal the peninsular lake district to be more vulnerable than was previously realized to drier climate, surfacewater withdrawals from lakes, and groundwater pumping effects. published by elsevier b.v."

Lekula et al.,2018,Physics and Chemistry of the Earth,hydrogeological conceptual model of large and complex sedimentary aquifer systems   central kalahari basin,"successful groundwater resources evaluation and management is nowadays typically undertaken using distributed numerical groundwater flow models. such models largely rely on hydrogeological conceptual models. the conceptual models summarize hydrogeological knowledge of an area to be modelled and thereby providing a framework for numerical model design. in this study, an efficient data integration method for developing hydrogeological conceptual model of the large and hydrogeologically complex, central kalahari basin (ckb) aquifer system, was undertaken. in that process, suitability of 3 d geological modelling with rockworks code in iterative combination with standard gis (arcgis) was tested. as a result, six hydrostratigraphic units were identified, their heads and related flow system interdependencies evaluated and hydraulic properties attached. a characteristic feature of the ckb is a thick unsaturated kalahari sand unit (ksu), that restricts the erratic recharge input to < 1 mm yr( 1) in the centre to about 5 10 mm yr( 1) in the eastern fringe. the analysis of the spatial distribution of topological surfaces of the hydrostratigraphic units and hydraulic heads of the aquifers, allowed to identify three flow systems of the three aquifers, lebung, ecca and ghanzi, all three having similar radially concentric regional groundwater flow patterns directed towards discharge area of makgadikgadi pans. that pattern similarity is likely due to various hydraulic interconnections, direct or through aquitard leakages, and also due to the presence of the overlying unconfined, surficial ksu, hydraulically connected with all the three aquifers, redistributing recharge into them. the proposed 3 d geological modelling with rockworks, turned to be vital and efficient in developing hydrogeological conceptual model of a large and complex multilayered aquifer systems. its strength is in simplicity of operation, in conjunctive, iterative use with other software such as standard gis and in flexibility to interface with numerical groundwater model. as a result of conceptual modelling, fully 3 d, 6 layer numerical model, with shallow, variably saturated, unconfined layer is finally recommended as a transition from conceptual into numerical model of the ckb."
Leray et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,temporal evolution of age data under transient pumping conditions,"while most age data derived from tracers have been analyzed in steady state flow conditions, we determine their temporal evolution when starting a pumping. our study is based on a model made up of a shallowly dipping aquifer overlain by a less permeable aquitard characteristic of the crystalline aquifer of ploemeur (brittany, france). under a pseudo transient flow assumption (instantaneous shift between two steady state flow fields), we solve the transport equation with a backward particle tracking method and determine the temporal evolution of the concentrations at the pumping well of cfc 11, cfc 12, cfc 113 and sf6. apparent ages evolve because of the modifications of the flow pattern and because of the non linear evolution of the tracer atmospheric concentrations. to identify the respective role of these two causes, we propose two successive analyses. we first convolute residence time distributions initially arising at different times at the same sampling time. we secondly convolute one residence time distribution at various sampling times. we show that flow pattern modifications control the apparent ages evolution in the first pumping year when the residence time distribution is modified from a piston like distribution to a much broader distribution. in the first pumping year, the apparent age evolution contains transient information that can be used to better constrain hydrogeological systems and slightly compensate for the small number of tracers. later, the residence time distribution hardly evolves and apparent ages only evolve because of the tracer atmospheric concentrations. in this phase, apparent age time series do not reflect any evolution in the flow pattern.

Levison et al.,2014,Hydrological Processes,dynamics of a headwater system and peatland under current conditions and with climate change,"interactions between headwater aquifers and peatlands have received limited scientific attention. hydrological stresses, including those related to climate change, may adversely impact these interactions. in this study, the dynamics of a southern quebec headwater system where a peatland is present is simulated under current conditions and with climate change. the model is calibrated in steady state on field measured data and provides satisfactory results for transient state conditions. under current conditions, simulations confirm that the peatland is fed by the fractured bedrock aquifer year round and provides continuous baseflow to its outlets. climate change is simulated through its impact on groundwater recharge. predicted precipitation and temperature data from a suite of regional climate model scenarios provide a net precipitation variation range from +10% to  30% for the 2041 2070 horizon. calibrated recharge is modified within this range to perform a sensitivityanalysis of the headwater model to recharge variations (+10%,  15% and  30%). total contribution from the aquifer to rivers and streams varies from +14% to  44% of the baseline for +10% to  30% recharge changes from spring 2010 data, for example. with higher recharge, the peatland receives more groundwater, which could significantly change its vegetation pattern and eventually ecosystem functions. for a  30% recharge, the peatland becomes perched above the aquifer during the summer, fall and winter. recharge reductions also induce sharp declines in groundwater levels and drying streams. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Levy et al.,2012,Hydrogeology Journal,review: groundwater management and groundwater/surfacewater interaction in the context of south african water policy,"groundwater/surfacewater interaction is receiving increasing focus in africa due to its importance to ecologic systems and sustainability. in south africa's 1998 national water act (nwa), water use licenses, including groundwater, are granted only after defining the reserve, the amount of water needed to supply basic human needs and preserve some ecological integrity. accurate quantification of groundwater contributions to ecosystems for successful implementation of the nwa proves challenging; many of south africa's aquifers are in heterogeneous and anisotropic fractured rock settings. this paper reviews the current conceptualizations and investigative approaches regarding groundwater/surfacewater interactions in the context of south african policies. some selected pitfall experiences are emphasized. the most common approach in south africa is estimation of average annual fluxes at the scale of fourth order catchments (similar to 500 km(2)) with baseflow separation techniques and then subtracting the groundwater discharge rate from the recharge rate. this approach might be a good start, but it ignores spatial and temporal variability, potentially missing local impacts associated with production well placement. as south africa's nwa has already been emulated in many countries including zambia, zimbabwe and kenya, the successes and failures of the south african experience dealing with the groundwater/surfacewater interaction will be analyzed to guide future policy directions."
Lezzaik et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,a quantitative assessment of groundwater resources in the middle east and north africa region,"the middle east and north africa (mena) region is the world's most water stressed region, with its countries constituting 12 of the 15 most water stressed countries globally. because of data paucity, comprehensive regional scale assessments of groundwater resources in the mena region have been lacking. the presented study addresses this issue by using a distributed arcgis model, parametrized with gridded data sets, to estimate groundwater storage reserves in the region based on generated aquifer saturated thickness and effective porosity estimates. furthermore, monthly gravimetric datasets (grace) and land surface parameters (gldas) were used to quantify changes in groundwater storage between 2003 and 2014. total groundwater reserves in the region were estimated at 1.28 x 10(6) cubic kilometers (km(3)) with an uncertainty range between 816,000 and 1.93 x 10(6) km(3). most of the reserves are located within large sedimentary basins in north africa and the arabian peninsula, with algeria, libya, egypt, and saudi arabia accounting for approximately 75% of the region's total freshwater reserves. alternatively, small groundwater reserves were found in fractured precambrian basement exposures. as for groundwater changes between 2003 and 2014, all mena countries except for morocco exhibited declines in groundwater storage. however, given the region's large groundwater reserves, groundwater changes between 2003 and 2014 are minimal and represent no immediate short term threat to the mena region, with some exceptions. notwithstanding this, the study recommends the development of sustainable and efficient groundwater management policies to optimally utilize the region's groundwater resources, especially in the face of climate change, demographic expansion, and socio economic development."
Li et al.,2013,Water Resources Management,an integrated groundwater management mode based on control indexes of groundwater quantity and level,"groundwater is an important source of freshwater throughout the world. due to overexploitation of groundwater over many years, a number of potential adverse hydrogeological problems have raised. to reduce such adverse effects, it is necessary to carry out strict groundwater management in over exploited areas. in this study, quantity level binary control management mode has been developed in tianjin. initially, the management is the key to determine control levels of groundwater including the blue line levels (proper levels) and red line levels (warning levels), the blue line levels can be determined by the ground settlement recovery scenario, and the red line levels can be determined through planning groundwater exploitation scenarios. by comparing the real time observed groundwater data with the blue levels and red levels the management grade of groundwater levels which are present, can thus be identified. secondly, the corresponding management strategies would be determined by the management grade. on this basis reasonable groundwater levels and mining schemes can be made. finally, the water quota for each sector can be optimized and adjusted in real time according to the binary groundwater management methodology established in this study. thus, the exploitation of groundwater can be monitored and dynamically managed by the real time monitoring levels and the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources can be achieved. to achieve all the objectives mentioned above, it is necessary to provide a powerful tool through the utilization of a numerical model for groundwater management. based on geological and hydrogeological conditions in tianjin city, a three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model was established by coupling a one dimensional soil consolidation model with modflow model. through calibration and verification, the model showed good simulation accuracy. it proved that the new management mode can provide a scientific basis for groundwater management."
Li et al.,2014,Water Resources Management,risk assessment of groundwater and its application. part ii: using a groundwater risk maps to determine control levels of the groundwater,"with the rapid development of economy, demand of water resources is becoming larger and larger, and overexploitation of groundwater is common in many areas. due to overexploitation of groundwater over many years, a number of potential adverse hydrogeological problems have raised. to reduce such adverse effects, it is necessary to carry out strict groundwater management in over exploited areas. and to achieve the strictest management of groundwater, it is critical to determine control levels of groundwater including the blue line levels (proper levels) and red line levels (warning levels). according to the establishment of evaluation model of shallow and deep groundwater exploitation and utilization risks, it can be observed that the groundwater level index factor is included in the evaluation index system in different groundwater function zones. therefore, there is a corresponding relationship between the risk grade and groundwater level of different underground aquifers. the risk grade of different groundwater function zones in tianjin is divided into five grades, which contributes to the risk management of groundwater, avoiding the arising of a wide range of risk management measure. however, to determine the key groundwater level, the standard of five grades cannot meet the requirements. the risk grades need to be divided more subtly. hence, in this paper, the risk grade was divided according to the standard of sixteen grades based on that of five grades in the first place. the higher the grade is, the greater the risk. and then the occurrence frequency of risk grade for each aquifer was counted in each administrative district or country. the corresponding water level of the risk grade, whose occurrence frequency was the highest, served as the base level. the water level of groundwater that would be exploited and utilized in the future cannot be below this base level. in consequence, this water level that served as the red line level was the minimum requirement in the planning years, while the corresponding water levels of other risk grades that were inferior to this risk grade can all be seen as red line levels. and the planning period the long term corresponding groundwater level of the aquifers under mining banned condition can be used as blue line control levels of the different planning years. finally, according to the determinate range of red line level change amplitude in each district or country, as well as the ultimate restoration aim of groundwater levels (blue line levels), corresponding measures were taken step by step to achieve the overall rising of groundwater levels. the obtained determinate control levels can provide a scientific basis for dynamic management of groundwater."
Li et al.,2014,Water Resources Research,behavioral response to contamination risk information in a spatially explicit groundwater environment: experimental evidence,"this paper assesses the effectiveness of aquifer monitoring information in achieving more sustainable use of a groundwater resource in the absence of management policy. groundwater user behavior in the face of an irreversible contamination threat is studied by applying methods of experimental economics to scenarios that combine a physics based, spatially explicit, numerical groundwater model with different representations of information about an aquifer and its risk of contamination. the results suggest that the threat of catastrophic contamination affects pumping decisions: pumping is significantly reduced in experiments where contamination is possible compared to those where pumping cost is the only factor discouraging groundwater use. the level of information about the state of the aquifer also affects extraction behavior. pumping rates differ when information that synthesizes data on aquifer conditions (a risk gauge) is provided, despite invariant underlying economic incentives, and this result does not depend on whether the risk information is location specific or from a whole aquifer perspective. interestingly, users increase pumping when the risk gauge signals good aquifer status compared to a no gauge treatment. when the gauge suggests impending contamination, however, pumping declines significantly, resulting in a lower probability of contamination. the study suggests that providing relatively simple aquifer condition guidance derived from monitoring data can lead to more sustainable use of groundwater resources."

Li et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,an intuitionistic fuzzy multi objective non linear programming model for sustainable irrigation water allocation under the combination of dry and wet conditions,"water scarcity causes conflicts among natural resources, society and economy and reinforces the need for optimal allocation of irrigation water resources in a sustainable way. uncertainties caused by natural conditions and human activities make optimal allocation more complex. an intuitionistic fuzzy multi objective non linear programming (ifmonlp) model for irrigation water allocation under the combination of dry and wet conditions is developed to help decision makers mitigate water scarcity. the model is capable of quantitatively solving multiple problems including crop yield increase, blue water saving, and water supply cost reduction to obtain a balanced water allocation scheme using a multi objective nonlinear programming technique. moreover, it can deal with uncertainty as well as hesitation based on the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. consideration of the combination of dry and wet conditions for water availability and precipitation makes it possible to gain insights into the various irrigation water allocations, and joint probabilities based on copula functions provide decision makers an average standard for irrigation. a case study on optimally allocating both surfacewater and groundwater to different growth periods of rice in different subareas in heping irrigation area, qing'an county, northeast china shows the potential and applicability of the developed model. results show that the crop yield increase target especially in tillering and elongation stages is a prevailing concern when more water is available, and trading schemes can mitigate water supply cost and save water with an increased grain output. results also reveal that the water allocation schemes are sensitive to the variation of water availability and precipitation with uncertain characteristics. the ifmonlp model is applicable for most irrigation areas with limited water supplies to determine irrigation water strategies under a fuzzy environment.

Li et al.,2014,Environmental Earth Sciences,determining the optimal pumping duration of transient pumping tests for estimating hydraulic properties of leaky aquifers using global curve fitting method: a simulation approach,"global curve fitting method (gcfm) is regarded as an effective approach in hydrogeological parameter estimation, as it integrates and uses pumping data and water recovery data of a transient pumping test for parameter estimation. the impacts of pumping duration on hydrogeological parameter estimation by gcfm were investigated in the present study using 2 in situ pumping tests and 24 simulated transient pumping tests. empirical formulas for determining the optimal pumping duration were derived. the study results suggest that pumping duration will have impacts on the accuracy of hydrogeological parameter estimation. when pumping duration is longer than a certain period, relative errors of hydrogeological parameter estimation keep relatively stable within an acceptable limit. therefore, it is unnecessary to continue the pumping for a very long time after the groundwater level has become stable. when the change rate of drawdown over time (gamma) in an observation well located within a distance of 100 m to the pumping well reaches 0.134, the pumping can be stopped. if there are more than one observation wells in a pumping test, the smallest gamma value should be selected to determine the optimal pumping duration. this research is meaningful in the instruction of pumping tests, and will reduce test costs greatly."

Li et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,"evaluation of evapotranspiration and deep percolation under mulched drip irrigation in an oasis of tarim basin, china","mulched drip irrigation for cotton field is an effective measure for the utilization of saline water, and the regulation of soil water and salt. however, the reasonable methods for quantifying actual evapotranspiration (et) and deep percolation of recharge to groundwater are still not very well understood, which restricts the accurate regulation of soil water and salt for cotton growth in oasis. in this paper, a set of experiments of mulched drip irrigation with brackish water were conducted in a typical arid region of tarim basin in southern xinjiang, china. the irrigation events were recorded, and et and fluctuations of groundwatertable were carefully measured for two consecutive irrigation periods of flowering and boiling stages. a group of upscaling conversion methods were used to quantify the et, in which canopy structure was considered to estimate the transpiration from leaf scale to a unit of field scale. the groundwatertable had a significant response to the irrigation events, thus the deep percolation was estimated using watertable fluctuation method (wtf). results showed that during the two irrigation events of flowering and boiling stages, the total et was 31.1 mm with the soil surface evaporation of only 0.4 mm. the total percolation of recharge to groundwater was 48.2 mm which contributed to the groundwater run off of 22.1 mm. transpiration of 30.7 mm accounted for 98.6% of the total et of 31.1 mm and 34.3% of the irrigation water of 90.6 mm. compared with transpiration, the deep percolation accounted for 53.2% of irrigation water, indicating a serious excessive irrigation that recharged to groundwater. soil salt budget showed that the salt leached into groundwater was 1.56 times of the input from brackish irrigation water and fertilization during the two irrigation periods. even for the irrigation practice with brackish water, the accumulated salt of soil profile could also be leached out under large amount of irrigation water (e.g. 90.6 mm for the two irrigation periods, 10 days). however, the waste of enormous water which for instance occupied 53.2% of the irrigation water in this study was not conducive to the sustainable utilization of water resources in the arid oasis. furthermore, the methods introduced in this paper for et and deep percolation calculation of cotton filed could be used to quantify the oasis hydrologic cycle of micro irrigation, to gain a better understanding of the ecological process.

Li et al.,2014,Water,identifying major factors affecting groundwater change in the north china plain with grey relational analysis,"the north china plain (ncp) is facing a water crisis under the dual impact of natural and anthropogenic factors. groundwater levels have declined continuously since 1960, causing a series of environmental problems that have restricted sustainable development in the region. in the present study, we first utilized a previously developed 3d groundwater model to determine changes in groundwater level in the region over the past 50 years (1961 2010). we then applied grey relational analysis (gra) to identify and ordinate major factors that have contributed to these changes. the results show an overall decreasing trend in groundwater levels in this region over the past 50 years and an increase in the watertable depth at a rate of approximately 0.36 m/a. groundwater exploitation showed the most significant correlation with the groundwatertable decline, when compared with other factors including precipitation and river leakage. therefore, human activities should be considered the primary force driving the groundwater level down. the results of this study have implications for developing criteria that consider changes in both climate and socio economics. furthermore, since the ncp is one of the most water scarce and densely populated regions in the world, the analytical approach used in and the insights gained from this study are of international interest."
Li et al.,2014,Journal of Earth Science,"evolution characteristics and influence factors of deep groundwater depression cone in north china plain, china a case study in cangzhou region","the north china plain (ncp) is one of the global hotspots of groundwater depletion, groundwater is almost the only source of water for agricultural, industrial and drinking water in this region. after long term's overexploitation of deep groundwater, there appeared several deep groundwater depression cones, such as cangzhou cone, dezhou cone, hengshui cone, tianjin cone, etc., in which the cangzhou cone is one of the typical cones for its special geography and hydrogeology conditions. in this study, the authors intended to analyze the evolution characteristics and influence factors of deep groundwater depression cone in cangzhou region, especially the no. iii aquifer depression cone, which is the main exploitation zone in this region. analysis of the evolution of the groundwater depression cone of the no. iii aquifer group in cangzhou region showed that this process can be divided into four stages, namely, development, stable development, rapid expansion, and gradual recovery. the shape and evolution characteristics of the depression cone at different stages are described by analyzing the evolution of the  30,  40, and  50 contours of the groundwatertable, for example the closed area of watertable contour of  50 m has been enlarged from 95 km(2) in 1985 to 6 528.5 km(2) in 2005. the dominant factors that affect the evolution characteristics at different stages are proposed. the results showed that relatively long dry periods with less precipitation, special geological and hydrogeological conditions, and sharply increased water consumption for industrial and agricultural development are the main factors that cause the formation of deep groundwater depression cones. meanwhile, an environmental response against groundwater exploitation is presented, and rational solutions are suggested to avert water crisis."

Lin et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,"groundwater sustainability and groundwater/surfacewater interaction in arid dunhuang basin, northwest china","the dunhuang basin, a typical inland basin in northwestern china, suffers a net loss of groundwater and the occasional disappearance of the crescent lake. within this region, the groundwater/surfacewater interactions are important for the sustainability of the groundwater resources. a three dimensional transient groundwater flow model was established and calibrated using modflow 2000, which was used to predict changes to these interactions once a water diversion project is completed. the simulated results indicate that introducing water from outside of the basin into the shule and danghe rivers could reverse the negative groundwaterbalance in the basin. river water/groundwater interactions control the groundwater hydrology, where river leakage to the groundwater in the basin will increase from 3,114 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2017 to 11,875 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2021, and to 17,039 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2036. in comparison, groundwater discharge to the rivers will decrease from 3277 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2017 to 1857 x 10(4) m(3)/year in 2021, and to 510 x 10(4) m(3)/year by 2036; thus, the hydrology will switch from groundwater discharge to groundwater recharge after implementing the water diversion project. the simulation indicates that the increased net river infiltration due to the water diversion project will raise the watertable and then effectively increasing the water level of the crescent lake, as the lake level is contiguous with the watertable. however, the regional phreatic evaporation will be enhanced, which may intensify soil salinization in the dunhuang basin. these results can guide the water allocation scheme for the water diversion project to alleviate groundwater depletion and mitigate geo environmental problem."

Liu et al.,2013,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,probability based nitrate contamination map of groundwater in kinmen,"groundwater supplies over 50 % of drinking water in kinmen. approximately 16.8 % of groundwater samples in kinmen exceed the drinking water quality standard (dwqs) of no3 ( ) n (10 mg/l). the residents drinking high nitrate polluted groundwater pose a potential risk to health. to formulate effective water quality management plan and assure a safe drinking water in kinmen, the detailed spatial distribution of nitrate n in groundwater is a prerequisite. the aim of this study is to develop an efficient scheme for evaluating spatial distribution of nitrate n in residential well water using logistic regression (lr) model. a probability based nitrate n contamination map in kinmen is constructed. the lr model predicted the binary occurrence probability of groundwater nitrate n concentrations exceeding dwqs by simple measurement variables as independent variables, including sampling season, soil type, watertable depth, ph, ec, do, and eh. the analyzed results reveal that three statistically significant explanatory variables, soil type, ph, and ec, are selected for the forward stepwise lr analysis. the total ratio of correct classification reaches 92.7 %. the highest probability of nitrate n contamination map presents in the central zone, indicating that groundwater in the central zone should not be used for drinking purposes. furthermore, a handy ec ph probability curve of nitrate n exceeding the threshold of dwqs was developed. this curve can be used for preliminary screening of nitrate n contamination in kinmen groundwater. this study recommended that the local agency should implement the best management practice strategies to control nonpoint nitrogen sources and carry out a systematic monitoring of groundwater quality in residential wells of the high nitrate n contamination zones."
Liu et al.,2015,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"identifying the origin and geochemical evolution of groundwater using hydrochemistry and stable isotopes in the subei lake basin, ordos energy base, northwestern china","a series of changes in groundwater systems caused by groundwater exploitation in energy base have been of great concern to hydrogeologists. the research aims to identify the origin and geochemical evolution of groundwater in the subei lake basin under the influence of human activities. water samples were collected, and major ions and stable isotopes (delta o 18, delta d) were analyzed. in terms of hydrogeological conditions and the analytical results of hydrochemical data, groundwater can be classified into three types: the quaternary groundwater, the shallow cretaceous groundwater and the deep cretaceous groundwater. piper diagram and correlation analysis were used to reveal the hydrochemical characteristics of water resources. the dominant water type of the lake water was cl na type, which was in accordance with hydrochemical characteristics of inland salt lakes; the predominant hydrochemical types for groundwater were hco3 ca, hco3 na and mixed hco3 ca na mg types. the groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by dissolution/precipitation of anhydrite, gypsum, halite and calcite. the dedolomitization and cation exchange are also important factors. rock weathering is confirmed to play a leading role in the mechanisms responsible for the chemical composition of groundwater. the stable isotopic values of oxygen and hydrogen in groundwater are close to the local meteoric water line, indicating that groundwater is of modern local meteoric origin. unlike significant differences in isotopic values between shallow groundwater and deep groundwater in the habor lake basin, shallow cretaceous groundwater and deep cretaceous groundwater have similar isotopic characteristics in the subei lake basin. due to the evaporation effect and dry climatic conditions, heavy isotopes are more enriched in lake water than in groundwater. the low slope of the regression line of delta o 18 and delta d in lake water could be ascribed to a combination of mixing and evaporation under conditions of low humidity. comparison of the regression line for delta o 18 and delta d showed that lake water in the subei lake basin contains more heavily isotopic composition than that in the habor lake basin, indicating that lake water in the discharge area has undergone stronger evaporation than lake water in the recharge area. hydrochemical and isotopic information of utmost importance has been provided to decision makers by the present study so that a sustainable groundwater management strategy can be designed for the ordos energy base."
Liu et al.,2018,Water,a multiple iterated dual control model for groundwater exploitation and water level based on the optimal allocation model of water resources,"in order to mitigate environmental and ecological impacts resulting from groundwater overexploitation, we developed a multiple iterated dual control model consisting of four modules for groundwater exploitation and water level. first, a water resources allocation model integrating calculation module of groundwater allowable withdrawal was built to predict future groundwater recharge and discharge. then, the results were input into groundwater numerical model to simulate water levels. groundwater exploitation was continuously optimized using the critical groundwater level as the feedback, and a groundwater multiple iterated technique was applied to the feedback process. the proposed model was successfully applied to a typical region in shenyang in northeast china. results showed the groundwater numerical model was verified in simulating water levels, with a mean absolute error of 0.44 m, an average relative error of 1.33%, and a root mean square error of 0.46 m. the groundwater exploitation reduced from 290.33 million m(3) to 116.76 million m(3) and the average water level recovered from 34.27 m to 34.72 m in planning year. finally, we proposed the strategies for water resources management in which the water levels should be controlled within the critical groundwater level. the developed model provides a promising approach for water resources allocation and sustainable groundwater management, especially for those regions with overexploited groundwater."
Liu et al.,2017,Cogent Engineering,"future groundwater extraction scenarios based on comsol multiphysics for the confined aquifer at linfen basin, shanxi province, china","as one of the six largest river basins in shanxi province, china, linfen basin has been in severe groundwater level declining status caused by over extraction of groundwater since 1976, along with dense distribution of land subsidence and ground fissures. future groundwater drawdown analysis due to over extraction is a major concern for not only water resource management, but also preventive and controlling measures of land subsidence and ground fissures. consequently, in this paper groundwater extraction dynamic process for the confined aquifer at linfen basin was simulated based on comsol multiphysics. then future groundwater extraction scenarios, namely, groundwater drawdown values within a period of consecutive 20 years and their consequent impacts on confined aquifer discharge amount to the yellow river were predicted. the results demonstrated that the groundwater drawdown value and lateral discharge to the yellow river would reach 7.07 m/a and 0.56 x 10(8) m(3)/a respectively in 10 years, while these two numbers drop to 3.44 m/a and 0.25 x 10(8) m(3)/a in 20 years. in order to provide valuable information for local government and policy makers, the paper would finally quantify a sustainable groundwater extraction value 20% of current groundwater extraction amount."
Liu et al.,2016,Journal of Groundwater Science and Engineering,an assessment of the carrying capacity of groundwater resources in north china plain region analysis of potential for development,"overexploitation of groundwater in north china plain (ncp) has resulted in a series of eco environment problems. sustainable use of groundwater resources in ncp, in particular management of groundwater resource carrying capacity (grcc), faces an unprecedented challenge. here we define grcc, and a new assessment method is tentatively proposed and applied to evaluate grcc based on the whole ncp, city administrative units and county administrative units. our study divided the ncp into three zones, i.e. non overexploited non overloaded zone (nnz), overexploited but non overloaded zone (onz), and overexploited overloaded zone (ooz). results confirmed 27.6% of counties belonged to nnz. however, 58.9% of counties and ncp as a whole belonged to onz, and 13.5% of counties belonged to ooz. spatially, nnzs were mainly distributed in beijing, parts of eastern coastal cities and henan province. oozs were mostly distributed in middle eastern part of cangzhou, parts of dezhou, tianjin and binzhou, and the remaining areas belonged to onzs. we suggest two approaches for enhancing grcc, i) increasing the amount of available groundwater and ii) improving the water use efficiency. an increase of 11.0 billion cubic meters to the available groundwater levels combined with water use efficiency improvements up to 479 cny per cubic meter of the world mean, the gross domestic product (gdp) sustained by groundwater in the ncp could reach 11.1 trillion cny and maintain a 20 years of gdp development assuming the current rate of growth."
Liu et al.,2018,Journal of Groundwater Science and Engineering,"analysis on exploitation status, potential and strategy of groundwater resources in the five countries of central asia","as an important part of water resources of the five countries of central asia, groundwater resources give critical supports to the regional economic development. accompanied by rapid economic development, the demand of groundwater is increasing. as a result, the governments are paying more attention to groundwater resource development and utilization. however, there are noticeable issues and contradictions in water resource exploration in these countries. to be more specific, these countries lack the studies in development potential and conception planning, thus influencing the sustainable groundwater development. this paper mainly discusses groundwater development problems in the five countries of central asia, and briefly introduces volumes and distribution of transboundary groundwater. in addition, it analyzes the current exploitation status of groundwater and studies the potential in utilizing the resource. most importantly, it proposes creative ways to address groundwater development issues: to make best of the resource, international cooperation is required."
Liu et al.,2013,Natural Hazards,"characterization and mechanism of regional land subsidence in the yellow river delta, china","in this paper, we discuss historical and recent land subsidence in the modern yellow river delta. integrated analysis of leveling and relevant background data, including groundwater level, oil extraction, and geological structure, has revealed that land displacement is driven by natural and induced components acting at various depths. since the 1950s, intense settlements occurred in the modern estuary delta lobes. between 2002 and 2008, the subsidence center of dongying and guangrao exhibited a typical subsidence area with subsidence rates of 28.2 and 64.7 mm/years, respectively. higher magnitudes are associated with groundwater withdrawals and oil gas field exploitations, which induce the compaction of a deep clayey layer. there existed a significant linear positive correlation between groundwater level and elevation in the center of the deep groundwater depression cone. the major contributor of natural subsidence is tectonic movements, while moderate sinking due to the natural consolidation of the recent delta subsoil is still acting."
Liu et al.,2013,International Journal of Digital Earth,cloud computing for integrated stochastic groundwater uncertainty analysis,"one of the major scientific challenges and societal concerns is to make informed decisions to ensure sustainable groundwater availability when facing deep uncertainties. a major computational requirement associated with this is on demand computing for risk analysis to support timely decision. this paper presents a scientific modeling service called modflowonazure' which enables large scale ensemble runs of groundwater flow models to be easily executed in parallel in the windows azure cloud. several technical issues were addressed, including the conjunctive use of desktop tools in matlab to avoid license issues in the cloud, integration of dropbox with azure for improved usability and drop and compute,' and automated file exchanges between desktop and the cloud. two scientific use cases are presented in this paper using this service with significant computational speedup. one case is from arizona, where six plausible alternative conceptual models and a streamflow stochastic model are used to evaluate the impacts of different groundwater pumping scenarios. another case is from texas, where a global sensitivityanalysis is performed on a regional groundwater availability model. results of both cases show informed uncertainty analysis results that can be used to assist the groundwater planning and sustainability study."
Liyantono et al.,2013,Paddy and Water Environment,"gis analysis of conjunctive water resource use in nganjuk district, east java, indonesia","water shortages during the dry season threaten sustainable agricultural production in nganjuk district, east java, indonesia. to mitigate this problem, farmers adopted conjunctive use of surfacewater and groundwater, but the sustainability of this practice has not been investigated. this study temporally and spatially assessed water allocation in nganjuk district when conjunctive irrigation was used. in particular, the land cover, waterbalance, and irrigation well density (iwd) were analyzed using time series gis and remote sensing data to obtain their temporal and spatial distributions. first, the land cover was analyzed to determine cropping intensity, and the waterbalance was analyzed temporally and spatially. iwd was introduced to facilitate the waterbalance analysis. second, the land cover, waterbalance, and iwd results were overlaid. third, the effectiveness of the iwd method, the magnitude of water shortages, and the sustainability of groundwater resources were considered. temporal and spatial water shortages in irrigation blocks were observed during the dry season. the change of storage showed a surplus during the wet and early dry seasons and a shortage during the late dry season. the annual waterbalances indicated that the southern part had a surplus, and the northern part experienced water shortages, especially downstream of the widas river. conjunctive use during the late dry season was predominant and concentrated in the southern part (83% of southern blocks). iwd was appropriate for examining groundwater use trends and was effective for expressing average withdrawal data (r (2) = 0.87)."
Llopis-Albert et al.,2016,Environmental Earth Sciences,decision making under uncertainty in environmental projects using mathematical simulation modeling,"in decision making processes, reliability and risk aversion play a decisive role. the aim of this study is to perform an uncertainty assessment of the effects of future scenarios of sustainable groundwater pumping strategies on the quantitative and chemical status of an aquifer. the good status of the aquifer is defined according to the terms established by the eu water framework directive (wfd). a decision support systems (dss) is presented, which makes use of a stochastic inverse model (gc method) and geostatistical approaches to calibrate equally likely realizations of hydraulic conductivity (k) fields for a particular case study. these k fields are conditional to available field data, including hard and soft information. then, different future scenarios of groundwater pumping strategies are generated, based on historical information and wfd standards, and simulated for each one of the equally likely k fields. the future scenarios lead to different environmental impacts and levels of socioeconomic development of the region and, hence, to a different degree of acceptance among stakeholders. we have identified the different stakeholders implied in the decision making process, the objectives pursued and the alternative actions that should be considered by stakeholders in a public participation project (ppp). the montecarlo simulation provides a highly effective way for uncertainty assessment and allows presenting the results in a simple and understandable way even for non experts stakeholders. the methodology has been successfully applied to a real case study and lays the foundations to performa ppp and stakeholders' involvement in a decisionmaking process as required by the wfd. the results of the methodology can help the decision making process to come up with the best policies and regulations for a groundwater system under uncertainty in groundwater parameters and management strategies and involving stakeholders with conflicting interests."

Loch et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,role of hydrology and economics in water management policy under increasing uncertainty,"well designed public policy stimulates social progress. however, when governments translate political vision into programmes for social change, the complexity of issues can overwhelm the policy making process, creating disappointment and suboptimal outcomes. in this paper we examine why evidence based policy making approaches often fail to provide policy makers with credible, consistent and clear outcomes matching broad social interest. the need for public policy primarily arises from a lack of perfect knowledge, which causes individuals and agencies to behave in ways that counter social interest. we therefore suggest that effective public policy formulation involves: determining what evidence is available, relevant and useful; as well as identifying critical gaps to making public policy necessary and meaningful. murray darling basin case examples highlight key stages in effective natural resource policy formulation, and sources of difficulties that need to be managed to maximize scientific contributions. these examples show that effective public policy decisions can still be made and information asymmetry managed via strong evidence, expert analysis to verify that evidence, and an understanding of knowledge gaps such that critical interventions can be agreed upon and objectives achieved in view of how they will be managed and resourced. finally, we draw attention to the opportunities available and challenges that exist for hydrologists, economists and other social scientists to work together in assisting the policy process, and in particular to minimize the burden of information constraints in making effective water resource policy.

Long et al.,2016,Scientific Reports,have grace satellites overestimated groundwater depletion in the northwest india aquifer?,"the northwest india aquifer (nwia) has been shown to have the highest groundwater depletion (gwd) rate globally, threatening crop production and sustainability of groundwater resources. gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace) satellites have been emerging as a powerful tool to evaluate gwd with ancillary data. accurate gwd estimation is, however, challenging because of uncertainties in grace data processing. we evaluated gwd rates over the nwia using a variety of approaches, including newly developed constrained forward modeling resulting in a gwd rate of 3.1 +/  0.1 cm/a (or 14 +/  0.4 km(3)/a) for jan 2005 dec 2010, consistent with the gwd rate (2.8 cm/a or 12.3 km(3)/a) from groundwater level monitoring data. published studies (e.g., 4 +/  1 cm/a or 18 +/  4.4 km(3)/a) may overestimate gwd over this region. this study highlights uncertainties in gwd estimates and the importance of incorporating a priori information to refine spatial patterns of grace signals that could be more useful in groundwater resource management and need to be paid more attention in future studies."

Lorenzo-Lacruz et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,groundwater level responses to precipitation variability in mediterranean insular aquifers,"groundwater is one of the largest and most important sources of fresh water on many regions under mediterranean climate conditions, which are exposed to large precipitation variability that includes frequent meteorological drought episodes, and present high evapotranspiration rates and water demand during the dry season. the dependence on groundwater increases in those areas with predominant permeable lithologies, contributing to aquifer recharge and the abundance of ephemeral streams. the increasing pressure of tourism on water resources in many mediterranean coastal areas, and uncertainty related to future precipitation and water availability, make it urgent to understand the spatio temporal response of groundwater bodies to precipitation variability, if sustainable use of the resource is to be achieved. we present an assessment of the response of aquifers to precipitation variability based on correlations between the standardized precipitation index (spi) at various time scales and the standardized groundwater index (sgi) across a mediterranean island. we detected three main responses of aquifers to accumulated precipitation anomalies: (i) at short time scales of the spi (<6 months); (ii) at medium time scales (6 24 months); and at long time scales (>24 months). the differing responses were mainly explained by differences in lithology and the percentage of highly permeable rock strata in the aquifer recharge areas. we also identified differences in the months and seasons when aquifer storages are more dependent on precipitation; these were related to climate seasonality and the degree of aquifer exploitation or undergroundwater extraction. the recharge of some aquifers, especially in mountainous areas, is related to precipitation variability within a limited spatial extent, whereas for aquifers located in the plains, precipitation variability influence much larger areas; the topography and geological structure of the island explain these differences. results indicate large spatial variability in the response of aquifers to precipitation in a very small area, highlighting the importance of having high spatial resolution hydro climatic databases available to enable full understanding of the effects of climate variability on scarce water resources.

Lu et al.,2018,Journal of Cleaner Production,ecological restoration by afforestation may increase groundwater depth and create potentially large ecological and water opportunity costs in arid and semiarid china,"water scarcity is a global environmental problem that jeopardizes human safety and socioeconomic development. since 1952, china has implemented a large scale tree planting program in the country's arid regions to combat desertification. however, there is a serious risk this program will exacerbate water shortages and lower the groundwatertable: the trees selected for this program were not chosen based on local environmental constraints, and their evapotranspiration exceeds the regional precipitation. however, no data on the afforestation's effects on the groundwatertable is available. this is problematic because any loss of groundwater will severely constrain socioeconomic development in china's arid and semiarid regions, which already face severe water shortages. the economic concept of a groundwater opportunity cost could be used to guide socioeconomic activities to improve the sustainability of groundwater use and mitigate the potential problems caused by the chinese afforestation program. in this paper, seven evapotranspiration models were used to provide the first estimate of the opportunity cost created by afforestation's adverse effects on the groundwater resource. the results showed that the groundwatertable declined yearly throughout the study area, with mean water opportunity costs in 2011 ranging from 0.04 x 10(9) rmb to 11.1 x 10(9) rmb under nine provinces in arid and semiarid china. this study provides the first solid evidence that afforestation in arid and semiarid northern china will exacerbate the groundwater decline while creating enormous opportunity costs. thus, the afforestation program must be urgently reassessed and the water use efficiency of vegetation must be considered when planning future ecological restoration both to make the restoration more cost effective and to protect the ecosphere.

Luo et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,"temporal rn 222 distributions to reveal groundwater discharge into desert lakes: implication of waterbalance in the badain jaran desert, china","how lake systems are maintained and water is balanced in the lake areas in the badain jaran desert (bjd), northeast of china have been debated for about a decade. in this study, continuous rn 222 measurement is used to quantify groundwater discharge into two representative fresh and brine water lakes in the desert using a steady state mass balance model. two empirical equations are used to calculate atmospheric evasion loss crossing the water air interface of the lakes. groundwater discharge rates yielded from the radon mass balance model based on the two empirical equations are well correlated and of almost the same values, confirming the validity of the model. the fresh water and brine lakes have a daily averaged groundwater discharge rate of 7.6 +/  1.7 mm d( 1) and 6.4 +/  1.8 mm d( 1), respectively. the temporal fluctuations of groundwater discharge show similar patterns to those of the lake water level, suggesting that the lakes are recharged from nearby groundwater. assuming that all the lakes have the same discharge rate as the two studied lakes, total groundwater discharge into all the lakes in the desert is estimated to be 1.59 x 10(5) m(3) d( 1). a conceptual model of waterbalance within a desert lake catchment is proposed to characterize water behaviors within the catchment. this study sheds lights on the waterbalance in the bjd and is of significance in sustainable regional water resource utilization in such an ecologically fragile area.

Lutz et al.,2011,Sustainability,"effects of population growth and climate variability on sustainable groundwater in mali, west africa","groundwater is increasingly relied on as a source of potable water in developing countries, but factors such as population growth, development, and climate variability, pose potential challenges for ongoing sustainable supply. the effect of these factors on the groundwater system was considered in four scenarios using a numerical model to represent the bani area of mali, west africa. by 2040, population growth, climate variability, and development as urbanization, agriculture, and industry creates scenarios in which groundwater extraction is an increasingly larger percentage of the groundwater system. consumption from agriculture and industry increases extraction rates from less than 1 to 3.8% of mean annual precipitation, which will likely affect the groundwater system. for instance, concentrated pumping in local areas may result in water level declines. the results of this study contribute to an ongoing evaluation of sustainable groundwater resources in west africa."
Lutz et al.,2011,Environmental Earth Sciences,"environmental controls on stable isotope precipitation values over mali and niger, west africa","this study evaluated the effects of the environmental factors precipitation amount (p), temperature (t), and vapor pressure (v (p)) on the stable isotope composition (delta) of precipitation and the excess deuterium (d) parameter in mali and niger, west africa. at both locations, delta values were greatly affected by seasonal climatic conditions and a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between delta and p. in mali, a statistically significant negative correlation was also observed between delta and v (p). there was no statistically significant correlation between delta and t. mean weighting of delta values may be masking both dry season and individual storm event precipitation phenomena, which are otherwise observed in arithmetically averaged delta values. mean monthly d values for peak monsoonal months indicate that precipitation is first fraction, gaining little recycled water on its journey inland from the atlantic ocean near the equator. agreement between rainy season precipitation and groundwater delta values, specifically peak monsoonal months, indicates that groundwater is being recharged by infiltration of current monsoonal rains and is not paleo groundwater recharged under past climatic conditions. similarity between rainy season precipitation and groundwater d values provide another indication that monsoonal precipitation under current climatic conditions is the source of groundwater recharge. the knowledge that groundwater is recently recharged monsoonal rains, rather than paleo groundwater, is important for evaluating groundwater sustainability and the effects that climate change will have on water resources. understanding and predicting changes in precipitation amounts and intensities, which ultimately affect timing and amount of groundwater recharge, is critical for water resource management."
Mabrouk et al.,2018,Water,"impacts of sea level rise and groundwater extraction scenarios on fresh groundwater resources in the nile delta governorates, egypt","as egypt's population increases, the demand for fresh groundwater extraction will intensify. consequently, the groundwater quality will deteriorate, including an increase in salinization. on the other hand, salinization caused by saltwater intrusion in the coastal nile delta aquifer (nda) is also threatening the groundwater resources. the aim of this article is to assess the situation in 2010 (since this is when most data is sufficiently available) regarding the available fresh groundwater resources and to evaluate future salinization in the nda using a 3d variable density groundwater flow model coupled with salt transport that was developed with seawat. this is achieved by examining six future scenarios that combine two driving forces: increased extraction and sea level rise (slr). given the prognosis of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), the scenarios are used to assess the impact of groundwater extraction versus slr on the seawater intrusion in the delta and evaluate their contributions to increased groundwater salinization. the results show that groundwater extraction has a greater impact on salinization of the nda than slr, while the two factors combined cause the largest reduction of available fresh groundwater resources. the significant findings of this research are the determination of the groundwater volumes of fresh water, brackish, light brackish and saline water in the nda as a whole and in each governorate and the identification of the governorates that are most vulnerable to salinization. it is highly recommended that the results of this analysis are considered in future mitigation and/or adaptation plans."
MacDonald et al.,2016,Nature Geoscience,groundwater quality and depletion in the indo gangetic basin mapped from in situ observations,"groundwater abstraction from the transboundary indo gangetic basin comprises 25% of global groundwater withdrawals, sustaining agricultural productivity in pakistan, india, nepal and bangladesh. recent interpretations of satellite gravity data indicate that current abstraction is unsustainable(1 3), yet these large scale interpretations lack the spatio temporal resolution required to govern groundwater effectively(4,5). here we report new evidence from high resolution in situ records of groundwater levels, abstraction and groundwater quality, which reveal that sustainable groundwater supplies are constrained more by extensive contamination than depletion. we estimate the volume of groundwater to 200 m depth to be >20 times the combined annual flow of the indus, brahmaputra and ganges, and show the watertable has been stable or rising across 70% of the aquifer between 2000 and 2012. groundwater levels are falling in the remaining 30%, amounting to a net annual depletion of 8.0 +/  3.0 km(3). within 60% of the aquifer, access to potable groundwater is restricted by excessive salinity or arsenic. recent groundwater depletion in northern india and pakistan has occurred within a longer history of groundwater accumulation from extensive canal leakage. this basin wide synthesis of in situ groundwater observations provides the spatial detail essential for policy development, and the historical context to help evaluate recent satellite gravity data."
MacEwan et al.,2017,Water Resources Research,hydroeconomic modeling of sustainable groundwater management,"in 2014, california passed legislation requiring the sustainable management of critically overdrafted groundwater basins, located primarily in the central valley agricultural region. hydroeconomic modeling of the agricultural economy, groundwater, and surfacewater systems is critically important to simulate potential transition paths to sustainable management of the basins. the requirement for sustainable groundwater use by 2040 is mandated for many overdrafted groundwater basins that are decoupled from environmental and river flow effects. we argue that, for such cases, a modeling approach that integrates a biophysical response function from a hydrologic model into an economic model of groundwater use is preferable to embedding an economic response function in a complex hydrologic model as is more commonly done. using this preferred approach, we develop a dynamic hydroeconomic model for the kings and tulare lake subbasins of california and evaluate three groundwater management institutionsopen access, perfect foresight, and managed pumping. we quantify the costs and benefits of sustainable groundwater management, including energy pumping savings, drought reserve values, and avoided capital costs. our analysis finds that, for basins that are severely depleted, losses in crop net revenue are offset by the benefits of energy savings, drought reserve value, and avoided capital costs. this finding provides an empirical counterexample to the gisser and sanchez effect."
Madani et al.,2012,Water Resources Research,cooperative institutions for sustainable common pool resource management: application to groundwater,"beneficiaries of common pool resources (cprs) may select available noncooperative and regulatory exogenous institutions for managing the resource, as well as cooperative management institutions. all these institutions may increase the long term gains, prolong the life of the resource, and help to escape the tragedy of the commons trap. cooperative game theory approaches can serve as the backbone of cooperative cpr management institutions. this paper formulates and applies several commonly used cooperative game theoretic solution concepts, namely, the core, nash harsanyi, shapley, and nucleolus. through a numerical groundwater example, we show how cpr users can share the gains obtained from cooperation in a fair and efficient manner based on these cooperative solution concepts (management institutions). although, based on their fairness rationales, various cooperative management institutions may suggest different allocations that are potentially acceptable to the users, these allocation solutions may not be stable as some users may find them unfair. this paper discusses how different methods, such as application of the plurality rule and power index, stability index, and propensity to disrupt concepts, can help identify the most stable and likely solutions for enforcing cooperation among the cpr beneficiaries. furthermore, how the noncooperative managerial characteristics of the cpr users can affect the stability and acceptability of the different cooperative cpr management institutions is discussed, providing valuable policy insights for cooperative cpr management at community levels."
Madramootoo et al.,2012,Irrigation and Drainage,sustainable groundwater use in agriculture,"with the increasing competition for fresh water, there is a growing reliance on the abstraction of groundwater for irrigated agriculture. groundwater irrigation demand has been growing steadily over the past decades, for many reasons including the unreliability of the traditional large canal schemes, and the increasing need of farmers to manage their own irrigation applications. in addition, unpredictability in climate has forced some farmers, particularly in semi arid areas, to exploit groundwater, in order to combat drought. the increasing overexploitation of important aquifers around the world, as well as groundwater contamination must be of concern to water resource planners and managers. groundwater is a finite resource, and little is being done to accurately map, assess, monitor and regulate groundwater development for agriculture. unconstrained and unregulated groundwater development is already impacting negatively on agricultural growth in over 111 million ha of irrigated lands, and innumerable livelihoods that rely on groundwater. any attenuation of growth will make it more difficult to feed 9 billion people by 2050. a more proactive and integrated approach to groundwater governance, management and protection, built upon sound technical, institutional, legal, socio economic and environmental principles is required. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Magesh et al.,2018,Journal of the Geological Society of India,"groundwater environment of a tropical east flowing river of western ghats, southern india","v of groundwater resources is increasing over the years to meet its ever increasing demand for industrial, agricultural and domestic purposes throughout the world. the scenario is even worse in the east flowing rivers of the western ghats, where the demand of water is high under changing climatic conditions. such situation may affect the groundwater resources of the river basin on a long run. the aim of the present study is to characterize the geochemistry of groundwater in tamiraparani sub basin through geochemical modeling and deduce the ionic interactions with the aid of geostatistical and multivariate statistical techniques. a total of 40 groundwater samples from shallow aquifers were collected randomly throughout the sub basin for assessing its physicochemical parameters, which include physical properties of the water, major ions and nutrients. two major hydrogeochemical facies were identified such as mixed ca mg cl and ca hco3 groups. the nutrients derived from agricultural runoff, urban discharge and organic decomposition alters the nutrient level in the groundwater. the dissolution/precipitation of minerals such as calcite and dolomite controls the chemical constituents of the groundwater. the multivariate statistical analysis indicates that natural weathering of source rocks is the main contributors of ions in the groundwater followed by anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices and urbanization. the insights obtained from this study can be helpful for sustainable groundwater management and long term monitoring studies."
Mahesha et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrologic Engineering,saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers subjected to freshwater pumping,"investigations are carried out to analyze the effect of freshwater pumping on saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers in the presence of a semipervious subsurface barrier along the coast. a conceptual, unconfined aquifer with a subsurface barrier subjected to simultaneous freshwater pumping at single/multiple locations perpendicular to the coast is considered for the analysis. the location, width, and the conductivity of the subsurface barrier being held constant, the effect of freshwater pumping at seaward and landward locations from the barrier is investigated on the interface motion. the performance of the barrier is compared with a nonbarrier condition. the numerical model developed predicts the behavior of the saltwater freshwater interface and the piezometric surface due to simultaneous pumping at single/multiple wells across the sea cost. the barrier is effective in checking the progress of saltwater for freshwater pumping on the landward side of the barrier compared to no barrier condition. the freshwater pumping on the seaward side of the barrier should be limited to smaller rates. additionally, safer zones for simultaneous freshwater withdrawal are identified for single, two, three, and four wells without the advancement of saltwater intrusion. the results obtained are of general nature and would be useful in determining the ideal location and rate of freshwater withdrawal minimizing the saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers."
Maheshwari et al.,2014,Water,"the role of transdisciplinary approach and community participation in village scale groundwater management: insights from gujarat and rajasthan, india","sustainable use of groundwater is becoming critical in india and requires effective participation from local communities along with technical, social, economic, policy and political inputs. access to groundwater for farming communities is also an emotional and complex issue as their livelihood and survival depends on it. in this article, we report on transdisciplinary approaches to understanding the issues, challenges and options for improving sustainability of groundwater use in states of gujarat and rajasthan, india. in this project, called managed aquifer recharge through village level intervention (marvi), the research is focused on developing a suitable participatory approach and methodology with associated tools that will assist in improving supply and demand management of groundwater. the study was conducted in the meghraj watershed in aravalli district, gujarat, and the dharta watershed in udaipur district, rajasthan, india. the study involved the collection of hydrologic, agronomic and socio economic data and engagement of local village and school communities through their role in groundwater monitoring, field trials, photovoice activities and education campaigns. the study revealed that availability of relevant and reliable data related to the various aspects of groundwater and developing trust and support between local communities, ngos and government agencies are the key to moving towards a dialogue to decide on what to do to achieve sustainable use of groundwater. the analysis of long term watertable data indicated considerable fluctuation in groundwater levels from year to year or a net lowering of the watertable, but the levels tend to recover during wet years. this provides hope that by improving management of recharge structures and groundwater pumping, we can assist in stabilizing the local watertable. our interventions through bhujal jankaars (bjs), (a hindi word meaning ""groundwater informed"" volunteers), schools, photovoice workshops and newsletters have resulted in dialogue within the communities about the seriousness of the groundwater issue and ways to explore options for situation improvement. the bjs are now trained to understand how local recharge and discharge patterns are influenced by local rainfall patterns and pumping patterns and they are now becoming local champions of groundwater and an important link between farmers and project team. this study has further strengthened the belief that traditional research approaches to improve the groundwater situation are unlikely to be suitable for complex groundwater issues in the study areas. the experience from the study indicates that a transdisciplinary approach is likely to be more effective in enabling farmers, other village community members and ngos to work together with researchers and government agencies to understand the groundwater situation and design interventions that are holistic and have wider ownership. also, such an approach is expected to deliver longer term sustainability of groundwater at a regional level."

Marazuela et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,"3d mapping, hydrodynamics and modelling of the freshwater brine mixing zone in salt flats similar to the salar de atacama (chile)","salt flat brines are a major source of minerals and especially lithium. moreover, valuable wetlands with delicate ecologies are also commonly present at the margins of salt flats. therefore, the efficient and sustainable exploitation of the brines they contain requires detailed knowledge about the hydrogeology of the system. a critical issue is the freshwater brine mixing zone, which develops as a result of the mass balance between the recharged freshwater and the evaporating brine. the complex processes occurring in salt flats require a three dimensional (3d) approach to assess the mixing zone geometry. in this study, a 3d map of the mixing zone in a salt flat is presented, using the salar de atacama as an example. this mapping procedure is proposed as the basis of computationally efficient three dimensional numerical models, provided that the hydraulic heads of freshwater and mixed waters are corrected based on their density variations to convert them into brine heads. after this correction, the locations of lagoons and wetlands that are characteristic of the marginal zones of the salt flats coincide with the regional minimum water (brine) heads. the different morphologies of the mixing zone resulting from this 3d mapping have been interpreted using a two dimensional (2d) flow and transport numerical model of an idealized cross section of the mixing zone. the result of the model shows a slope of the mixing zone that is similar to that obtained by 3d mapping and lower than in previous models. to explain this geometry, the 2d model was used to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in the mixing zone geometry. the higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is, the lower the slope and the shallower the mixing zone become. this occurs because most of the freshwater lateral recharge flows through the upper aquifer due to its much higher transmissivity, thus reducing the freshwater head. the presence of a few meters of highly permeable materials in the upper part of these hydrogeological systems, such as alluvial fans or karstifled evaporites that are frequently associated with the salt flats, is enough to greatly modify the geometry of the saline interface."

Martinez-Santos et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,"revisiting groundwater overdraft based on the experience of the mancha occidental aquifer, spain","aquifers provide a reliable freshwater source in arid and semiarid regions, where droughts are common and irrigated crops present significant water requirements, so intensive pumping is generally needed. over extraction leads to dropping watertables, which in turn threatens the survival of groundwater dependent ecosystems and water supplies. this calls for strategies to channel hydrological, environmental, agricultural, political and social change. based on the experience of the mancha occidental aquifer, spain, this paper explores some of the complexities of managing groundwater, dealing with the long term changes that intensive groundwater use has generated in the region. the mancha experience shows how environmental conservation may drive social and economic change at the regional scale for periods spanning several decades. what makes this case study unique, however, is the combination of social and environmental conflicts, most of which stem from the prevalence of illegal water use, and their detrimental effect on ramsar wetlands. the situation exposed a paradox, namely that subsidies for farmers to cut down on water use were actually detrimental to the welfare of groundwater dependent ecosystems. the unexpected (and timely) occurrence of extreme rainfall events in recent times, after 40 years of ineffective management measures and sustained environmental degradation, enabled the aquifer and its associated wetlands to recover spectacularly to a near pristine condition. as groundwater dependent wetlands are highly sensitive ecosystems, it is concluded that it is up to society to decide how much environmental damage can be tolerated in exchange for the social and economic benefits of groundwater based development."
Martinez-Santos et al.,2014,Hydrological Processes,modelling discharge through artesian springs based on a high resolution piezometric network,"artesian springs are localized aquifer outlets that originate when pressurized groundwater is allowed to rise to the surface. computing artesian discharge directly is often subject to practical difficulties such as restricted accessibility, abundant vegetation or slow flow rates. these circumstances call for indirect approaches to quantify flow. this paper presents a method to estimate groundwater discharge through an upwelling spring by means of a three layer steady state groundwater flow model. model inputs include on site measurements of vertical sediment permeability, sediment temperatures and hydraulic gradients. about 70 spring bed piezometers were used to carry out permeability tests within the spring sediments, as well as to quantify the hydraulic head at different depths below the discharge point. sediment temperatures were measured at different depths and correlated to permeabilities in order to demonstrate the potential of temperature as a substitute for cumbersome slug tests. results show that the spatial distribution of discharge through the spring bottom is highly heterogeneous, as sediment permeability varies by several orders of magnitude within centimetres. sensitivity analyses imply that geostatistical interpolation is irrelevant to the results if field datasets come from a sufficiently high resolution of piezometric records. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd."

Martos-Rosillo et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,"hydrochemical changes due to intensive use of groundwater in the carbonate aquifers of sierra de estepa (seville, southern spain)","the carbonate aquifers of sierra de estepa, situated in southern spain, are undergoing intensive groundwater exploitation. consequently, the volume of pumping surpasses the average recharge for periods of several consecutive years. under such conditions, nearby springs have either dried up or only function during short time periods, after very rainy episodes followed by long droughts. during the brief periods when the springs are active, their water and the water extracted by pumping are calcium bicarbonates, with a spatial temporal variability of their physico chemical characteristics that is mainly conditioned by the degree of functional karstiflcation of each system. when the springs are inactive, the pumping water gradually increases in salinity and becomes hco3clcana, cihco3naca and cina. under the new conditions caused by so much pumping, the main factors determining the hydrochemical changes are the mixing of waters and the subsequent reactions of dissolution precipitation between (i) the recharge coming from rainwater, (2) the hypersaline inputs from the clay evaporite aquitards situated on the edges and at the base of the aquifer, and (3) the water stored in each aquifer. the hydrochemical information acquired allowed us to characterize and model the groundwater of these aquifers, to study the causes of its great spatial and temporal variability, and explain the influence of exploitation. this research shows that making sustainable use of water resources associated with carbonate aquifers calls for sound knowledge of the relationship between the aquifer and other bodies of groundwater or surfacewater, the hydrochemical quality of these possible inputs, and the vulnerability of the aquifer to exploitation, which in turn is conditioned by the ratio between water reserves and recharge.

McDonald et al.,2011,Ambio,"global urban growth and the geography of water availability, quality, and delivery","globally, urban growth will add 1.5 billion people to cities by 2030, making the difficult task of urban water provisions even more challenging. in this article, we develop a conceptual framework of urban water provision as composed of three axes: water availability, water quality, and water delivery. for each axis, we calculate quantitative proxy measures for all cities with more than 50,000 residents, and then briefly discuss the strategies cities are using in response if they are deficient on one of the axes. we show that 523 million people are in cities where water availability may be an issue, 890 million people are in cities where water quality may be an issue, and 1.3 billion people are in cities where water delivery may be an issue. tapping into groundwater is a widespread response, regardless of the management challenge, with many cities unsustainably using this resource. the strategies used by cities deficient on the water delivery axis are different than for cities deficient on the water quantity or water quality axis, as lack of financial resources pushes cities toward a different and potentially less effective set of strategies."
McEvoy et al.,2015,Water,"can the adoption of desalination technology lead to aquifer preservation? a case study of a sociotechnical water system in baja california sur, mexico","there is growing concern about the sustainability of groundwater supplies worldwide. in many regions, desalinationthe conversion of saline water to freshwateris viewed as a way to increase water supplies and reduce pressure on overdrawn aquifers. using data from reports, articles, interviews, a survey, and a focus group, this paper examines if, and how, the adoption of desalination technology can lead to aquifer preservation in baja california sur (bcs), mexico. the paper outlines existing institutional arrangements (i.e., laws, rules, norms, or organizations) surrounding desalination in bcs and concludes that there are currently no effective mechanisms to ensure aquifer preservation. four mechanisms that could be implemented to improve groundwater management are identified, including: 1) integrated water and landuse planning; 2)creation of an institute responsible for coordinated and consistent planning; 3) improved groundwater monitoring; and 4) implementation of water conservation measures prior to the adoption of desalination technology. this paper concludes that viewing water technologies, including desalination, as sociotechnical systemsi.e., a set of technological components that are embedded in complex social, political, and economic contextshas the potential to create a more sustainable human environment technology relationship. by assessing desalination technology as a sociotechnical system, this study highlights the need to focus on institutional development and capacity building, especially within local water utilities and urban planning agencies."
McKnight et al.,2012,Science of the Total Environment,integrated assessment of the impact of chemical stressors on surfacewater ecosystems,"the release of chemicals such as chlorinated solvents, pesticides and other xenobiotic organic compounds to streams, either from contaminated sites, accidental or direct application/release, is, a significant threat to water resources. in this paper, different methods for evaluating the impacts of chemical stressors on stream ecosystems are evaluated for a stream in denmark where the effects of major physical habitat degradation can be disregarded. the methods are: (i) the danish stream fauna index, (ii) toxic units (tu), (iii) spear indices, (iv) hazard quotient (hq) index and (v) aquatox, an ecological model. the results showed that the hydromorphology, nutrients, biological oxygen demand and contaminants (pesticides and trichloroethylene from a contaminated site) originating from groundwater do not affect the good ecological status in the stream. in contrast, the evaluation by the novel spear(pesticides) index and tu indicated that the site is far from obtaining good ecological status   a direct contradiction to the ecological index currently in use in denmark today   most likely due to stream sediment bound pesticides arising from the spring spraying season. in order to generalise the findings of this case study, the hq index and aquatox were extended for additional compounds, not only partly to identify potential compounds of concern, but also to determine thresholds where ecological impacts could be expected to occur. the results demonstrate that some commonly used methods for the assessment of ecological impact are not sufficient for capturing   and ideally separating   the effects of all anthropogenic stressors affecting ecosystems. predictive modelling techniques can be especially useful in supporting early decisions on prioritising hot spots, serving to identify knowledge gaps and thereby direct future data collection. this case study presents a strong argument for combining bioassessment and modelling techniques to multi stressor field sites, especially before cost intensive studies are conducted.

McLaughlin et al.,2015,Water Resources Research,food security and sustainable resource management,"the projected growth in global food demand until mid century will challenge our ability to continue recent increases in crop yield and will have a significant impact on natural resources. the water and land requirements of current agriculture are significantly less than global reserves but local shortages are common and have serious impacts on food security. recent increases in global trade have mitigated some of the effects of spatial and temporal variability. however, trade has a limited impact on low income populations who remain dependent on subsistence agriculture and local resources. potential adverse environmental impacts of increased agricultural production include unsustainable depletion of water and soil resources, major changes in the global nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, human health problems related to excessive nutrient and pesticide use, and loss of habitats that contribute to agricultural productivity. some typical case studies from china illustrate the connections between the need for increased food production and environmental stress. sustainable options for decreasing food demand and for increasing production include reduction of food losses on both the producer and consumer ends, elimination of unsustainable practices such as prolonged groundwater overdraft, closing of yield gaps with controlled expansions of fertilizer application, increases in crop yield and pest resistance through advances in biotechnology, and moderate expansion of rain fed and irrigated cropland. calculations based on reasonable assumptions suggest that such measures could meet the food needs of an increasing global population while protecting the environment."

Meinzen-Dick et al.,2018,World Development,"playing games to save water: collective action games for groundwater management in andhra pradesh, india","groundwater is one of the most challenging common pool resources to govern, resulting in resource depletion in many areas. we present an innovative use of collective action games to not only measure propensity for cooperation, but to improve local understanding of groundwater interrelationships and stimulate collective governance of groundwater, based on a pilot study in andhra pradesh, india. the games simulate crop choice and consequences for the aquifer. these were followed by a community debriefing, which provided an entry point for discussing the interconnectedness of groundwater use, to affect mental models about groundwater. a slightly modified game was played in the same communities, one year later. our study finds communication within the game increased the likelihood of groups reaching sustainable extraction levels in the second year of play, but not the first. individual payments to participants based on how they played in the game had no effect on crop choice. either repeated experience with the games or the revised structure of the game evoked more cooperation in the second year, outweighing other factors influencing behavior, such as education, gender, and trust index scores. after the games were played, a significantly higher proportion of communities adopted water registers and rules to govern groundwater, compared to other communities in the same ngo water commons program. because groundwater levels are affected by many factors, games alone will not end groundwater depletion. however, games can contribute to social learning about the role of crop choice and collective action, to motivate behavior change toward more sustainable groundwater extraction.

Meister et al.,2017,Quaternary International,desert agricultural systems at eba jawa (jordan): integrating archaeological and paleoenvironmental records,"located in the arid basalt desert of northeastern jordan, the settlement of jawa is by far the largest and best preserved archaeological site in the region. the early bronze age (eba) settlement phase of jawa (3500 3000 bce) is characterized by a highly sophisticated water storage system made of a series of pools, dams, and canals. in addition, recent archaeological and geoarchaeological surveys have uncovered agricultural terrace systems in the nearby vicinity. in this study, four of these runoff terrace systems were investigated by detailed mapping. additionally, thirteen sediment profiles from inside and outside the terrace systems were recorded and sampled. the examined samples were analyzed for bulk chemistry, texture, phytoliths, diatoms, and dung spherulites to supply information on the environmental and depositional conditions. the terrace systems were dated using optically stimulated luminescence (osl). ancient terrace agriculture was practiced on slopes, small plateaus, and valleys close to jawa through the use of surface canals, which collected and diverted floodwater from nearby wadis or runoff from adjacent slopes. the terraced fields were usually arranged in cascades and comprised a system of risers, canals, and spillways. the terrace fills investigated yield osl ages of around 3300 bce, indicating that the terraces were constructed in the early bronze age. the terrace fill sequences are composed of mixed unstratified fine sediments of local origin, reflecting low energy fluvial deposition regimes. the phytolith record is dominated by pooid grasses that include the most common near eastern cereals, such as wheat and barley. increased phytolith concentrations in terrace fill sediments, as compared to samples from non terrace deposits nearby, suggest increased plant growth and water availability within the terraces. whether the terrace systems were used for growing food crops only or whether they were additionally used for grazing cannot be ascertained. overall, quantitative phytolith analyses in arid environments are well suited to investigate temporal and spatial distributions of plant microfossil concentrations and their relation to human activity or paleoenvironmental conditions.

Mencio et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,groundwater dependence of coastal lagoons: the case of la pletera salt marshes (ne catalonia),"coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems of the world, playing an important role in coastal defense and wildlife conservation. these ecosystems, however, are usually affected by human activities, which may cause a loss and degradation of their ecological status, a decline of their biodiversity, an alteration of their ecological functioning, and a limitation of their ecosystem services. la pletera salt marshes (ne spain) are located in a region mainly dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. part of these wetlands and lagoons has been affected by an incomplete construction of an urban development and in this moment is the focus of a life(+) project, whose aim is to restore this protected area. several studies have analyzed the role of hydrological regime in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton in this area, however, the role of groundwater was never considered as a relevant factor in the lagoon dynamics, and its influence is still unknown. in this study, the hydrogeological dynamics in la pletera salt marshes has been analyzed, as a basis to set sustainable management guidelines for this area. in order to determine their dependence on groundwater resources, monthly hydrochemical (with major ions and nutrients) and isotopic (delta o 18(h2o) and delta d) campaigns have been conducted, from november 2014 to october 2015. in particular, groundwater from six wells, surfacewater from two nearby streams and three permanent lagoons, and sea water was considered in these surveys. taking into account the meteorological data and the water levels in the lagoons, the general lake model has been conducted to determine, not only evaporation and rainfall occurring in the lagoons, but also the total inflows and outflows. in addition, the gonfiantini isotopic model, together with equilibrium chemical speciation/mass transfer models, has been used to analyze the evaporation and the physicochemical processes affecting the lagoons. results show that during the dry season groundwater inputs may account for 15 80% of the water in la pletera lagoons. besides, water salinity depends on two main processes: 1) mixing of fresh and sea water occurring within the lagoons or in the aquifer; and 2) evaporation. according to the obtained results, the goal of preserving la pletera lagoons and their salinity conditions implies maintaining groundwater fluxes towards the ocean, and also the hydraulic connectivity of these lagoons with the aquifer.

Mencio et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,identifying key parameters to differentiate groundwater flow systems using multifactorial analysis,"multivariate techniques are useful in hydrogeological studies to reduce the complexity of large scale data sets, and provide more understandable insight into the system hydrology. in this study, principal component analysis (pca) has been used as an exploratory method to identify the key parameters that define distinct flow systems in the selva basin (ne spain). in this statistical analysis, all the information obtained in hydrogeological studies (that is, hydrochemical and isotopic data, but also potentiometric data) is used. additionally, cluster analysis, based on pca results, allows the associations between samples to be identified, and thus, corroborates the occurrence of different groundwater fluxes. pca and cluster analysis reveal that two main groundwater flow systems exist in the selva basin, each with distinct hydrochemical, isotopic, and potentiometric features. regional groundwater fluxes are associated with high f  contents, and confined aquifer layers: while local fluxes are linked to nitrate polluted unconfined aquifers with a different recharge rates. in agreement with previous hydrogeological studies, these statistical methods stand as valid screening tools to highlight the fingerprint variables that can be used as indicators to facilitate further, more arduous, analytical approaches and a feasible interpretation of the whole data set.

Mendes et al.,2016,Forest Ecology and Management,"how dependent are cork oak (quercus suber l.) woodlands on groundwater? a case study in, southwestern portugal","cork oak (quercus suber l.) woodlands in the mediterranean basin may cope with drought continuing to grow during the dry summer period. this growth pattern relies on the presence of extensive and deep root systems and on their access to groundwater. when the watertable level is not within the reach of roots or decreases below a certain level following periods of drought, tree growth and survival might be affected. so far, little is known about the sensitivity and resilience of cork oak to both the rising and lowering of the watertable over a long term period, e.g., during one cork production cycle (9 10 years). in this study, we determined whether changes in groundwater levels influence cork growth in two cork oak woodlands located at the tagus alluvium aquifer in southwestern portugal. the selected areas have contrasting groundwater levels and an integrated framework was developed combining: (a) a standardized annual cork growth index series for tree (cork) growth assessment; (b) a monthly standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (spei) for drought periods assessment and; (c) a geographical information system (gis) based model for mapping the mean watertable depth in the dry period. results showed a decrease of cork growth index (up to 40%) immediately following a severe drought, which lowered the watertable in the dry period. moreover, in the site with deeper groundwater levels the reduction of cork growth index was higher. the mean watertable depth (in dry period) of  2.5 m was found to be a trigger value for cork growth. our findings suggest that, under shallow watertable conditions groundwater mitigates the seasonal fluctuations of precipitation and trees may use groundwater to decouple cork growth from the annual precipitation regime. we conclude that, under changing mediterranean environments, with expected increase in drought events, the decrease of groundwater levels may severely affect cork (and tree) growth and ultimately tree survival. the management and conservation of cork oak woodlands should therefore rely on adequate policies for the sustainability of groundwater resources.

Mendham et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,what lies beneath: rural landholder interpretation of the risks of aquifer exploitation in australia,"risks associated with the management of groundwater in farming landscapes are at the forefront of public discourse in australia and north america. there has been very little social research examining rural landholder attitudes to groundwater use and management. this is an important gap given the critical role social acceptability plays in resource access decisions, the important role groundwater plays in sustaining livelihoods, and the vital role it plays in maintaining groundwater dependent ecosystems. this paper attempts to address that gap by exploring how rural landholders interpret risks associated with groundwater use for irrigated agriculture. we do that by using a case study from south eastern australia where farmers' livelihoods are increasingly dependent on groundwater. we draw upon spatially referenced survey data to investigate the general extent and nature of concern about risk associated with pumping groundwater. we also explore the factors influencing risk interpretation, including occupational identity and proximity to the aquifer. survey results suggest that while there is concern about pumping groundwater for irrigated agriculture in the wimmera region, there is also considerable confidence that negative outcomes can be avoided. the dimension of risk of most concern to respondents was the possibility that the benefits of pumping groundwater would not be shared equitably. those reporting lower concern about the risks of groundwater pumping were more likely to own properties located above the aquifer, to exhibit a strong business orientation including prioritising economic values compared to environmental values, and to express attitudes indicating they thought private property rights should be protected. a substantial proportion of survey respondents indicated they were 'unsure' on all the risk items in the survey. it seems the future social acceptability of groundwater exploitation in the wimmera region will depend on the extent that those 'unsure' shift to the 'agree' or 'disagree' cohorts. the survey data suggest that focusing on the economic implications of declining watertables would be an effective way of engaging these rural landholders in dialogue about the sustainability of their groundwater resource.

Meshgi et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,an empirical method for approximating stream baseflow time series using groundwatertable fluctuations,"developing reliable methods to estimate stream baseflow has been a subject of interest due to its importance in catchment response and sustainable watershed management. however, to date, in the absence of complex numerical models, baseflow is most commonly estimated using statistically derived empirical approaches that do not directly incorporate physically meaningful information. on the other hand, artificial intelligence (ai) tools such as genetic programming (gp) offer unique capabilities to reduce the complexities of hydrological systems without losing relevant physical information. this study presents a simple to use empirical equation to estimate baseflow time series using gp so that minimal data is required and physical information is preserved. a groundwater numerical model was first adopted to simulate baseflow for a small semi urban catchment (0.043 km(2)) located in singapore. gp was then used to derive an empirical equation relating baseflow time series to time series of groundwatertable fluctuations, which are relatively easily measured and are physically related to baseflow generation. the equation was then generalized for approximating baseflow in other catchments and validated for a larger vegetation dominated basin located in the us (24 km(2)). overall, this study used gp to propose a simple to use equation to predict baseflow time series based on only three parameters: minimum daily baseflow of the entire period, area of the catchment and groundwatertable fluctuations. it serves as an alternative approach for baseflow estimation in un gauged systems when only groundwatertable and soil information is available, and is thus complementary to other methods that require discharge measurements.

Milan et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,fuzzy optimization model and fuzzy inference system for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources,"sustainable water resources management in most river basins needs appropriate techniques to implement the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources with consideration of uncertainties. in this study, first a linear fuzzy optimization model was used to find the optimal surface and groundwater withdrawal. then, by using the results of this model, a fuzzy inference system (fis) was developed to determine the groundwater withdrawal, automatically. the capability of this approach is studied in the astaneh kouchesfahan plain in north of iran. to do this, the groundwater of this plain was simulated using modflow code. then, two fuzzy optimization methods were developed to minimize the water shortage. results showed that the average water shortage was equal to 215 and 138 mcm according to current water withdrawal and the best solution for the fuzzy optimization model which was 22.0% and 14.6% of the water demand, respectively. the results of the optimization model were used to predict the optimal water withdrawal of the aquifer using the fis, considering the predictor variables. these variables were applied to the developed fis model under different scenarios in order to determine the best scenario with the highest prediction performance for water withdrawal from the aquifer. the evaluation criteria were coefficient of determination, normalized root mean square error, and the mean absolute error which were equal to 0.94, 0.26 mcm and 3.8 mcm, respectively for the best scenarios. these scenarios were able to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal and can replace the numerical optimization methods."

Minnig et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,"impact of urbanization on groundwater recharge rates in dubendorf, switzerland","groundwater, as the world's most important reserve of available fresh water, is known to be affected by urbanization. managing this resource in a sustainable way is critical for water resource management. groundwater recharge rates in urban areas remain however still poorly understood and under researched and knowledge about these rates and their expected changes under increasing urbanization is therefore of primary importance. this study aims to give insight into urban groundwater recharge by performing waterbudget calculations for four different time periods for an urban study site in northern switzerland. in order to take into account uncertainty in parameter values a monte carlo (mc) approach was carried out. our study highlights a strong positive correlation between groundwater recharge rates and the extent of the urban area. in detail, at the study site urban areas expanded from 6% in 1880 to 44% in 2009, leading to an increase in the mean groundwater recharge rate. however, the increase amount in recharge remains uncertain and varies between 29% and 67% depending on the parameter combination originating from the mc approach. based on our waterbudget calculations, the transformation of natural landscapes into impervious areas leads to an increase in groundwater recharge rates due to the reduction of evapotranspiration that more than compensates for the increase in runoff. furthermore, water main leakages contribute to an increase in recharge rates. overall, we demonstrate that a better understanding of groundwater recharge changes in urban areas is required to move towards a sustainable water management. we hope that this example will encourage the hydrogeological community to pay more attention to urban groundwater recharge.

Mix et al.,2012,Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering,"semiquantitative analysis of water appropriations and allocations in the upper rio grande basin, colorado","a semiquantitative analysis was used to assess the impacts of water rights appropriations and allocations in the upper rio grande (urg) basin, in colorado. the study also explores the causes and effects of the changes on collateral elements in the urg agriculture system, namely the san luis valley (slv) in colorado. population increases, after the acquisition of the territory from 1854 to 1900, were the major cause of increased acquisitions of surfacewater rights. by 1912 surfacewaters were nearly 100% appropriated. the population continued to increase until 1930 after which it remained stable. water users began making large increases in the number of appropriations of groundwater around 1925, with the majority of increases starting around 1935. as a result, moratoriums were placed on well development in the 1970s and 80s. individual spikes in water rights acquisitions of surface and groundwater were associated with periodic droughts and high crop prices. change point time series analysis identified three major periods of acquisition of waters rights: 1881 1911 for surfacewater, 1935 1981 for the unconfined aquifer, and 1945 1967 for the confined aquifer. collateral effects on stream flows and agricultural acreage also were evident. the annual stream outflows from the slv declined by 400 hm(3) after 1924, being attributed to surfacewater extractions. an additional reduction in outflow of 60 hm(3) from 1925 to 1963 was attributed to groundwater extraction. an increase in agricultural acreage by 80,000 ha during the period 1948 1978 fostered increases in groundwater rights acquisition from 1935 1981. doi: 10.1061/(asce)ir.1943 4774.0000436.

Moeck et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,multicomponent statistical analysis to identify flow and transport processes in a highly complex environment,"a combined approach of multivariate statistical analysis, namely factor analysis (fa) and hierarchical cluster analysis (hca), interpretation of geochemical processes, stable water isotope data and organic micropollutants enabling to assess spatial patterns of water types was performed for a study area in switzerland, where drinking water production is close to different potential input pathways for contamination. to avoid drinking water contamination, artificial groundwater recharge with surfacewater into an aquifer is used to create a hydraulic barrier between potential intake pathways for contamination and drinking water extraction wells. inter aquifer mixing in the subsurface is identified, where a high amount of artificial infiltrated surfacewater is mixed with a lesser amount of water originating from the regional flow pathway in the vicinity of drinking water extraction wells. the spatial distribution of different water types can be estimated and a conceptual system understanding is developed. results of the multivariate statistical analysis are comparable with gained information from isotopic data and organic micropollutants analyses. the integrated approach using different kinds of observations can be easily transferred to a variety of hydrological settings to synthesise and evaluate large hydrochemical datasets. the combination of additional data with different information content is conceivable and enabled effective interpretation of hydrological processes. using the applied approach leads to more sound conceptual system understanding acting as the very basis to develop improved water resources management practices in a sustainable way.

Molina-Navarro et al.,2018,Science of the Total Environment,quantifying the combined effects of landuse and climate changes on stream flow and nutrient loads: a modelling approach in the odense fjord catchment (denmark),"water pollution and water scarcity are among the main environmental challenges faced by the european union, and multiple stressors compromise the integrity of water resources and ecosystems. particularly in lowland areas of northern europe, high population density, flood protection and, especially, intensive agriculture, are important drivers of water quality degradation. in addition, future climate and landuse changes may interact, with uncertain consequences for water resources. modelling approaches have become essential to address water issues and to evaluate ecosystem management. in this work, three multi stressor future storylines combining climatic and socio economic changes, defined at european level, have been downscaled for the odense fjord catchment (denmark), giving three scenarios: high tech agriculture (ht), agriculture for nature (an) and market driven agriculture (md). the impacts of these scenarios on water discharge and inorganic and organic nutrient loads to the streams have been simulated using the soil and water assessment tool (swat). the results revealed that the scenario specific climate inputs were most important when simulating hydrology, increasing river discharge in the ht and md scenarios (which followed the high emission 8.5 representative concentration pathway, rcp), while remaining stable in the an scenario (rcp 4.5). moreover, discharge was the main driver of changes in organic nutrients and inorganic phosphorus loads that consequently increased in a high emission scenario. nevertheless, both landuse (via inputs of fertilizer) and climate changes affected the nitrate transport. different levels of fertilization yielded a decrease in the nitrate load in an and an increase in md. in ht, however, nitrate losses remained stable because the fertilization decrease was counteracted by a flow increase. thus, our results suggest that n loads will ultimately depend on future landuse and management in an interaction with climate changes, and this knowledge is of utmost importance for the achievement of european environmental policy goals.

Moqbel et al.,2018,Jordan Journal of Civil Engineering,modeling groundwater flow and solute transport at azraq basin using parflow and slim fast,"azraq basin, being one of the largest basins in jordan and a viable drinking water resource, witnessed a dramatic increase in water demand over the past four decades. this led to an over abstraction from this aquifer, which in turn resulted in deterioration of its water quality. to better manage and sustain this and other aquifers, new elaborate computer codes, called parflow and slim fast, have been used to simulate groundwater flow and contaminants' transport at azraq basin. parflow is a portable and parallel processing simulator, designed for modeling multi phase fluid flow in 3d heterogeneous porous media. this code possesses a local mesh refinement capability, uses site topography and subterranean formations and offers a variety of numerical methods for various aspects of numerical simulation, while slim fast uses the random walk method to solve sub surface transport problems of multi phase, multi constituent contaminant mixture. slim fast was written specifically to exploit a quasi analytical formulation to find a rapid solution for the advection transport. these codes provided means to predict the hydraulic head in the upper and middle aquifers, simulate the movement of total dissolved solids (tdss) in the upper aquifer and estimate the age of groundwater. results from groundwater model showed that steady state drawdown at points of observation may reach 28 m, which exceeds the 15.3 m drawdown previously predicted by other formal studies. contaminant transport model results indicated that the concentration of total dissolved solids is expected to increase slowly in the basin due to the movement of high salinity water toward the pumping wells used for domestic purposes. estimated values of groundwater age varied between 3000 and more than 50,000 years based on the flowdirection."
Morales et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,solute transport characterization in karst aquifers by tracer injection tests for a sustainable water resource management,"protection of water resources is a major challenge today, given that territory occupation and landuse are continuously increasing. in the case of karst aquifers, its dynamic complexity requires the use of specific methodologies that allow establishing local and regional flow and transport patterns. this information is particularly necessary when springs and wells harnessed for water supply are concerned. in view of the present state of the art, this work shows a new approach based on the use of a licl based tracer injection test through a borehole for transport characterization from a local to a regional scale. thus a long term tracer injection test was conducted in a particularly sensitive sector of the egino karst massif (basque country, spain). the initial displacement of tracer in the vicinity of the injection was monitored in a second borehole at a radial distance of 10.24 m. this first information, assessed by a radial divergent model, allows obtaining transport characteristic parameters in this immediate vicinity during injection. at a larger (regional) scale, the tracer reaches a highly transmissive network with mean traveling velocities to the main springs being from 4.3 to 13.7 m/h. the responses obtained, particularly clear in the main spring used for water supply, and the persistence of part of the tracer in the injection zone, pose reconsidering the need for their protection. thus, although the test allows establishing the 24 h isochrone, which is the ceiling value in present european vulnerability approaches, the results obtained"" advise widening the zone to protect in order to guarantee water quality in the springs. overall, this stimulus response test allows furthering the knowledge on the dynamics of solute transport in karst aquifers and is a particularly useful tool in studies related to source vulnerability and protection in such a complex medium.

Moreno et al.,2016,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,modeling the distributed effects of forest thinning on the long term waterbalance and streamflow extremes for a semi arid basin in the southwestern us,"to achieve water resource sustainability in the water limited southwestern us, it is critical to understand the potential effects of proposed forest thinning on the hydrology of semi arid basins, where disturbances to headwater catchments can cause significant changes in the local waterbalance components and basinwise streamflows. in arizona, the four forest restoration initiative (4fri) is being developed with the goal of restoring 2.4 million acres of ponderosa pine along the mogollon rim. using the physically based, spatially distributed triangulated irregular network (tin) based real time integrated basin simulator (tribs) model, we examine the potential impacts of the 4fri on the hydrology of tonto creek, a basin in the verde tonto salt (vts) system, which provides much of the water supply for the phoenix metropolitan area. long term (20 year) simulations indicate that forest removal can trigger significant shifts in the spatiotemporal patterns of various hydrological components, causing increases in net radiation, surface temperature, wind speed, soil evaporation, groundwater recharge and runoff, at the expense of reductions in interception and shading, transpiration, vadose zone moisture and snow water equivalent, with south facing slopes being more susceptible to enhanced atmospheric losses. the net effect will likely be increases in mean and maximum streamflow, particularly during e1 nino events and the winter months, and chiefly for those scenarios in which soil hydraulic conductivity has been significantly reduced due to thinning operations. in this particular climate, forest thinning can lead to net loss of surfacewater storage by vegetation and snowpack, increasing the vulnerability of ecosystems and populations to larger and more frequent hydrologic extreme conditions on these semi arid systems."
Morgan et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,on the interpretation of coastal aquifer water level trends and waterbalances: a precautionary note,"the changes in seawater volumes caused by seawater intrusion are often neglected in coastal aquifer management studies. the conditions under which this can result in significant waterbalance errors are not well understood. interface movements also influence temporal trends in coastal aquifer water levels, but there is little guidance on this effect. in this study, we use steady state, sharp interface, analytic modelling to generate idealised relationships between seawater volume, freshwater volume and water levels. the approach assumes quasi equilibrium conditions, which are evaluated using a selection of transient, dispersive simulations. the results demonstrate that seawater volume changes can influence significantly coastal aquifer water level trends, relative to the corresponding non coastal aquifer situation, particularly within deep aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity and low net recharge. it is also shown that seawater volume changes can be a significant component of coastal aquifer waterbalances, e.g., relative to freshwater discharge to the sea, especially within deep aquifers characterised by low hydraulic conductivity and low freshwater discharge. transient simulations show that steady state conditions are a reasonable approximation for a range of transient seawater intrusion situations, including two of the three cases considered in this analysis. we conclude that changes in seawater volumes should be included routinely in coastal aquifer waterbalances. also, temporal trends in coastal aquifer water levels may not provide an adequate measure of freshwater storage trends. it follows that the assessment of coastal aquifer condition should consider groundwater levels relative to the hydraulic head imposed by the ocean, accounting for density effects.

Mukherjee et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,"prediction of gwl with the help of grace tws for unevenly spaced time series data in india : analysis of comparative performances of svr, ann and lrm","prediction of groundwater level (gwl) is extremely important for sustainable use and management of groundwater resource. the motivations for this work is to understand the relationship between gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace) derived terrestrial water change (delta tws) data and gwl, so that delta tws could be used as a proxy measurement for gwl. in our study, we have selected five observation wells from different geographic regions in india. the datasets are unevenly spaced time series data which restricts us from applying standard time series methodologies and therefore in order to model and predict gwl with the help of delta tws, we have built linear regression model (lrm), support vector regression (svr) and artificial neural network (ann). comparative performances of lrm, svr and ann have been evaluated with the help of correlation coefficient (rho) and root mean square error (rmse) between the actual and fitted (for training dataset) or predicted (for test dataset) values of gwl. it has been observed in our study that delta tws is highly significant variable to model gwl and the amount of total variations in gwl that could be explained with the help of delta tws varies from 36.48% to 74.28% (0.3648 <= r 2 <= 0.7428). we have found that for the model gwl similar to delta tws, for both training and test dataset, performances of svr and ann are better than that of lrm in terms of rho and rmse. it also has been found in our study that with the inclusion of meteorological variables along with delta tws as input parameters to model gwl, the performance of svr improves and it performs better than ann. these results imply that for modelling irregular time series gwl data, delta tws could be very useful.

Myburgh et al.,2012,Water Sa,community groundwater compatibility assessments: an approach towards sustainable groundwater development,"to address water availability problems in a semi arid country like south africa, the national water act (rsa, 1998) proposes that specialists adopt an approach that is strategic, deliberate and dictated by socio political reforms and socioeconomic development needs on a programmatic basis for long term sustainability. to achieve this goal an approach is developed to determine community groundwater compatibility as part of the initial stages of regional rural groundwater development projects in the eastern cape province, south africa. the steps followed in the community groundwater compatibility assessment include: a desktop study where available literature is collected and reviewed. from this information and history, the sociopolitical challenges that will have to be faced for the successful completion of the groundwater development project in the study area can often be established. this is valuable information to assist the hydrogeological team in planning the community groundwater compatibility assessment, taking note of pitfalls and lessons learnt from previous approaches that might not always have been successful. a socio economic characterisation includes setting up a contact database for the community authorities and technical managers within the study. the contact database includes all contact details of the ward councillors/technical managers as well as any relevant information or comments made by the ward councillor/technical manager during the conversation. all identified stakeholders must also be contacted, informing them of the project and study. the data obtained from the role players are used to develop a social character map. site surveys and sampling are based on the social character map. the study team assesses the knowledge communities carry concerning groundwater as well as their general attitude towards the use of groundwater. data processing and analyses include the statistical processing of the collected data to assess the comprehensive measure of groundwater compatibility per area, and the individual indicators of the groundwater compatibility index are given a relative score. this enables the different indicators for groundwater compatibility per area to be combined to give a single composite score for each spatial area. target areas are finally characterised in terms of their 'community groundwater compatibility index'. maps showing the social and basic hydrogeological character of target areas are valuable tools towards assisting local authorities in decision making."
Myriam et al.,2018,Water Alternatives-an Interdisciplinary Journal on Water Politics and Development,groundwaterbalance politics: aquifer overexploitation in the orontes river basin,"aquifer overexploitation is widely used to describe negative effects on groundwater resources but has no agreed scientific definition. usually viewed as a situation where average aquifer abstraction exceeds average recharge, a diagnosis of groundwater overdraft calls upon specific hydrogeological instruments, based on the groundwaterbalance approach. an analytical method for assessing changes in water flows and stocks through time and space, groundwaterbalance is also a tool for the investigation of knowledge construction and its embeddedness within power relations. we propose to discuss the politics of groundwater overexploitation diagnoses in syria and more specifically the orontes river basin prior to the 2011 uprising and subsequent conflict. groundwater overdraft at the national level became a matter of concern in official discourse in the late 1990s as diagnoses of groundwater overexploitation became commonplace in international reports. the steady increase in groundwater abstraction in relation to syria's centralised agricultural planning from the 1960s onward had undeniable consequences on the hydro social system. however, the way diagnoses of groundwater overexploitation   in particular groundwaterbalances   were constructed and used to support water policies implemented from the mid 1990s onwards question the rationalities and interests lying behind technical arguments and actions."
Nakaya et al.,2018,Hydrological Processes,hydrochemical behaviour of an underground dammed limestone aquifer in the subtropics,"in an island area with limited surfacewater resources, the conservation of fresh groundwater resources is important for the maintenance of the water supply and irrigation system to be used in agricultural activity. in a limestone aquifer used for irrigation on a subtropical island, the progress of the dissolution behaviour of the aquifer and the effects of co2 storage and chemical weathering of the aquifer must be understood to ensure sustainable groundwater use. in this study, hydrochemical behaviour of the ryukyu limestone aquifer was investigated using the residence time of slowly flowing groundwater, which is contained by a 2.3 km long underground man made dam constructed in 2005 located at the southern edge of okinawa island, japan. groundwater dating and horizontal flow velocity measurements indicate that the groundwater horizontal flow is slow in the underground dam area, whereas the saturation index (si) for calcite indicates that the majority of the limestone exists in a supersaturated condition. the range of si for gypsum was indicative of subsaturation, and the si increased with the groundwater residence time, suggesting that the dissolution of caso4 tends to proceed slowly through the common ion effect. the dissolution of caco3, however, tends to be in suspension within about a residence time of 20 years. the apparent dissolution rate of ca in the ryukyu limestone aquifer in this area was estimated to be approximately 2.70 4.06 nmol cm( 2) year( 1), a value much lower than that of the early stages of the limestone dissolution. the estimated groundwater co2 (gas) concentrations are two order high (about 0.3 7%) relative to atmospheric co2 (about 0.04%), and the groundwater ph shows a tendency to decrease from 7.4 to 6.9 over the last approximately 20 years, indicating that the hydration reaction of co2 occurs in the ryukyu limestone aquifer. these findings imply that high co2 produced in the subtropical zone is consumed slower than co2 production during limestone dissolution, with the exclusion of the early stage of the chemical weathering process, and causes groundwater acidification in the underground dammed limestone aquifer."

Nanteza et al.,2016,Water Resources Research,monitoring groundwater storage changes in complex basement aquifers: an evaluation of the grace satellites over east africa,"although the use of the gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace) satellites to monitor groundwater storage changes has become commonplace, our evaluation suggests that careful processing of the grace data is necessary to extract a representative signal especially in regions with significant surfacewater storage (i.e., lakes/reservoirs). in our study, we use cautiously processed data sets, including grace, lake altimetry, and model soil moisture, to reduce scaling factor bias and compare grace derived groundwater storage changes to in situ groundwater observations over parts of east africa. over the period 2007 2010, a strong correlation between in situ groundwater storage changes and grace groundwater estimates (spearman's rho = 0.6) is found. piecewise trend analyses for the grace groundwater estimates reveal significant negative storage changes that are attributed to groundwater use and climate variability. further analysis comparing groundwater and satellite precipitation data sets permits identification of regional groundwater characterization. for example, our results identify potentially permeable and/or shallow groundwater systems underlying tanzania and deep and/or less permeable groundwater systems underlying the upper nile basin. regional groundwater behaviors in the semiarid regions of northern kenya are attributed to hydraulic connections to recharge zones outside the subbasin boundary. our results prove the utility of applying grace in monitoring groundwater resources in hydrologically complex regions that are undersampled and where policies limit data accessibility."

Nasr et al.,2016,Desalination and Water Treatment,investigating fertilizer drawn forward osmosis process for groundwater desalination for irrigation in egypt,"groundwater desalination could be a possible solution to egypt's water scarcity problem through applying state of the art desalination technologies. this work investigated a recently developed sustainable desalination technology which is fertilizer drawn forward osmosis (fdfo). in this work, ammonium sulfate was selected as a draw solution being a commercial, inexpensive, and efficient egyptian fertilizer. three commercially available forward osmosis (fo) membranes were tested for baseline flux. the best membrane was selected for further experimentation. a real egyptian brackish groundwater sample from el tor in sinai was used as the feed solution. performance has been assessed by the water flux, reverse permeation, and the forward rejection of the feed solutes. porifera's commercial fo membrane proved to be the best membrane with respect to baseline flux. it was chosen for further experimentation. water flux and ammonium sulfate concentration can be correlated logarithmically. further increase in ammonium sulfate concentration decreases water flux gradually due to increased severity of concentration polarization effects that take place at high draw solution concentration. specific reverse solute flux (srsf) values did not exceed 0.18g/l for both <ion, a phenomenon that could be attributed to thermodynamic influence. srsf is almost constant irrespective of ammonium sulfate concentration. while increasing draw solution concentration lead to increasing na+ ion rejection, it caused a significant decline in cl  ion rejection. this phenomenon could be probably associated to an ion exchange mechanism and the membrane surface charge. in conclusion, the scheme studied showed that ammonium sulfate is an efficient draw solution for fdfo process using porifera's commercial fo membrane exhibiting high osmotic pressure, low reverse solute permeation, and remarkable rejection of feed solute."
Navarro-Martinez et al.,2017,Journal of Environmental Radioactivity,"radionuclides as natural tracers of the interaction between groundwater and surfacewater in the river andarax, spain","the identification of specific aquifers that supply water to river systems is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of the rivers' hydrochemistry, particularly in arid and semiarid environments where river flow may be discontinuous. there are multiple methods to identify the source of river water. in this study of the river andarax, in the southeast of spain, an analysis of natural tracers (physico chemical parameters, uranium, radium and radon) in surfacewater and groundwater indicates that chemical parameters and uranium clearly identify the areas where there is groundwater surfacewater interaction. the concentration of uranium found in the river defines two areas: the headwaters with u concentrations of 2 mu g l 1 and the lower reaches, with u of 6 mu g l 1. furthermore, variation in the u 234/u 238 isotopic ratio allowed us to detect the influence that groundwater from the carbonate aquifer has on surfacewater in the headwaters of the river, where the saline content is lower and the water has a calcium bicarbonate facies. the concentration of ra 226 and rn 222 are low in the surfacewaters: <1.6 x 10( 6) mu g l 1 and <5.1 x 10( 12) mu g l 1, respectively. there is a slight increase in the lower reaches where the water has a permanent flow, greater salinity and a calcium magnesium sulphate facies. all this is favoured by the influence of groundwater from the detritic aquifer on the surfacewaters. the results of this study indicate the utility in the use of physico chemical and radiological data conjointly as tracers of groundwater surfacewater interaction in semiarid areas where the lithology of aquifers is diverse (carbonate and detritic) and where evaporitic rocks are present.

Nazarieh et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,"spatial and temporal dynamics of deep percolation, lag time and recharge in an irrigated semi arid region","the time required for deep percolating water to reach the watertable can be considerable in areas with a thick vadose zone. sustainable groundwater management, therefore, has to consider the spatial and temporal dynamics of groundwater recharge. the key parameters that control the lag time have been widely examined in soil physics using small scale lysimeters and modeling studies. however, only a small number of studies have analyzed how deep percolation rates affect groundwater recharge dynamics over large spatial scales. this study examined how the parameters influencing lag time affect groundwater recharge in a semi arid catchment under irrigation (in northeastern iran) using a numerical modeling approach. flow simulations were performed by the modflow nwt code with the vadose zone flow (uzf) package. calibration of the groundwater model was based on data from 48 observation wells. flow simulations showed that lag times vary from 1 to more than 100months. a sensitivityanalysis demonstrated that during drought conditions, the lag time was highly sensitive to the rate of deep percolation. the study illustrated two critical points: (1) the importance of providing estimates of the lag time as a basis for sustainable groundwater management, and (2) lag time not only depends on factors such as soil hydraulic conductivity or vadose zone depth but also depends on the deep percolation rates and the antecedent soil moisture condition. therefore, estimates of the lag time have to be associated with specific percolation rates, in addition to depth to groundwater and soil properties."

Nelson et al.,2016,Groundwater,local groundwater withdrawal permitting laws in the south western us: california in comparative context,"the sustainable groundwater management act (sgma) aims to control, for the first time in california's history, the state's significant use and depletion of groundwater. sgma gives local agencies a high degree of discretion in relation to a new permitting power, but the discretion is a double edged sword: agencies gain maximum flexibility to tailor their regime to local conditions, yet the statute provides no direction on appropriate components of a groundwater permitting regime. we introduce sgma and the broader legislative context to its permitting power, and we explain the continuing common law context in which the legislation operates. this information is used as the foundation for a comparative legal analysis of fundamental elements of permitting regimes. we compare a selection of six other south western permitting regimes established in legislation for areas recognized as requiring intensive management through permitting: special permitting areas (spas). we find that permitting regimes in south western spas share a structure containing several almost universal elements, although the policy settings that apply to those elements vary widely. the established permitting regimes in the other south western states' spas may inform californian agencies seeking to use their new permitting power for the first time, as well as water agencies further afield, as to important components of a permitting regime, and the different policy settings that could apply to those components. californian local agencies, and its department of water resources, which is charged with providing local agencies technical advice, should have regard to these permitting possibilities. article impact statement: existing permitting regimes in the south western u.s. can inform new regimes under california's sustainable groundwater management act."

Neupane et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,projected hydrologic changes in monsoon dominated himalaya mountain basins with changing climate and deforestation,"in mountain headwaters, climate and landuse changes affect short and long term site waterbudgets with resultant impacts on landslide risk, hydropower generation, and sustainable agriculture. to project hydrologic change associated with climate and landuse changes in the himalaya mountains, we used the soil and water assessment tool (swat) calibrated for the tamor and seti river basins located at eastern and western margins of nepal. future climate change was modeled using averaged temperature and precipitation for 2080 derived from special report on emission scenarios (sres) (b1, a1b and a2) of 16 global circulation models (GCM). landuse change was modeled spatially and included expansion of (1) agricultural land, (2) grassland, and (3) human settlement area that were produced by considering existing landuse with projected changes associated with viability of elevation and slope characteristics of the basins capable of supporting different landuse type. from these simulations, higher annual stream discharge was found for all GCM derived scenarios compared to a baseline simulation with maximum increases of 13 and 8% in sres a2 and sres a1 b for the tamor and seti basins, respectively. on seasonal basis, we assessed higher precipitation during monsoon season in all scenarios that corresponded with higher stream discharge of 72 and 68% for tamor and seti basins, respectively. this effect appears to be geographically important with higher influence in the eastern tamor basin potentially due to longer and stronger monsoonal period of that region. however, we projected minimal changes in stream discharge for the landuse scenarios potentially due to higher water transmission to groundwater reservoirs associated with fractures of the himalaya mountains rather than changes in surface runoff. however, when combined the effects of climate and landuse changes, discharge was moderately increased indicating counteracting mechanisms of hydrologic yield in these mountains. better understanding of potential hydrologic response to climate and landuse changes in these basins might be crucial for national and transnational water management.

Neves et al.,2016,Hydrogeology Journal,"climatic and geologic controls on the piezometry of the queren double dagger a silves karst aquifer, algarve (portugal)","karst aquifers in semi arid regions, like queren double dagger a silves (portugal), are particularly vulnerable to climate variability. for the first time in this region, the temporal structure of a groundwater level time series (1985 2010) was explored using the continuous wavelet transform. the investigation focused on a set of four piezometers, two at each side of the s. marcos quarteira fault, to demonstrate how each of the two sectors of the aquifer respond to climate induced patterns. singular spectral analysis applied to an extended set of piezometers enabled identification of several quasi periodic modes of variability, with periods of 6.5, 4.3, 3.2 and 2.6 years, which can be explained by low frequency climate patterns. the geologic forcing accounts for similar to 15 % of the differential variability between the eastern and western sectors of the aquifer. the western sector displays spatially homogenous piezometric variations, large memory effects and low pass filtering characteristics, which are consistent with relatively large and uniform values of water storage capacity and transmissivity properties. in this sector, the 6.5 year mode of variability accounts for similar to 70 % of the total variance of the groundwater levels. the eastern sector shows larger spatial and temporal heterogeneity, is more reactive to short term variations, and is less influenced by the low frequency components related to climate patterns."
Newman et al.,2018,California Agriculture,how are western water districts managing groundwater basins?,"making the transition from open access groundwater rights to sustainable groundwater management is a formidable task for newly formed groundwater sustainability agencies in california. as agencies begin to decide how to make equitable water allocations, how to monitor groundwater use and what mix of supply  and demand side mechanisms to adopt to satisfy sustainability criteria, the groundwater management strategies in place across other basins in the western united states are worth studying. we surveyed 18 groundwater districts in california and other western states to identify the management approaches and practices they have instituted. the conclusions we draw suggest a correlative rights framework of water allocation with phase ins for heavy users; metered pumping; flexible arrangements for trading and carrying over allocations for multiple years; and incentivizing groundwater recharge, including recharge from deep percolation from crops. rigid formulas for significantly reducing groundwater use in medium  and high priority basins are likely to have significant negative effects on the regional economy."
Ngo et al.,2015,Geosciences Journal,"the sustainability risk of ho chi minh city, vietnam, due to saltwater intrusion","groundwater is important for domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses in ho chi minh city, vietnam. as the city has developed in a coastal environment, the issue of the fresh water supply must be solved for continuous development. the aim of this study was to quantitatively estimate the risk of groundwater salinization in the ho chi minh area due to saline water intrusion into the main coastal aquifer (the upper pliocene aquifer) based on field monitoring data, and to evaluate the sustainability of the city with respect to groundwater resources. from the national monitoring database, water level data were obtained for the last 10 years (2000 to 2009), and a total of 33 hydrogeochemical and isotope data sets were obtained from the aquifer. the sustainability of ho chi minh city with respect to the groundwater supply was quantitatively evaluated at an aquifer scale using groundwater sustainability indicators (gwsis) suggested by the unesco/iaea/iah working group. the results indicated that groundwater in the southern region, part of the western region, and the area along the saigon riverside was of poor quality, with very high total dissolved solids (> 1,000 mg/l) and high concentrations of cl and fe, exceeding the world health organization's drinking water guidelines. the br:cl ratios and the delta h 2 and delta o 18 values of the samples indicated that the salinization of groundwater resulted mainly from mixing with seawater over a long period. during 2004 2009, the saline boundary moved inland, with the farthest distance reaching similar to 3.2 km. the long term abstraction of groundwater, which has been much greater than its recharge capability, is probably causing the decline in water level (in 39% of the aquifer area), the degradation of groundwater quality (in 62% of the area), and the continuously expanding saline water intrusion (by 7.4% in 5 years). thus, for the sustainable development of ho chi minh city, in addition to passive measures to regulate over pumping and pollution controls, active measures should be considered to prevent further seawater intrusion and to increase groundwater recharge through artificial recharge or better management of aquifer recharge (mar)."
Nguyen-Ky et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,predicting water allocation trade prices using a hybrid artificial neural network bayesian modelling approach,"this paper proposes an integrated (hybrid) artificial neural network bayesian (ann b) modelling approach to improve the accuracy of predicting seasonal water allocation prices in australia's murry irrigation area, which is part of one of the world's largest interconnected water markets. three models (basic, intermediate and full), accommodating different levels of data availability, were considered. data were analyzed using both ann and hybrid ann b approaches. using the ann b modelling approach, which can simulate complex and non linear processes, water allocation prices were predicted with a high degree of accuracy (r basic = 0.93, r inter. = 0.96 and r full = 0.99); this was a higher level of accuracy than realized using ann. this approach can potentially be integrated with online data systems to predict water allocation prices, enable better water allocation trade decisions, and improve the productivity and profitability of irrigated agriculture.

Noble et al.,2019,Journal of Hydrology,"isotope hydrology and geophysical techniques for reviving a part of the drought prone areas of vidarbha, maharashtra, india","a multidisciplinary approach including environmental isotope (delta h 2, delta o 18 and h 3), hydrochemistry and electrical resistivity tools were used to revive a part of the drought prone areas of vidarbha region, maharashtra, india. in this study, groundwater recharge processes, monsoon characteristics, climate variables during evaporation in the region were evaluated using environmental isotope techniques. additionally, electrical resistivity surveys were also conducted to understand the aquifer geometry and weak zones (fractures, lineament) for the sustainable groundwater development. significant seasonal variation observed in stable isotopic composition, deuterium excess and tritium in precipitation helped to delineate the sources of vapour generating the rains during both the southwest and northeast monsoons. a negative correlation between stable isotopic content and amount of precipitation is observed. two sources of groundwater recharge, namely, natural recharge from precipitation and contribution from artificial recharge structures (detention tanks) were deduced. hydrochemical data also corroborates the above findings. environmental isotope data show that the groundwater is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon, and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is insignificant. tritium data indicate that the groundwater is modern and its residence time is of the order of a few years. modelling of evaporative isotopic enrichment helped in estimating the climatic variables such as temperature and humidity during evaporation. also, the recharge from the detention tanks was quantified based on isotope balance model. aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zones were delineated in a part of the study area using electrical resistivity method. an integrated approach of multidisciplinary techniques is found to be effective in assessing the recharge processes and groundwater potentiality in drought prone areas."
Nocchi et al.,2013,Journal of Hydrology,a 3d density dependent model for assessment and optimization of water management policy in a coastal carbonate aquifer exploited for water supply and fish farming,"the ansedonia promontory (southern tuscany, italy) is characterized by the presence of fish farms that pump thermal saline groundwater. the water is extracted from a carbonate aquifer with high permeability due to fracturing and karstification that is also exploited for irrigation purposes and domestic use. such exploitation has led to the degradation of groundwater quality, producing conflict among the different users. the conceptualization of the aquifer allowed the development of a 3d finite element density dependent numerical model using the feflow code. the slightly negative freshwaterbudget in the very humid hydrologic year of 2004 2005 revealed that the aquifer was overexploited, especially due to the extraction of freshwater (along with seawater) from fish farm wells and pumping from public supply wells. the model was also used to forecast the quantitative and qualitative evolution of resources over time, thus testing the effects of different management hypotheses. results demonstrate that the sustainable management of the aquifer mostly depends on withdrawals from public supply wells; the quantity extracted by fish farms only significantly affects the freshwater/saltwater interface and, locally, the salinity of groundwater. actions to counteract seawater intrusion are proposed.

Obiri-Nyarko et al.,2014,Chemosphere,an overview of permeable reactive barriers for in situ sustainable groundwater remediation,"permeable reactive barriers (prbs) are one of the innovative technologies widely accepted as an alternative to the 'pump and treat' (p&t) for sustainable in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater. the concept of the technology involves the emplacement of a permeable barrier containing reactive materials across the flow path of the contaminated groundwater to intercept and treat the contaminants as the plume flows through it under the influence of the natural hydraulic gradient. since the invention of prbs in the early 1990s, a variety of materials has been employed to remove contaminants including heavy metals, chlorinated solvents, aromatic hydrocarbons, and pesticides. contaminant removal is usually accomplished via processes such as adsorption, precipitation, denitrification and biodegradation. despite wide acknowledgment, there are still unresolved issues about long term performance of prbs, which have somewhat affected their acceptability and full scale implementation. the current paper presents an overview of the prb technology, which includes the state of art, the merits and limitations, the reactive media used so far, and the mechanisms employed to transform or immobilize contaminants. the paper also looks at the design, construction and the long term performance of prbs.

Octavianti et al.,2018,Water Alternatives-an Interdisciplinary Journal on Water Politics and Development,disaster capitalism? examining the politicisation of land subsidence crisis in pushing jakarta's seawall megaproject,"this paper offers an analysis of 'disaster capitalism', in which fear of disaster is exploited to facilitate the entry of a capitalist project, with regard to jakarta's flood policy. after a major flood hit the city in 2013, the indonesian government launched a flagship megaproject, the national capital integrated coastal development (ncicd), as the solution for the city's sinking problem. the plan involves closing jakarta bay by means of a 32 kilometre offshore sea wall and reclaiming 5100 hectares (ha) of land. following a corruption scandal in a related reclamation project (for 17 artificial islands), the ncicd plan was evaluated for six months in 2016. although many criticisms of the plan surfaced during the evaluation period, they were not able to bring about radical change, i.e. cancellation of the project. informed by the concept of 'critical juncture' (an analytical approach focusing on a short period of time in which actors' decisions have a higher probability of affecting a particular outcome), we analyse the extent to which the framing of the sinking crisis by political actors can explain such a 'near miss' critical juncture, where change is both possible and plausible but not achieved. drawing data from newspaper discourse, interviews, and policy documents, we find that the project's proponents have eloquently framed the sinking crisis in order to ensure preference for the seawall policy, including the project concerning the 17 islands that was claimed by the critics as the capitalist part of the project. it can be concluded that the 'disaster capitalism' notion helps understand this 'near miss' outcome."
Oh et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,the combined use of dynamic factor analysis and wavelet analysis to evaluate latent factors controlling complex groundwater level fluctuations in a riverside alluvial aquifer,"to identify and quantitatively evaluate complex latent factors controlling groundwater level (gwl) fluctuations in a riverside alluvial aquifer influenced by barrage construction, we developed the combined use of dynamic factor analysis (dfa) and wavelet analysis (wa). time series data of gwl, river water level and precipitation were collected for 3 years (july 2012 to june 2015) from an alluvial aquifer underneath an agricultural area of the nakdong river basin, south korea. based on the wavelet coefficients of the final approximation, the gwl data was clustered into three groups (wcg1 to wcg3). two dynamic factors (dfs) were then extracted using dfa for each group; thus, six major factors were extracted. next, the time frequency variability of the extracted dfs was examined using multiresolution cross correlation analysis (mrcca) with the following steps: 1) major driving forces and their scales in gwl fluctuations were identified by comparing maximum correlation coefficients (r(max)) between dfs and the gwl time series and 2) the results were supplemented using the wavelet transformed coherence (wtc) analysis between dfs and the hydrological time series. finally, relative contributions of six major dfs to the gwl fluctuations could be quantitatively assessed by calculating the effective dynamic efficiency (d ef). the characteristics and relevant process of the identified six dfs are: 1) wcgidf(4,1) as an indicative of seasonal agricultural pumping (scales = 64 128 days; r(max) = 0.68 0.89; d ef <= 23.1%); 2) wcg1df(4,4) representing the cycle of regional groundwater recharge (scales = 64 128 days; r(max) = 0.98 1.00; d ef <= 11.1%); 3) wcg2df(4,1) indicating the complex interaction between the episodes of precipitation and direct runoff (scales = 2 8 days; r(max) = 0.82 0.91; d ef <= 353%) and seasonal gw rw interaction (scales = 64 128 days; r(max)= 0.76 0.91; d ef <= 14.2%); 4) wcg2df(4,4) reflecting the complex effects of seasonal pervasive pumping and the local recharge cycle (scales = 64 128 days; r(max) = 0.86 0.94; d ef <= 16.4%); 5) wcg3df(4,2) as the result of temporal pumping (scales = 2 8 days; r(max)= 0.98 0.99; d ef <= 7.7%); and 6) wcg3df(4,4) indicating the local recharge cycle (scales = 64 128 days; r(max)= 0.76 0.91; d ef <= 34.2 %). this study shows that major driving forces controlling gwl time series data in a complex hydrological setting can be identified and quantitatively evaluated by the combined use of dfa and wa and applying mrcca and wtc.

Oiro et al.,2019,Journal of African Earth Sciences,"drivers, patterns and velocity of saltwater intrusion in a stressed aquifer of the east african coast: joint analysis of groundwater and geophysical data in southern kenya","fresh groundwater resources in coastal east africa are crucial for the region's socio economic development but are under threat of salinization caused by changes in recharge patterns and increasing abstraction. with the aim of establishing the drivers behind saltwater intrusion and its current spatial extent, we studied the kenyan south coast aquifer, a representative, strategic aquifer under increased pressure. investigations included electrical resistivity tomography (ert) surveys and in situ groundwater measurements (watertable and basic quality) together with the analysis of available long term climatic and borehole monitoring data. over the last 40 years, groundwater electrical conductivity values at the well field increased by about three times and groundwater levels declined by 1 3 m over the last decade. when put in perspective with the long term climate (rainfall, temperature) and abstraction records, these trends in groundwater appear to be primarily driven by increased borehole abstraction (+ 400 m(3)/day per year in average), whereas observed increasing temperature (+ 0.02 degrees c per year) and decreasing rainfall (  0.8 mm per year) could potentially act as a secondary control through reduced recharge. however the low statistical significance obtained for both rainfall and temperature trends over the observation period suggests that no clear conclusion can be made with regards to long term climate impact on groundwater. groundwater quality mapping showed that proximity to the ocean, presence of abstraction well fields and regional geology control groundwater salinity patterns at regional scale. locally, geophysical data showed that, saltwater intrusion spatial patterns are controlled by local aquifer lithology, groundwater abstraction and freshwater recharge in floodplains. comparison with previous (1984) resistivity data showed that the saltwater front has advanced toward the well field by up to 2 km and rose by up to 80 m over the last 30 years, which corresponds to a maximal velocity of about 60 m/y horizontally and 2 m/y vertically. implementation of groundwater management strategies such as sustainable groundwater exploitation, sourced alternative water supply, and managed aquifer recharge are required to mitigate the effects of seawater intrusion along the east african coastal strip."
Ojha et al.,2018,Water,water taxation and subsidy analysis based on consumer water use behavior and water sources inside the kathmandu valley,"groundwater is a major alternative water source used to cover the deficit of water supplied by kathmandu upatyaka khanepani limited (kukl), the authority responsible for water supply inside kathmandu valley. the groundwater price relative to that of kukl affects priority of usage, and hence, groundwater resources sustainability. therefore, taxation or subsidies on water sources become necessary based on their implication on environment. in this study, we evaluate volumetric water price, including initial investment, operation and maintenance (o&m) cost for different water sources, and compare it with the water price of kukl, kathmandu. the results show that shallow groundwater is cheaper than kukl's water. for groundwater sustainability, taxation on shallow groundwater seems necessary. for the recent water use of 97 lpcd (liters per capita per day) the taxation requirement is nepalese rupee (nrs.) 320/month (0.35% of total expenditure) if the initial investment for well construction and o&m cost are considered, and nrs. 626 (0.7% of total expenditure) if only o&m cost is considered. on the other hand, rainwater harvesting and recharging, the measures to cope with groundwater exploitation, might need 40% to 50% subsidy for their initial investment."

Ouedraogo et al.,2016,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,a meta analysis and statistical modelling of nitrates in groundwater at the african scale,"contamination of groundwater with nitrate poses a major health risk to millions of people around africa. assessing the space time distribution of this contamination, as well as understanding the factors that explain this contamination, is important for managing sustainable drinking water at the regional scale. this study aims to assess the variables that contribute to nitrate pollution in groundwater at the african scale by statistical modelling. we compiled a literature database of nitrate concentration in groundwater (around 250 studies) and combined it with digital maps of physical attributes such as soil, geology, climate, hydrogeology, and anthropogenic data for statistical model development. the maximum, medium, and minimum observed nitrate concentrations were analysed. in total, 13 explanatory variables were screened to explain observed nitrate pollution in groundwater. for the mean nitrate concentration, four variables are retained in the statistical explanatory model: (1) depth to groundwater (shallow groundwater, typically <50 m); (2) recharge rate; (3) aquifer type; and (4) population density. the first three variables represent intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater systems to pollution, while the latter variable is a proxy for anthropogenic pollution pressure. the model explains 65 % of the variation of mean nitrate contamination in groundwater at the african scale. using the same proxy information, we could develop a statistical model for the maximum nitrate concentrations that explains 42 % of the nitrate variation. for the maximum concentrations, other environmental attributes such as soil type, slope, rainfall, climate class, and region type improve the prediction of maximum nitrate concentrations at the african scale. as to minimal nitrate concentrations, in the absence of normal distribution assumptions of the data set, we do not develop a statistical model for these data. the data based statistical model presented here represents an important step towards developing tools that will allow us to accurately predict nitrate distribution at the african scale and thus may support groundwater monitoring and water management that aims to protect groundwater systems. yet they should be further refined and validated when more detailed and harmonized data become available and/or combined with more conceptual descriptions of the fate of nutrients in the hydrosystem."

Ouyang et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,satellite based estimation of watershed groundwater storage dynamics in a freeze thaw area under intensive agricultural development,"understanding the temporal spatial characteristics of groundwater storage is critical for agricultural planning and management in the future, thereby causing more challenges in water resource management. however, the special hydrological features of the snow water equivalent, soil moisture, and total canopy water storage in the freeze thawing agricultural area requires the innovative methods for the water resource analysis. the watershed land cover variation and the expanding pattern of the farmlands over a decade were identified using the tm landsat series data. combined with the traditional measurements of the water resource, the monthly gravity field data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace) was validated and applied. the water resources distribution based on the remotely sensed data demonstrated that the forest in the watershed center had a larger amount of water storage. the inter annual and seasonal variability of total water storage (tws) over the agricultural area was analyzed and the higher value appeared in the thawing period of april. the correlations of the tws stream flow, soil moisture and snow water equivalent with precipitation were all identified. the precipitation was the dominant factor for the watershed tws and the groundwater dynamics. under the similar precipitation condition, the lower groundwater storage in recent years was the consequence of the expanding of farmland. the watershed averaged decrease rate of groundwater level from 2003 to 2012 was 1.06 mm/year, which was much lower than the rates in other agricultural areas. the freeze thawing process with smelt snow and rainfall in summer had more time and chance to recharge the groundwater resource and provided the sustainable water resource. this study proved that the application of grace was an effective method for the temporal spatial estimation of the tws anomalies in the freeze thawing agricultural area.

Pacheco et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,modification to the drastic framework to assess groundwater contaminant risk in rural mountainous catchments,"mountainous headwater catchments are safeguards of quality groundwater and hence require special protection against contamination by anthropogenic sources. however, methods currently handling contamination risk fail to produce reliable results in mountainous watersheds because they overlook the influence of downhill flows and contaminant transport in the validation process. to overcome this difficulty, a new model based on so called ""concentration profiles"" is presented that combines the drastic framework for evaluation of intrinsic vulnerability, the categorization of landuses for evaluation of specific vulnerability to nitrate and processing modflow graphical user interface for simulation of nitrate transport. this model was tested in a mountainous region of northern portugal. the risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate was generally classified as moderate. the risky areas are regions used for agriculture and livestock production. these activities have raised nitrate concentrations of spring water (15 25 mg.l( 1)) downstream the risky areas. the modflow simulations linked the risky areas (contaminant sources) to actual nitrate plumes (contaminant sinks) and modeled nitrate distributions at specific groundwater travel times. winter plumes could be simulated for the 1 year stress period, and hence are flushable in a short time span. spring and summer plumes could only be explained by contaminant transport during 10 20 years. in these cases, even if contaminant sources were immediately neutralized, the washout of nitrate would take decades. these results may hold back the fulfillment of sustainable development goals related to water and sanitation until 2030, and hence deserve reflection by water planners and policy makers. the modeling exercise provided extra evidence that safeguarding the catchment headwater is the keystone of groundwater quality protection in mountainous catchments. therefore, application of this modified drastic to other mountainous areas may not need to resort to processing modflow. the study comprises the main paper (this paper) and a methodsx companion paper."

Panda et al.,2018,Environmental Earth Sciences,"mapping lithological variations in a river basin of west bengal, india using electrical resistivity survey: implications for artificial recharge","groundwater is a treasured earth's resource and plays an important role in addressing water and environmental sustainability. however, its overexploitation and wide spatial variability within a basin and/or across regions are posing a serious challenge for groundwater sustainability. some parts of southern west bengal of india are problematic for groundwater occurrence despite of high rainfall in this region. characterization of an aquifer in this area is very important for sustainable development of water supply and artificial recharge. electrical resistivity surveys using 1 d and 2 d arrays were performed at a regular interval from subarnarekha river at bhasraghat (south) to kharagpur (north) to map the lithological variations in this area. resistivity sounding surveys were carried out at an interval of 2 3km. subsurface resistivity variation has been interpreted using very fast simulated annealing (vfsa) global optimization technique. the analysis of the field data indicated that the resistivity variation with depth is suitable in the southern part of the area and corresponds to clayey sand. interpreted resistivity in the northern part of the area is relatively high and reveals impervious laterite layer. in the southern part of the area resistivity varies between 15 and 40m at a depth below 30m. a 2 d resistivity imaging conducted at the most important location in the area is correlated well with the 1 d results. based on the interpreted resistivity variation with depth at different locations different types of geologic units (laterite, clay, sand, etc.) are classified, and the zone of interests for aquifer has been demarcated. study reveals that southern part of the area is better for artificial recharge than the northern part. the presence of laterite cover in the northern part of the area restricts the percolation of rainwater to recharge the aquifer at depth. to recharge the aquifer at depth in the northern part of the area, rainwater must be sent artificially at depth by puncturing laterite layers on the top. such studies in challenging areas will help in understanding the problems and finding its solution."

Pandian et al.,2016,Hydrology Research,finite element modelling of a heavily exploited coastal aquifer for assessing the response of groundwater level to the changes in pumping and rainfall variation due to climate change,"coastal aquifers are always under threat of seawater intrusion due to over extraction of groundwater. the objective here is to assess aquifer response to variation in pumping and rainfall recharge due to projected climate change by groundwater modelling in a heavily exploited aquifer. finite element groundwater flow modelling was carried out from march 1988 to december 2030 using feflow software. steady state calibration was done to match observed and simulated groundwater head by varying aquifer parameters within the allowable range. transient state calibration was carried out during the period march 1988 to december 2002. the calibrated model was validated by comparing the simulated and observed groundwater head from january 2003 to december 2012. groundwater head was predicted for a period until 2030 under eight different scenarios of changes in pumping and rainfall recharge. this prediction indicated that 10% increase of recharge and 10% decrease of pumping causes 3 m and 6 m increase in groundwater head in upper and lower aquifers, respectively, by the end of 2030. groundwater recharge can be increased by rejuvenation of existing surfacewater bodies, check dams and construction of proposed check dams. thus, increase of groundwater recharge and decrease in well field pumping is achievable to restore this heavily exploited coastal aquifer in another 20 years."
Paris et al.,2019,Sustainable Water Resources Management,wellhead protection zones for sustainable groundwater supply,"wellhead protection zones (wpzs) and groundwater supply protection areas are strategies to minimize contamination hazards and ensure a safe groundwater supply. their implementation may require landuse restrictions, industrial process changes and/or waste and effluent treatment changes, service adaptations, systematic controls of groundwater levels and groundwater quality and detailed well inspections. the aim of this paper is to present a scheme to ensure the protection of drinking water sources comprising the new pumping field supplying esperanza and rafaela cities in santa fe province, argentina. a 5 10 m radius was adopted for delineating the wellhead operational zones. to define the microbiological and surveillance zones, the fixed radius and wys sling methods were applied, taking into account the groundwater travel time of 50 and 100 days, respectively. the land activities were inventoried and categorized according to their potential for generating a subsurface contaminant load. a sanitary survey and assessment of pumping wells was made using a checklist. the results have shown that appropriate radii might be 70 m for the microbiological protection zone and 100 m for the surveillance zone. these values were obtained taking into account a pumping rate of approximately 60 70 m(3)/h. this abstraction rate should be regulated and maintained because it not only affects the validity of the defined zones but also, when it is exceeded, induces an influx of water of different quality to the semi confined aquifer."

Park et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,a delineation of regional hydraulic conductivity based on watertable fluctuation,"the estimation of regional hydraulic conductivity is essential for the sustainable development and efficient management of groundwater. this paper presents a new physical method of estimating hydraulic conductivity based on the water level fluctuation model developed by park and parker (park, e., parker, j.c., 2008. a simple model for watertable fluctuations in response to precipitation. j. hydrol. 356, 344 349). the developed procedure was validated by comparison with the hypothetical numerical model for a variety of hydraulic conductivities, aquifer inclinations, and the heterogeneities. the model was found to be highly reliable when using water level data far from the hydraulic boundaries. the results show that the monitoring data obtained over a range of relative distances of an observation location (x) to the flow domain (w), x/w > 0.2 avoided the boundary effects. a correction factor was also proposed based on the deviation analysis of the calibrated k and f/n (ratio of recharge to precipitation divided by porosity). the results from the basal inclinations and the heterogeneities cases suggest that the estimated hydraulic conductivity is representing regional property rather than the local one. to confirm the validity of the proposed procedure, it was applied to the coastal aquifer of jeju island, korea. the calibrated hydraulic conductivities were consistent with the results from previous studies. these results show that the proposed method is an effective and economical means to estimate hydraulic conductivity of large supporting volumes of subsurface aquifers with the convenient use of recharge and groundwater level data.

Parkinson et al.,2018,Applied Energy,a multi criteria model analysis framework for assessing integrated water energy system transformation pathways,"sustainable development objectives surrounding water and energy are interdependent, and yet the associated performance metrics are often distinct. regional planners tasked with designing future supply systems therefore require multi criteria analysis methods and tools to determine a suitable combination of technologies and scale of investments. previous research focused on optimizing system development strategy with respect to a single design objective, leading to potentially negative outcomes for other important sustainability metrics. this paper addresses this limitation, and presents a flexible multi criteria model analysis framework that is applicable to long term energy and water supply planning at national or regional scales in an interactive setup with decision makers. the framework incorporates a linear systems engineering model of the coupled supply technologies and inter provincial transmission networks. the multi criteria analysis approach enables the specification of diverse decision making preferences for disparate criteria, and leads to quantitative understanding of trade offs between the resulting criteria values of the corresponding pareto optimal solutions. a case study of the water stressed nation of saudi arabia explores preferences combining aspiration and reservation levels in terms of cost, water sustainability and electricity sector co2 emissions. the analysis reveals a suite of trade off solutions, in which potential integrated water energy system configurations remain relatively ambitious from both an economic and environmental perspective. the results highlight the importance of identifying suitable tradeoffs between water and energy sustainability objectives during the formulation of coupled transformation strategies.

(2) thermal inertia (ti) map (for moisture content imaging) from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) data. (3) hydraulic conductivity map from mapping lithological units using the landsat oli and previously published data. (4) aquifer thickness map from previously published data. we quantitatively ranked the kharga basin by considering that regions of high fracture density, high ti, thicker aquifer, and high hydraulic conductivity have higher potential for groundwater accessibility. our analysis shows that part of the southern kharga basin is suitable for groundwater extraction. this region is where n s and e w trending faults intersect, has relatively high ti and it is underlain by thick aquifer. however, the suitability of this region for groundwater use will be reduced significantly when considering the changes in land suitability and economic depth to groundwater extraction in the next 50 years.

Pavelic et al.,2012,Agricultural Water Management,role of groundwater in buffering irrigation production against climate variability at the basin scale in south west india,"the basaltic aquifers of the upper bhima river basin in india are highly utilized for irrigation but the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals and the agricultural production systems they support is largely unknown. here we used hydrogeological data, supported by secondary data, to assess the effects of water scarcity over a decade long period (1998 2007) on the groundwater resources at the regional basin scale. this reveals no evidence of systematic declines in total groundwater availability over the period: only shorter term losses/gains in storage associated with successive dry/wet years. the clearest indicator of stress comes from the more widespread drying out of wells following lower rainfall years throughout the basin and especially in upland areas where aquifers are least developed and most easily drained. groundwater in the basin offers an adaptive mechanism to climate variability to some degree, but the buffering capacity is constrained by low aquifer storativity and average residence times of just a few years. around 40% of the basin is currently at a level of development that is of concern, and the number of irrigation wells is growing rapidly. however recent evidence of conversion from high to low water use crops indicates the adaptive capacity of farmers to water related stresses. surplus surfacewater flows may provide opportunities to enhance groundwater recharge but requires careful trade off analysis of the downstream impacts.

Pena et al.,2016,Water Resources Management,planning landscape with water infiltration. empirical model to assess maximum infiltration areas in mediterranean landscapes,"water infiltration is a natural process of landscape. the areas with high capacity to infiltrate are especially important in landscape planning, whose protection is crucial for the continuity of water flow, maximizing the recharge of aquifers, minimizing flooding risks and reduce soil erosion. the different interpretations of the criteria for the delimitation water infiltration areas, its imprecise legal nature and the progressive incentive for sustainable water and management policies, have created the need for an integrative and ecological based methodology that suppresses this gap at the landscape planning level. the aim of this research was to create a gis model, based on ecological principles, that contributes to the delimitation of the maximum infiltration areas. the mapping of water related systems guarantees the inclusion and protection of the hydrological cycle in the landscape planning. the application of the model in almada municipality, from lisbon metropolitan area, allows the integration of the maximum infiltration areas in planning, municipal management and urban design. almada is part of the recharge area of tagus river aquifer. with the application of the proposed model, we concluded that 54 % of the municipality has maximum infiltration areas and 38 % of those are already impervious due to construction works. finally, we concluded that this method should be applied in an early stage of planning, at several scales, leading to the definition of potential soil uses and priority intervention measures according with its ecological suitability."

Perez-Martin et al.,2014,Water Resources Management,"modeling water resources and river aquifer interaction in the jucar river basin, spain","the paper presents how to solve some practical problems of water planning in a medium/large river basin, such as: the water resources assessment and its spatial temporal variability over the long short term, the impact of human activities on the water cycle, due to groundwater pumping and water returns into aquifers, the river aquifer interactions and the aquifer depletion. it is based on the use of a new monthly conceptual distributed waterbalance model  patrical  that includes the surfacewater (sw), groundwater (gw) behavior and the river aquifer interaction. the model is applied to the jucar river basin district (rbd) in spain (43,000 km(2)), with more than 250 aquifers, including catchments with humid climates (jucar rbd northern), semiarid and arid catchments (southern). the model has a small number of parameters and obtains a satisfactory performance in sw and gw behavior. it has been calibrated/validated using monthly streamflows and two additional elements not generally used in models for large river basins, gw levels and river aquifer interactions. in the hydrological time series of the jucar rbd headers a statistical change point in the year 1979/80 is detected. it is due to changes in precipitation patterns and represents a 40 % of reduction in streamflows in relation with the previous period. the impact of gw pumping in all aquifers is determined, the 'mancha oriental' aquifer produces a significant reduction in streamflows of the jucar river  around 200 250 hm(3)/year. the gw level in the 'villena benejama' aquifer  vinalopo valley  has declined more than 200 m in last 30 years."
Perez-Villarreal et al.,2018,Boletin De La Sociedad Geologica Mexicana,"analysis of flux systems in an aquifer disturbed by groundwater extraction. case of the morelia capula area, michoacan","the morelia capula zone depends entirely on groundwater for the supply of its more than 120000 inhabitants. the groundwater extraction has caused a decrease in the piezometric level estimated at more than .15 meters in a period rye 21 yews. because of the importance of the aquifer system of the morelia capula zone it is necessary to have a complete understating of the system, therefore, this study it carried out from the perspective of the tothian flow systems. three parameters are used to identify the groundwater dynamics, temperature, major ions, and depth (static level). groundwater samples mere analyzed in a total of 35 sites (29 wells and 6 springs), consisting 26 intermediate, 8 local, and 1 regional flows. the local flow system is located in the upper strata of the aquifer system and can he seen within the shallow wells and springs the intermediate flow system is located throughout the study area below the local flow ?shin where most wells are extracting water from this system. the local and intermediate flow systems are localized in the terrigenous and volcanic units: the regional flow system is only in the volcanic unit that underlies the terrigenous unit. a few wells have come in contact with this system. a depletion trend shows that in the next few years this flow system will provide water to this cone. it was found that intensive extraction and the presence of geological faults favor the mixture of flows. most of the water supply in the zone depends. on the intermediate flow system. the static level in the zone descends 2.13 m/year. the flowdirection of local and intermediate systems generally plows the topography of the zone, although there are local alterations due to the formation of depletion cones. results indicate the need to implement strategies to avoid contaminating local flows and to reduce the water pressure derived from extraction toward the intermediate and regional systems."
Perri et al.,2018,Water Resources Research,plant osmoregulation as an emergent water saving adaptation,"soil salinity affects plant transpiration and growth through two main pathways: the osmotic effect of salt in the soil (osmotic stress; analogous to water stress) and the toxic effect of salt within the plant (ionic stress; salt specific). however, the drastic and sudden reduction of transpiration exhibited by most species in response to an increase of salinity in the root zone is mainly associated with the osmotic phase, while ionic stress appears at a later time, causing the premature senescence of leaves and the reduction of the plant photosynthetic area. to better investigate the effects of salinity on plant water relations, we introduce a parsimonious soil plant atmosphere continuum (spac) model accounting for both salt exclusion at the root level and osmoregulation i.e.,the adjustment of internal water potential in response to salt stress. the model is used to interpret a paradox observed in salt tolerant species where transpiration is maximum at an intermediate value of salinity (c tr,c max), and is lower in more fresh (c < c tr,c max) and more saline (c > c tr,c max) conditions. such nonmonotonic transpiration salt concentration (t r c) patterns can be largely explained by plant osmoregulation, while the peak of transpiration at c tr,c  max tends to disappear over longer time scales, when ionic stress appears and morphological adaptations become predominant. osmoregulation emerges here as a water saving behavior similar to the strategies that xerophytes use to cope with aridity. the maximum of transpiration at c tr,c  max is thus the result of a trade off between the enhancement of salt tolerance and optimal carbon assimilation. plain language summary soil salinization represents a major threat for the food security and sustainable development of drylands, with salt affected soils presently covering more than 9 billion ha worldwide expected to further increase due to climate change, landuse modifications and erroneous irrigation/groundwater abstraction practices. despite this fact, the effects of salinity on the rate at which plants transpire and grow in salt affected soils are rarely considered in ecological and ecohydrological models, and the different processes leading to salt tolerance are yet poorly understood. here, we introduce a simple model of how salt tolerant species adapt to elevated salt concentrations in the soil, and of how such adaptations substantially lead to plant osmoregulation, as an emergent water saving behavior similar to the strategies that aridity tolerant species (xerophytes) use to cope with extreme water scarcity. the bottom line is that salt tolerant plants experience salt stress as an alternative form of water limitation, and developed both short and long term adaptations accordingly. our findings are instrumental to a better comprehension of the interplay between soil salinization, salt tolerance and efficient water use that is, in turn, the key to understand the potential of salt tolerant crops and contrast soil salinization."
Petersen-Perlman et al.,2018,Water,critical issues affecting groundwater quality governance and management in the united states,"groundwater is increasingly important for meeting water demand across the united states (u.s.). forward thinking governance and effective management are necessary for its sustainable use. in the u.s., state governments are primarily responsible for groundwater governance (i.e., making laws, policies, and regulations) and management (i.e., implementation of laws, policies, and regulations). this decentralized system results in diverse strategies and practices. we surveyed a water quality professional from each state to better understand commonalities and differences across states. these professionals identify a wide assortment of groundwater issues and concerns, including quality and quantity impairment, staffing and budget issues, private well vulnerability, and overdraft. respondents indicate contamination problems from natural and anthropogenic sources. most respondents report that their states have significantly changed groundwater quality policy during the past 30 years. while most states have multiple funding sources for water quality programs, program budgets have decreased in the last decade, thereby hindering effective implementation of new policies. over half of respondents indicate that water quality/water level monitoring and increased groundwater pumping will require more attention over the next decade. several respondents anticipate groundwater regulation changes in the next five years. we discuss how our findings align with current groundwater uses in the u.s."
Peterson et al.,2013,Water Resources Management,water resources sustainability indicator: application of the watershed characteristics approach,"the quantification of the renewable flux (i.e. sustainable limit) of the hydrologic system is the prerequisite for transitioning from unsustainable to sustainable water resources management. the application of the watershed characteristics approach to estimate the renewable flux of the hydrologic system was demonstrated using minnesota's (usa) twin cities metropolitan area (tcma). the methodology quantified the relationships between landscape properties and waterbalance characteristics, resulting in the development of functioning hierarchical hydrogeological units with corresponding recharge rates. this renewable flux is a key quantitative characteristic for the assessment of a sustainability indicator. the key indicator of sustainable water use is the ratio of the renewable capacity of the hydrologic system to the water use by humans and the environment. by incorporating water use estimates for the tcma relative to the calculated recharge rates, sustainability indicators for groundwater and total flux were calculated for the metropolitan area. as far back as the 1890s, declines in tcma groundwater levels have been observed, which correspond to the unsustainable groundwater extraction estimates identified in the results of this study. the non stationary characteristics of urban watersheds influenced by ongoing landuse/land cover changes as illustrated in this paper, emphasizes the need for conservative hydrologic planning to achieve sustainable water management. this approach can also be applied to other metropolitan areas as a hydrologic tool for decision makers to design sustainable water policy and prevent the over extraction of the water flowing through the hydrologic system."
Peterson et al.,2014,Water Resources Research,nonlinear time series modeling of unconfined groundwater head,"this paper presents a nonlinear transfer function noise model for time series modeling of unconfined groundwater hydrographs. the motivation for its development was that existing groundwater time series models were unable to simulate large recharge events and multiyear droughts. this was because existing methods do not partition rainfall to runoff and do not account for nonlinear soil water drainage. to account for these nonlinear processes, a vertically integrated soil moisture module was added to an existing transfer function noise model. the soil moisture module has a highly flexible structure that allowed 84 different forms to be built. application of the time series model requires numerical calibration of parameters for the transfer functions, noise model and, for the nonlinear models, the soil moisture module. this was undertaken using the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (cma es) global calibration scheme. however, reproducible calibration to the global optima was challenging and a number of modifications were required to the transfer function noise model. in trialing the 84 nonlinear models and 2 linear models, each was applied to eleven observation bores within a paired catchment study area in great western, victoria, australia. in comparison with existing groundwater hydrograph time series models, the proposed nonlinear time series model performed significantly better at all observation bores during calibration and evaluation periods. both the linear and nonlinear models were also used to quantify the impact of revegetation within the paired catchment; however, results were inconclusive, which is likely due to time series data for the state of the revegetation being unavailable. by analyzing the application of 84 nonlinear models to each bore, an optimal structure for the soil moisture module was identified. it is unlikely, however, that this model structure would be appropriate for all climates and geologies. to encourage further investigations, open source code for the highly flexible groundwater time series modeling framework is available and we invite others to develop new models. key points <list id=""wrcr21157 list 0001"" list type=""bulleted""> <list item id=""wrcr21157 li 0001"">groundwater hydrograph models cannot simulate episodic recharge and droughts <list item id=""wrcr21157 li 0002"">nonlinear transformation of climate forcing overcame these weaknesses <list item id=""wrcr21157 li 0003"">robust calibration required reformulation of existing time series equations <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1002/(issn)1944 7973</doi"
Petit et al.,2017,Hydrogeology Journal,can agricultural groundwater economies collapse? an inquiry into the pathways of four groundwater economies under threat,"the aim of this paper is to investigate the notion of collapse of agricultural groundwater economies using the adaptive cycle analytical framework. this framework was applied to four case studies in southern europe and north africa to question and discuss the dynamics of agricultural groundwater economies. in two case studies (saiss in morocco and clain basin in france), the imminent physical or socio economic collapse was a major concern for stakeholders and the early signs of collapse led to re organization of the groundwater economy. in the other two cases (biskra in algeria and almeria in spain), collapse was either not yet a concern or had been temporarily resolved through increased efficiency and access to additional water resources. this comparative analysis shows the importance of taking the early signs of collapse into account. these signs can be either related to resource depletion or to environmental and socio economic impacts. beyond these four case studies, the large number of groundwater economies under threat in (semi )arid areas should present a warning regarding their possible collapse. collapse can have severe and irreversible consequences in some cases, but it can also mean new opportunities and changes."

Pierce et al.,2013,Hydrogeology Journal,aquifer yield continuum as a guide and typology for science based groundwater management,"groundwater availability is at the core of hydrogeology as a discipline and, simultaneously, the concept is the source of ambiguity for management and policy. aquifer yield has undergone multiple definitions resulting in a range of scientific methods to calculate and model availability reflecting the complexity of combined scientific, management, policy, and stakeholder processes. the concept of an aquifer yield continuum provides an approach to classify groundwater yields along a spectrum, from non use through permissive sustained, sustainable, maximum sustained, safe, permissive mining to maximum mining yields, that builds on existing literature. additionally, the aquifer yield continuum provides a systems view of groundwater availability to integrate physical and social aspects in assessing management options across aquifer settings. operational yield describes the candidate solutions for operational or technical implementation of policy, often relating to a consensus yield that incorporates human dimensions through participatory or adaptive governance processes. the concepts of operational and consensus yield address both the social and the technical nature of science based groundwater management and governance."
Pilo et al.,2018,Marine Environmental Research,are submarine groundwater discharges affecting the structure and physiological status of rocky intertidal communities?,"this study evaluated the impacts of submarine groundwater discharges (sgd) on a rocky intertidal community of south portugal, during april november 2011. chlorophyll a concentration was higher at the sgd site in respect to the reference site. epibenthic community structure differed between sites, with an increase in chthamalus spp. and a decrease in macroalgae coverage at the sgd site. the abundance and body size of mytilus galloprovincialis were consistently higher at the sgd site. during mid spring, under potentially higher sgd and less favorable conditions for coastal phytoplankton, the ecophysiological condition of m. galloprovincialis and g. umbilicalis was also higher at the sgd site. these beneficial effects on filter feeders and herbivores probably resulted from local increases in prey availability, supported by sgd driven nutrient inputs. conversely, p. depressa was not favoured by sgd, probably due to a lower dependency on algae as food. the analysis of epibenthic community structure and ecophysiological condition represents a promising approach to disentangle the ecological impacts of sgd on intertidal ecosystems."
Piscopo et al.,2019,Groundwater,sustainable yield of a hydrothermal area: from theoretical concepts to the practical approach,"sustainable use of groundwater in the hydrothermal area of viterbo (central italy) was analyzed. in this area, multipurposes utilization of groundwater coexists: several thermal springs and wells supply spas and public pools, cold and fresh water is used for irrigation and drinking water. starting from theoretical concepts, a management plan has been developed to ensure groundwater sustainability in response to the increased demand of withdrawal from thermal wells, by integrating previous hydrogeological studies, new investigations and a new finite difference model. the most stringent constraints considered are: to maintain the quality of thermal and fresh waters, to limit the effects on the hydraulic equilibrium existing between overlapping aquifers, to ensure a significant flow to the natural thermal springs and the quality and flow rate of the spring used for drinking purposes. the practical approach included identification of the maximum pumping rate from the wells of the spas, analysis of the response time of the system under development and drafting of a safeguard and monitoring plan. the case examined takes into account the complexity of the task in defining practical measures for groundwater management on the basis of theoretical concepts of its sustainable use. a participative approach among the different water decision makers and adaptivemanagement in the use of groundwater resources with different quality represent the key points to overcome conflicts between different users, with the awareness of the ineludible uncertainties of the hydrogeological model."
Pool et al.,2011,Water Resources Research,a correction factor to account for mixing in ghyben herzberg and critical pumping rate approximations of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"the classic ghyben herzberg estimate of the depth of the freshwater saltwater interface together with the dupuit approximation is a useful tool for developing analytical solutions to many seawater intrusion problems. on the basis of these assumptions, strack (1976) developed a single potential theory to calculate critical pumping rates in a coastal pumping scenario. the sharp interface assumption and, in particular, this analytical solution are widely used to study seawater intrusion and the sustainable management of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers. the sharp interface assumption neglects mixing and implicitly assumes that salt water remains static. consequently, this approximation overestimates the penetration of the saltwater front and underestimates the critical pumping rates that ensure a freshwater supply. we investigate the error introduced by adopting the sharp interface approximation, and we include the effects of dispersion on the formulation of strack (1976). to this end, we perform numerical three dimensional variable density flow simulations. we find that strack's equations can be extended to the case of mixing zone if the density factor is multiplied by an empirically derived dispersion factor [1   (alpha(t)/b')(1/6)], where alpha(t) is transverse dispersivity and b' is aquifer thickness. we find that this factor can be used not only to estimate the critical pumping rate but also to correct the ghyben herzberg estimate of the interface depth. its simplicity facilitates the generalization of sharp interface analytical solutions and good predictions of seawater penetration for a broad range of conditions."

Pulido-Velazquez et al.,2018,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,integrated assessment of future potential global change scenarios and their hydrological impacts in coastal aquifers   a new tool to analyse management alternatives in the plana oropesa torreblanca aquifer,"any change in the components of the waterbalance in a coastal aquifer, whether natural or anthropogenic, can alter the freshwater salt water equilibrium. in this sense climate change (cc) and landuse and land cover (lulc) change might significantly influence the availability of groundwater resources in the future. these coastal systems demand an integrated analysis of quantity and quality issues to obtain an appropriate assessment of hydrological impacts using density dependent flow solutions. the aim of this work is to perform an integrated analysis of future potential global change (gc) scenarios and their hydrological impacts in a coastal aquifer, the plana oropesa torreblanca aquifer. it is a mediterranean aquifer that extends over 75 km(2) in which important historical lulc changes have been produced and are planned for the future. future cc scenarios will be defined by using an equi feasible and non feasible ensemble of projections based on the results of a multi criteria analysis of the series generated from several regional climatic models with different downscaling approaches. the hydrological impacts of these cc scenarios combined with future lulc scenarios will be assessed with a chain of models defined by a sequential coupling of rainfall recharge models, crop irrigation requirements and irrigation return models (for the aquifer and its neighbours that feed it), and a density dependent aquifer approach. this chain of models, calibrated using the available historical data, allow testing of the conceptual approximation of the aquifer behaviour. they are also fed with series representatives of potential global change scenarios in order to perform a sensitivityanalysis regarding future scenarios of rainfall recharge, lateral flows coming from the hydraulically connected neighbouring aquifer, agricultural recharge (taking into account expected future lulc changes) and sea level rise (slr). the proposed analysis is valuable for improving our knowledge about the aquifer, and so comprises a tool to design sustainable adaptation management strategies taking into account the uncertainty in future gc conditions and their impacts. the results show that gc scenarios produce significant increases in the variability of flow budget components and in the salinity."
Pulido-Velazquez et al.,2015,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,integrated assessment of the impact of climate and landuse changes on groundwater quantity and quality in the mancha oriental system (spain),"climate and landuse change (global change) impacts on groundwater systems cannot be studied in isolation. landuse and land cover (lulc) changes have a great impact on the water cycle and contaminant production and transport. groundwater flow and storage are changing in response not only to climatic changes but also to human impacts on landuses and demands, which will alter the hydrologic cycle and subsequently impact the quantity and quality of regional water systems. predicting groundwater recharge and discharge conditions under future climate and landuse changes is essential for integrated water management and adaptation. in the mancha oriental system (mos), one of the largest groundwater bodies in spain, the transformation from dry to irrigated lands during the last decades has led to a significant drop of the groundwatertable, with the consequent effect on stream aquifer interaction in the connected jucar river. understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of water quantity and water quality is essential for a proper management of the system. on the one hand, streamflow depletion is compromising the dependent ecosystems and the supply to the downstream demands, provoking a complex management issue. on the other hand, the intense use of fertilizer in agriculture is leading to locally high groundwater nitrate concentrations. in this paper we analyze the potential impacts of climate and landuse change in the system by using an integrated modeling framework that consists in sequentially coupling a watershed agriculturally based hydrological model (soil and water assessment tool, swat) with a groundwater flow model developed in modflow, and with a nitrate mass transport model in mt3dms. swat model outputs (mainly groundwater recharge and pumping, considering new irrigation needs under changing evapotranspiration (et) and precipitation) are used as modflow inputs to simulate changes in groundwater flow and storage and impacts on stream aquifer interaction. swat and modflow outputs (nitrate loads from swat, groundwater velocity field from modflow) are used as mt3dms inputs for assessing the fate and transport of nitrate leached from the topsoil. three climate change scenarios have been considered, corresponding to three different general circulation models (GCM) for emission scenario a1b that covers the control period, and short , medium and long term future periods. a multi temporal analysis of lulc change was carried out, helped by the study of historical trends (from remote sensing images) and key driving forces to explain lulc transitions. markov chains and european scenarios and projections were used to quantify trends in the future. the cellular automata technique was applied for stochastic modeling future lulc maps. simulated values of river discharge, crop yields, groundwater levels and nitrate concentrations fit well to the observed ones. the results show the response of groundwater quantity and quality (nitrate pollution) to climate and landuse changes, with decreasing groundwater recharge and an increase in nitrate concentrations. the sequential modeling chain has been proven to be a valuable assessment tool for supporting the development of sustainable management strategies."

Qian et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,"hydrochemical processes and evolution of karst groundwater in the northeastern huaibei plain, china","major ion geochemistry reveals that the hydrochemical evolutionary process of karst groundwater in the northeastern huaibei plain, china, consists of three sub processes: the dissolution of dolomite, gypsum dissolution with dedolomitization, and mixing with overlying pore water. understanding hydrochemical evolution has been an important topic in understanding the history, status, and dynamics of the groundwater flow system. the presented study found a hydrochemical boundary roughly corresponding to the thickness of overlying strata equating to 50 m depth, indicating two flow compartments participating in different hydrological cycles a local shallow rapidly replenished compartment showing lower and more stable main ion concentrations, and a regional deep flow compartment showing higher and sporadic concentrations of na+, k+, ca2+, mg2+, cl  and so4 (2 ), as well as high total dissolved solids (tds), total hardness, and sodium adsorption ratio (sar). in areas with aquifers with low water transmitting ability, groundwater samples show a high chloride ratio and elevated tds values, indicating salinization of groundwater due to stagnant water flows. analyses of the data on the saturation indexes and mineral solutions, in tandem with trilinear diagram analysis and petrological observations, indicate that dedolomitization is the dominant process controlling the chemical characteristics of karst groundwater in the study area. groundwater and pore water mixing was also observed at the later evolutionary stage of groundwater flow, demonstrating frequent groundwater/pore water interactions where groundwater is recharged by pore water due to lower groundwater level in the study area."
Qin et al.,2013,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,integrated hydrological modeling of the north china plain and implications for sustainable water management,"groundwater overdraft has caused fast water level decline in the north china plain (ncp) since the 1980s. although many hydrological models have been developed for the ncp in the past few decades, most of them deal only with the groundwater component or only at local scales. in the present study, a coupled surfacewater groundwater model using the mike she code has been developed for the entire alluvial plain of the ncp. all the major processes in the land phase of the hydrological cycle are considered in the integrated modeling approach. the most important parameters of the model are first identified by a sensitivityanalysis process and then calibrated for the period 2000 2005. the calibrated model is validated for the period 2006 2008 against daily observations of groundwater heads. the simulation results compare well with the observations where acceptable values of root mean square error (rmse) (most values lie below 4 m) and correlation coefficient (r) (0.36 0.97) are obtained. the simulated evapotranspiration (et) is then compared with the remote sensing (rs) based et data to further validate the model simulation. the comparison result with a r 2 value of 0.93 between the monthly averaged values of simulated actual evapotranspiration (aet) and rs aet for the entire ncp shows a good performance of the model. the waterbalance results indicate that more than 70% of water leaving the flow system is attributed to the et component, of which about 0.25% is taken from the saturated zone (sz); about 29% comes from pumping, including irrigation pumping and non irrigation pumping (net pumping). sustainable water management analysis of the ncp is conducted using the simulation results obtained from the integrated model. an effective approach to improve water use efficiency in the ncp is by reducing the actual et, e. g. by introducing water saving technologies and changes in cropping."
Quba'a et al.,2018,Environmental Earth Sciences,modeling the depletion of groundwater storage over time in the levant: lessons learned from a water stressed region,"globally, the demand for water is continuously increasing, placing many regions under the burden of water stress thus leading to transboundary water conflicts and overexploitation of existing water resources. managing water resources in many of these water stressed regions are hampered by the lack of long term spatio temporal observations of surface and groundwater resources and an inadequate understanding of changes associated with increased groundwater pumping. in this study, observational data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment are combined with data from the global land data assimilation system land surface models to assess regional changes in water storage over time in the water stressed levant region of the middle east. results show that the levant has been witnessing an overall drop in its total water storage at a rate of 10.64 +/  0.48 mm/year, equivalent to the loss of 80% of the volume of lake tiberias the largest natural freshwater body in the region. more than 90% of the water losses were attributed to overexploitation of groundwater resources, with annual groundwater losses estimated to exceed 40% of the consumed groundwater. time series analysis of changes in total water storage supports a temporally constant loss rate rather than an abrupt change to the system instigated by the onset of the 2007 regional drought, which severely affected the wider middle east region. an assessment of current and projected non conventional water supply projects in the region show that their capacities will be limited to less than 40% of the model estimated annual drop in groundwater storage. these findings highlight the importance of increasing water use efficiency, particularly in the agricultural sector in an effort to reverse the groundwater storage losses."

Racz et al.,2012,Ground Water,spatial and temporal infiltration dynamics during managed aquifer recharge,"natural groundwater recharge is inherently difficult to quantify and predict, largely because it comprises a series of processes that are spatially distributed and temporally variable. infiltration ponds used for managed aquifer recharge (mar) provide an opportunity to quantify recharge processes across multiple scales under semi controlled conditions. we instrumented a 3 ha mar infiltration pond to measure and compare infiltration patterns determined using whole pond and point specific methods. whole pond infiltration was determined by closing a transient waterbudget (accounting for inputs, outputs, and changes in storage), whereas point specific infiltration rates were determined using heat as a tracer and time series analysis at eight locations in the base of the pond. whole pond infiltration, normalized for wetted area, rose rapidly to more than 1.0 m/d at the start of mar operations (increasing as pond stage rose), was sustained at high rates for the next 40 d, and then decreased to less than 0.1 m/d by the end of the recharge season. point specific infiltration rates indicated high spatial and temporal variability, with the mean of measured values generally being lower than rates indicated by whole pond calculations. colocated measurements of head gradients within saturated soils below the pond were combined with infiltration rates to calculate soil hydraulic conductivity. observations indicate a brief period of increasing saturated hydraulic conductivity, followed by a decrease of one to two orders of magnitude during the next 50 to 75 d. locations indicating the most rapid infiltration shifted laterally during mar operation, and we suggest that infiltration may function as a variable source area processes, conceptually similar to catchment runoff."
Rahaman et al.,2019,Hydrology,modeling of grace derived groundwater information in the colorado river basin,"groundwater depletion has been one of the major challenges in recent years. analysis of groundwater levels can be beneficial for groundwater management. the national aeronautics and space administration's twin satellite, gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace), serves in monitoring terrestrial water storage. increasing freshwater demand amidst recent drought (2000 2014) posed a significant groundwater level decline within the colorado river basin (crb). in the current study, a non parametric technique was utilized to analyze historical groundwater variability. additionally, a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) model was developed and tested to forecast the grace derived groundwater anomalies within the crb. the arima model was trained with the grace data from january 2003 to december of 2013 and validated with grace data from january 2014 to december of 2016. groundwater anomaly from january 2017 to december of 2019 was forecasted with the tested model. autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots were drawn to identify and construct the seasonal arima models. arima order for each grid was evaluated based on akaike's and bayesian information criterion. the error analysis showed the reasonable numerical accuracy of selected seasonal arima models. the proposed models can be used to forecast groundwater variability for sustainable groundwater planning and management."

Ranjan et al.,2013,Natural Resource Modeling,mathematical modeling of drought resilience in agriculture,". ensuring drought resilience for farmers is an important policy concern. yet, a quantitative treatment of the concept of drought resilience has been lacking in the literature. this paper designs a mathematical model of drought resilience to assess farmers' survival strategies when faced with the prospect of repeated droughts. a key distinction is being made here between consecutive droughts and one off droughts, as it is the former, which is of most concern to farmers as well as policy makers. the mathematical model is generalized to incorporate the possibility of more than one set of a certain number of consecutive droughts occurring in the future. findings indicate varying implications for groundwater sustainability when resilience outcomes are directly linked to the length of a farmer's drought planning horizon as well as to the planned minimum consumption during drought years."
Rao et al.,2014,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,application of electrical resistivity tomography methods for delineation of groundwater contamination and potential zones,"identification of damages/changes that are affecting the undergroundwater quality due to the effect of anthropogenic activities is often done after environmental problems have become evident or water portability being strongly affected. two main applications of electrical resistivity tomography (ert) methods have been addressed covering characterization of leachate movement from a composting area of a sugar mill in southern india. good correlation has been obtained between ert and groundwater quality assessments as well as from groundwater monitoring data sets. the study helped in conceptualization of hydrogeologic framework in basaltic terrain. impacts on groundwater regime associated with urbanization and industrialization can easily be assessed through the variation of resistivity in the inverse resistivity pseudo section model of the ert investigations. assessment of groundwater potential in an upcoming urban node, greater hyderabad city has been illustrated in the second example. identification of good thickness of weathered regolith for location of water harvesting through green fingers evolved. the small infrastructure would help carrying of enhanced surface runoff as well as to sustain groundwater yield in the urban node and thereby ensuring sustainable groundwater resource exploitation. the above studies have illustrated immense potential of the ert tools in the assessment of groundwater contamination as well as groundwater potential."
Rao et al.,2017,Environmental Earth Sciences,"observing changes in groundwater resource using hydro chemical and isotopic parameters: a case study from bist doab, punjab","the continuous and large scale abstraction of groundwater has created a groundwater depletion problem in several parts of the punjab state including bist doab, the interfluve region of beas and satluj rivers. in the present study, a few important parameters, viz. water level, stable isotope, ec, temperature, groundwater age, that can be used to fingerprint the overexploitation of groundwater have been examined. it has been observed that with the increase in overexploitation, the yield of shallow aquifer is progressively getting reduced and as a result forcing the farmers to sink their wells to deeper depths. with abstraction of deeper aquifer, the storage of old groundwater at the deeper aquifer is declining and getting replaced by induced accelerated inflow of young water from the recharge zone and the overlying shallow aquifer. the signatures of the modern water have been observed in the data analyzed for isotopic, hydro chemical facies, electrical conductivity and temperature of water from deeper aquifer. the study has identified the usefulness of these parameters for identifying groundwater overexploitation in the region. depleting water resource may stagnate the economic progress of the region. the paper provides suitable water resource management strategies to be adopted to improve the sustainability of water resources and economic growth in the region."
Rashid et al.,2017,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,integrated multi parameter approach for delineating groundwater potential zones in a crystalline aquifer of southern india,"groundwater resources in the semi arid regions of southern india are under immense pressure due to large scale groundwater abstraction vis a vis meager rainfall recharge. therefore, understanding and evaluating the spatial distribution of groundwater is essential for viable utilization of the resource. here, we assess groundwater potential at the watershed scale, in a semi arid environment with crystalline aquifer system without a perennial surfacewater source using remote sensing, geophysical, and gis based integrated multi parameter approach. gis based weighed overlay analysis is performed with input parameters, viz., geology, geomorphology, lineament density, landuse, soil, drainage density, slope, and aquifer thickness. the watershed is categorized into four zones, namely, ""very good"" (gwp4), ""good"" (gwp3), ""moderate"" (gwp2), and ""low"" (gwp1) in terms of groundwater potential. overall, similar to 70% of the study area falls under moderate to low groundwater potential, indicating a serious threat to the future availability of the resource. therefore, serious measures are required for maintaining aquifer resilience in this over exploited aquifer (e.g., restricting groundwater withdrawal from gwp1 and gwp2 zones). further, as the aquifer is under tremendous anthropogenic pressure, rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge during monsoon are advocated for sustainable aquifer management. due to the direct dependence of crop production vis a vis farmer economy on groundwater, this study is an important step towards sustainable groundwater management and can be applied in diverse hydrological terrains."
Rasmussen et al.,2013,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"assessing impacts of climate change, sea level rise, and drainage canals on saltwater intrusion to coastal aquifer","groundwater abstraction from coastal aquifers is vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise because both may potentially impact saltwater intrusion and hence groundwater quality depending on the hydrogeological setting. in the present study the impacts of sea level rise and changes in groundwater recharge are quantified for an island located in the western baltic sea. the low lying central area of the investigated part of the island was extensively drained and reclaimed during the second half of the 19th century by a system of artificial drainage canals that significantly affects the flow dynamics of the area. the drinking water, mainly for summer cottages, is abstracted from 11 wells drilled to a depth of around 20 m into the upper 5 10 m of a confined chalk aquifer, and the total pumping is only 5 6% of the drainage pumping. increasing chloride concentrations have been observed in several abstraction wells and in some cases the who drinking water standard has been exceeded. using the modeling package modflow/mt3d/seawat the historical, present and future freshwater sea water distribution is simulated. the model is calibrated against hydraulic head observations and validated against geochemical and geophysical data from new investigation wells, including borehole logs, and from an airborne transient electromagnetic survey. the impact of climate changes on saltwater intrusion is found to be sensitive to the boundarycondition of the investigated system. for the flux controlled aquifer to the west of the drained area only changes in groundwater recharge impacts the freshwater sea water interface whereas sea level rise does not result in increasing sea water intrusion. however, on the barrier islands to the east of the reclaimed area, below which the sea is hydraulically connected to the drainage canals, and the boundary of the flow system therefore controlled, the projected changes in sea level, groundwater recharge and stage of the drainage canals all have significant impacts on saltwater intrusion and the chloride concentrations found in abstraction wells."
Rassam et al.,2011,Environmental Modelling & Software,a conceptual framework for incorporating surface groundwater interactions into a river operation planning model,"groundwater discharge constitutes a significant proportion of the total flow volume in most rivers. the exchange flux between surface and groundwater greatly impacts the surface as well as the groundwaterbalance with serious implications on ecosystem health especially during low flow conditions. there is a move towards conjunctive river aquifer management with the integration of surface groundwater exchange fluxes into surface and groundwater models to manage water as a single resource. groundwater surfacewater (gw sw) exchange fluxes are seldom integrated into river operation and planning models. the time lags associated with the impacts of groundwater processes on nearby rivers can greatly compromise the forecasting capacity of river models especially during low flow conditions. this paper presents a conceptual framework for integrating gw sw exchange fluxes into the new generation river operation planning model 'source integrated modelling system'. the proposed gw sw link module adopts a simple pragmatic approach for estimating the exchange fluxes between a river reach and the underlying aquifer using explicit analytical solutions. this flux becomes an inflow/outflow to that river reach and forms part of the routing and calibration processes. the exchange flux comprises four components: (1) natural exchange flux resulting from river stage fluctuations during low flow conditions, within bank and overbank fluctuations; (2) flux due to groundwater extraction; (3) flux due to changes in aquifer recharge; and (4) flux due to changes in evapotranspiration. the sum of those components during every time step dictates whether the river loses water to or gains water from the aquifer. the proposed analytical solutions were found to provide flux predictions that agree favourably with those derived from a numerical groundwater model. recognising that the simplifying assumptions that underpin the explicit analytical solution are likely to be violated in the natural world, a suite of criteria was recommended for their use under many violating conditions related to boundarycondition, head gradients, and aquifer heterogeneity. low flow indices were adopted to demonstrate the critical role of gw sw exchange flux when predicting river low flows. explicit accounting of gw sw interactions into river operation and planning models greatly enhances their forecasting capacity during low flow conditions.

Rassam et al.,2017,Marine and Freshwater Research,non stationarity of low flows and their relevance to river modelling during drought periods,"changes in groundwater storage lead to a reduction in groundwater contribution to river flow and present as non stationarity, especially during low flow conditions. conventional river models typically ignore this non stationarity, and, hence, their predictions of declines in low flows during drought periods are likely to be compromised. the present study assesses non stationarity and highlights its implications for river modelling. a quantile regression analysis showed non stationarity of low flows in the namoi catchment (australia), with statistically significant downward trends in the 10th percentile of log transformed baseflow (10 ltb). this highlighted the usefulness of the 10 ltb metric to identify non stationarity and, hence, alert modellers to the importance of adopting models that explicitly account for groundwater processes when modelling such river systems."
Rassam et al.,2013,Environmental Modelling & Software,"accounting for surface groundwater interactions and their uncertainty in river and groundwater models: a case study in the namoi river, australia","surface groundwater (sw gw) interactions constitute a critical proportion of the surface and groundwaterbalance especially during dry conditions. conjunctive management of surface and groundwater requires an explicit account of the exchange flux between surface and groundwater when modelling the two systems. this paper presents a case study in the predominantly gaining boggabri narrabri reach of the namoi river located in eastern australia. the first component of the study uses the upper namoi numerical groundwater model to demonstrate the importance of incorporating sw gw interactions into river management models. the second component demonstrates the advantages of incorporating groundwater processes in the namoi river model. results of the numerical groundwater modelling component highlighted the contrasting groundwater dynamics close to, and away from the namoi river where lower declines were noted in a near field well due to water replenishment sourced from river depletion. the contribution of pumping activities to river depletion was highlighted in the results of the uncertainty analysis, which showed that the sw gw exchange flux is the most sensitive to pumping rate during dry conditions. the uncertainty analysis also showed that after a drought period, the 95% prediction interval becomes larger than the simulated flux, which implies an increasing probability of losing river conditions. the future prospect of a gaining boggabri narrabri reach turning into losing was confirmed with a hypothetical extended drought scenario during which persistent expansion of groundwater pumping was assumed. the river modelling component showed that accounting for sw gw interactions improved the predictions of low flows, and resulted in a more realistic calibration of the namoi river model. incorporating sw gw interactions into river models allows explicit representation of groundwater processes that provides a mechanism to account for the impacts of additional aquifer stresses that may be introduced beyond the calibration period of the river model. conventional river models that neglect the effects of such future stresses suffer from the phenomenon of non stationarity and hence have inferior low flow predictions past the calibration period of the river model. the collective knowledge acquired from the two modelling exercises conducted in this study leads to a better understanding of sw gw interactions in the namoi river thus leading to improved water management especially during low flow conditions. crown copyright (c) 2013 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."

Raul et al.,2011,Hydrological Processes,integrated water resource management in a major canal command in eastern india,"the present rice dominated cropping system in the hirakud canal command (eastern india) is under severe threat due to imbalance between irrigation water supply and demand. the canal water supply, which is the only source of irrigation, only meets 54% of the demand at 90% probability of exceedance (pe). in order to mitigate the irrigation water deficit from canal water, groundwater is considered as a supplemental source. quasi three dimensional groundwater flow simulation modelling was, therefore, carried out by using visual modflow to detect the change in hydraulic head due to transient pumping stresses. the simulation model was calibrated and validated satisfactorily. sensitivityanalysis of the model parameters shows that groundwater recharge is most sensitive followed by aquifer hydraulic conductivity at almost all the sites of the command area, whereas the model is comparatively less sensitive to specific storage and specific yield. enhanced pumping scenarios showed that groundwater extraction can be increased up to 50 times of the existing pumping without causing any adverse effect to the aquifer but the aquifer does not permit to exploit water in order to fulfill the irrigation water demand even at 10% pe. hence, it is imperative to develop an optimal land and water resources management plan of the command area. copyright.

Ravenscroft et al.,2013,Science of the Total Environment,stable groundwater quality in deep aquifers of southern bangladesh: the case against sustainable abstraction,"in forty six wells >150 m deep, from across the arsenic polluted area of south central bangladesh, groundwater composition remained unchanged between 1998 and 2011. no evidence of deteriorating water quality was found in terms of arsenic, iron, manganese, boron, barium or salinity over this period of 13 years. these deep tubewells have achieved operating lives of more than 20 years with minimal institutional support. these findings confirm that tubewells tapping the deep aquifers in the bengal basin provide a safe, popular, and economic, means of arsenic mitigation and are likely to do so for decades to come. nevertheless, concerns remain about the sustainability of a resource that could serve as a source of as safe water to mitigate as pollution in shallower aquifers in an area where tens of millions of people are exposed to dangerous levels of arsenic in well water. the conjunction of the stable composition in deep groundwater and the severe adverse health effects of arsenic in shallow groundwater lead us to challenge the notion that strong sustainability principles should be applied to the management of deep aquifer abstraction in bangladesh is, the notion that the deep groundwater resource should be preserved for future generations by protecting it from adverse impacts, probably of a minor nature, that could occur after a long time and might not happen at all. instead, we advocate an ethical approach to development of the deep aquifer, based on adaptive abstraction management, which allows possibly unsustainable exploitation now in order to alleviate crippling disease and death from arsenic today while also benefiting future generations by improving the health, education and economy of living children.

Raza et al.,2019,Environmental Earth Sciences,estimation of quantitative spatial and temporal distribution for groundwater storage in agricultural basin of korea: implications for rational water use,"assessment of spatio temporal variability in groundwater storage (gws) is critical for effective water resource planning and management with rational groundwater use. haean basin comprising 64km(2) area, mainly depends on groundwater for agricultural, domestic and other wateruses. for quantification of gws variability, sufficient field based hydrological data of the ongoing decade (2011 2017) were interpolated in arcgis, to give reliable results. despite satellite remote sensing having advantages in the field of hydrology, the limitation of accessibility at larger spatial resolution (200,000km(2)) is making it non applicable for fine scale observations. from the surface area, saturated thickness and specific yield of aquifer, a decline of 33million cubic meters in gws volume was indicated from 230 to 197 during the observed 6years. an observable drop (4.6m) in the mean water level due to increased water use (0.49mcm) during this decade is responsible for the change in the mean groundwater level. a changing water level can change the surface area and saturated thickness of aquifer that have a positive correlation with gws, and act as main controlling factors for gws change. an annual recharge of 0.14m to the total amount of gws is near negligible, considering the long term sustainability of groundwater resource. a shift towards more use of surfacewater, and limited drilling of groundwater wells is recommended for rational water use. the findings of this study will provide basic knowledge for relating studies, specifically which are based on small (local) scale distribution of groundwater resource."

Re et al.,2017,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,tackling the salinity pollution nexus in coastal aquifers from arid regions using nitrate and boron isotopes,"salinization and nitrate pollution are generally ascertained as the main issues affecting coastal aquifers worldwide. in arid zones, where agricultural activities also result in soil salinization, both phenomena tend to co exist and synergically contribute to alter groundwater quality, with severe negative impacts on human populations and natural ecosystems' wellbeing. it becomes therefore necessary to understand if and to what extent integrated hydrogeochemical tools can help in distinguishing among possible different salinization and nitrate contamination origins, in order to provide adequate science based support to local development and environmental protection. the alluvial plain of bou areg (north morocco) extends over about 190 km(2) and is separated from the mediterranean sea by the coastal lagoon of nador. its surface is covered for more than 60% by agricultural activities, although the region has been recently concerned by urban population increase and tourismexpansion. all these activities mainly rely on groundwater exploitation and at the same time are the main causes of both aquifer and lagoon water quality degradation. for this reason, it was chosen as a case study representative of the typical situation of coastal aquifers in arid zones worldwide, where a clear identification of salinization and pollution sources is fundamental for the implementation of locally oriented remedies and long term management strategies. results of a hydrogeochemical investigation performed between 2009 and 2011 show that the bou areg aquifer presents high salinity (often exceeding 100 mg/l in tds) due to both natural and anthropogenic processes. the area is also impacted by nitrate contamination, with concentrations generally exceeding the who statutory limits for drinking water (50 mg/l) and reaching up to about 300 mg/l, in both the rural and urban/peri urban areas. the isotopic composition of dissolved nitrates (delta n 15(no3) and delta o 18(no)) was used to constrain pollution drivers. the results indicate two main origins for human induced pollution: (i) manure and septic effluents, especially in urban areas, and (ii) synthetic fertilizers in agricultural areas. in the latter, delta n 15 enriched values highlight a mixture of those sources, possibly related to unbalanced fertilization and agricultural return flow. boron isotopes (delta b 11) were hence studied to further distinguish the nitrate origin in the presence of multiple sources and mixing processes. the results indicate that in the study area, the high geochemical background for b and cl, associated to the complex waterrock interaction processes, limit the application of the coupled delta b 11 and delta n 15 isotopic systematics to the detection of sources of groundwater pollution. in fact, despite the exceedingly high nitrate contents, the depleted delta b 11 values that characterize synthetic fertilizers and sewage leakages could not be detected. therefore, even if in saline groundwater the anthropogenic contribution has a negligible effect in terms of salinity input, with both sewage and irrigation water not very charged, the associated nitrate content fuels up water rock interaction processes, eventually leading to a mineralization increase."
Reddy et al.,2014,Water Alternatives-an Interdisciplinary Journal on Water Politics and Development,"groundwater governance: a tale of three participatory models in andhra pradesh, india","this paper explores the possible options for community based groundwater management in india. the main focus of the study is to understand the functioning and efficiency of groundwater management institutions by comparing and contrasting three participatory groundwater models in andhra pradesh. the paper assesses the operational modalities and the impact of these institutions on access, equity and sustainability of groundwater use using the qualitative and quantitative information from three sample villages representing the institutional models. social regulation approach is observed to work better for sustainable groundwater management when compared to the knowledge intensive approach, as the latter is not designed to address equity. water use and sharing through regulation has benefits like increased area under protective irrigation. in the absence of any regulations, formal or informal, and in the given policy environment, the farmers do not have any incentive to follow good practices. thus, encouraging water sharing between well owners and others would contribute to achieving the twin objectives of conservation and improved access with equity. however, community based groundwater management is neither simple nor easily forthcoming. it requires a lot of effort, working through complex rural dynamics at various levels, since appropriate policies to support or encourage such initiatives are not in place. it is argued that there is need for developing an integrated model drawing from these three models in order to make it more generic and applicable globally. such a model should integrate scientific, socioeconomic and policy aspects that suit the local conditions."
Reichwaldt et al.,2016,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,can mussels be used as sentinel organisms for characterization of pollution in urban water systems?,"urbanization strongly impacts aquatic ecosystems by decreasing water quality and altering water cycles. today, much effort is put towards the restoration and conservation of urban waterbodies to enhance ecosystem service provision, leading to liveable and sustainable cities. to enable a sustainable management of waterbodies, the quantification of the temporal and spatial variability of pollution levels and biogeochemical processes is essential. stable isotopes have widely been used to identify sources of pollution in ecosystems. for example, increased nitrogen levels in waterbodies are often accompanied with a higher nitrogen stable isotope signature (delta n 15), which can then be detected in higher trophic levels such as mussels. the main aim of this study was to assess the suitability of nitrogen stable isotopes as measured in mussels (mytilus edulis), as an indicator able to resolve spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen pollution in an urban, tidally influenced estuary (swan river estuary in western australia). nitrogen concentrations were generally low and nitrogen stable isotope values of nitrate throughout the estuary were well within natural values of uncontaminated groundwater, organic nitrate from soils, or marine derived sources, indicating groundwater inflow rather than pollution by human activity was responsible for differences between sites. the delta n 15 signature in mussels was very stable over time within each site which indicated that mussels can be used as time integrated sentinel organisms in urban systems. in addition, our study shows that the nature of the relationship between delta n 15 in the mussels and the nitrate in the water can provide insights into site specific biogeochemical transformation of nutrients. we suggest that mussels and other sentinel organisms can become a robust tool for the detection and characterization of the dynamics of a number of emerging anthropogenic pollutants of concern in urban water systems."

Richey et al.,2015,Water Resources Research,uncertainty in global groundwater storage estimates in a total groundwater stress framework,"groundwater is a finite resource under continuous external pressures. current unsustainable groundwater use threatens the resilience of aquifer systems and their ability to provide a long term water source. groundwater storage is considered to be a factor of groundwater resilience, although the extent to which resilience can be maintained has yet to be explored in depth. in this study, we assess the limit of groundwater resilience in the world's largest groundwater systems with remote sensing observations. the total groundwater stress (tgs) ratio, defined as the ratio of total storage to the groundwater depletion rate, is used to explore the timescales to depletion in the world's largest aquifer systems and associated groundwater buffer capacity. we find that the current state of knowledge of large scale groundwater storage has uncertainty ranges across orders of magnitude that severely limit the characterization of resilience in the study aquifers. additionally, we show that groundwater availability, traditionally defined as recharge and redefined in this study as total storage, can alter the systems that are considered to be stressed versus unstressed. we find that remote sensing observations from nasa's gravity recovery and climate experiment can assist in providing such information at the scale of a whole aquifer. for example, we demonstrate that a groundwater depletion rate in the northwest sahara aquifer system of 2.690.8 km(3)/yr would result in the aquifer being depleted to 90% of its total storage in as few as 50 years given an initial storage estimate of 70 km(3)."
Richey et al.,2015,Water Resources Research,quantifying renewable groundwater stress with grace,"groundwater is an increasingly important water supply source globally. understanding the amount of groundwater used versus the volume available is crucial to evaluate future water availability. we present a groundwater stress assessment to quantify the relationship between groundwater use and availability in the world's 37 largest aquifer systems. we quantify stress according to a ratio of groundwater use to availability, which we call the renewable groundwater stress ratio. the impact of quantifying groundwater use based on nationally reported groundwater withdrawal statistics is compared to a novel approach to quantify use based on remote sensing observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace) satellite mission. four characteristic stress regimes are defined: overstressed, variable stress, human dominated stress, and unstressed. the regimes are a function of the sign of use (positive or negative) and the sign of groundwater availability, defined as mean annual recharge. the ability to mitigate and adapt to stressed conditions, where use exceeds sustainable water availability, is a function of economic capacity and landuse patterns. therefore, we qualitatively explore the relationship between stress and anthropogenic biomes. we find that estimates of groundwater stress based on withdrawal statistics are unable to capture the range of characteristic stress regimes, especially in regions dominated by sparsely populated biome types with limited cropland. grace based estimates of use and stress can holistically quantify the impact of groundwater use on stress, resulting in both greater magnitudes of stress and more variability of stress between regions."

Riegels et al.,2013,Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management,systems analysis approach to the design of efficient water pricing policies under the eu water framework directive,"economic theory suggests that water pricing can contribute to efficient management of water scarcity. the european union (eu) water framework directive (wfd) is a major legislative effort to introduce the use of economic instruments to encourage efficient water use and achieve environmental management objectives. however, the design and implementation of economic instruments for water management, including water pricing, has emerged as a challenging aspect of wfd implementation. this study demonstrates the use of a systems analysis approach to designing and comparing two economic approaches to efficient management of groundwater and surfacewater given eu wfd ecological flow requirements. under the first approach, all wholesale water users in a river basin face the same volumetric price for water. this water price does not vary in space or in time, and surfacewater and groundwater are priced at the same rate. under the second approach, surfacewater is priced using a volumetric price, while groundwater use is controlled through adjustments to the price of energy, which is assumed to control the cost of groundwater pumping. for both pricing policies, optimization is used to identify optimal prices, with the objective of maximizing welfare while reducing human water use in order to meet constraints associated with eu wfd ecological and groundwater sustainability objectives. the systems analysis approach demonstrates the successful integration of economic, hydrologic, and environmental components into an integrated framework for the design and testing of water pricing policies. in comparison to the first pricing policy, the second pricing policy, in which the energy price is used as a surrogate for a groundwater price, shifts a portion of costs imposed by higher water prices from low value crops to high value crops and from small urban/domestic locations to larger locations. because growers of low value crops will suffer the most from water price increases, the use of energy costs to control groundwater use offers the advantage of reducing this burden.

Riel et al.,2018,Water Resources Research,quantifying ground deformation in the los angeles and santa ana coastal basins due to groundwater withdrawal,"we investigate complex surface deformation within the los angeles and santa ana coastal basins due to groundwater withdrawal and subsequent aquifer compaction/expansion. we analyze an 18 year interferometric synthetic aperture radar (insar) time series of 881 interferograms in conjunction with global positioning system (gps) data within the groundwater basins. the large data set required the development of a distributed time series analysis framework able to automatically decompose both the insar and gps time series into short term and long term signals. we find that short term, seasonal oscillations of ground elevations due to annual groundwater withdrawal and recharge are unsteady due to changes in seasonal withdrawal by major water districts. the spatial pattern of seasonal ground deformation near the center of the basin corresponds to a diffusion process with peak deformation occurring at locations with highest groundwater production. long term signals occur over broader areas and are ultimately caused by long term changes in groundwater production. comparison of the geodetic data with hydraulic head data from major water districts suggests that different regions of the groundwater system are responsible for different temporal components in the observed ground deformation. short term, seasonal ground deformation is caused by compaction of shallower aquifers used for the majority of groundwater production whereas long term ground deformation is correlated with delayed compaction of deeper aquifers and potential compressible clay layers. these results demonstrate the potential for geodetic analysis to be an important tool for groundwater management to maintain sustainable pumping practices."
Riemann et al.,2012,Water Sa,a proposed groundwater management framework for municipalities in south africa,"groundwater is not being perceived as an important water resource and therefore has been given limited attention in south africa. this is reflected in general statistics showing that only 13% of the nation's total water supply originates from groundwater. in contrast, most towns in arid areas depend on groundwater either as a sole supply or as an essential supply for drought management. the perception remains that groundwater is not a sustainable resource for bulk domestic supply and cannot be managed properly. despite this, a growing number of municipalities utilise groundwater on a regular basis, and provide examples of successful management of this resource. various guidelines for groundwater management in south africa have been developed. these are valuable sources of information in terms of requirements and steps to protect and manage aquifers. however, an overarching groundwater management framework was still lacking. hence, the water research commission (wrc) has commissioned a project to develop a groundwater management framework that incorporates all aspects of groundwater management at municipal level. the proposed groundwater management framework aims to improve on the management of groundwater resources by equipping the responsible authorities with the required tools and capacity. this goes beyond data collection and monitoring, and requires human and capital resources. the framework includes a detailed description of the different functions and the relevant responsibilities, the required skills, the optimal position within the municipal structure and required communication lines. hence, the assigned responsibilities and available tools to achieve sustainable groundwater management reflect the local level of water institutions, i.e. water services authority (wsa), water services provider (wsp) and water user associations (wuas). however, the principles of the framework can be applied at all levels and all scales. it is recommended that this framework be rolled out and promoted at the local government level, in combination with requisite skills development at operational level, and training of municipal officials, as well as providing incentives for successful implementation and integration of groundwater management in municipal planning."

Robertson et al.,2019,Journal of Hydrology,aridland spring response to mesoscale precipitation: implications for groundwater dependent ecosystem sustainability,"aridland springs maintain groundwater dependent habitats for aquatic and terrestrial species. san solomon spring (texas, usa) is part of a regional karst spring complex in the chihuahuan desert that supports several species of federal and state conservation interest. however, drought, climatic variability, and groundwater abstraction threaten discharge and water quality. in the surrounding delaware basin, expansion in unconventional oil and gas development using hydraulic fracturing may increase demands on aquifers that also provide flows to the springs. a critical knowledge gap limiting habitat conservation and sustainable groundwater abstraction is that the flow system is not well understood. while the source of most spring discharge is from a pleistocene recharged regional flow system, evidence suggests that a modern local flow component provides fresh water influx. however, the exact sources, mechanisms, and timing of localized recharge are unknown. to address these questions, this study combined long term in situ spring water quality monitoring (specific conductance, turbidity, and temperature) data with weather station corrected 4 km gridded precipitation data to quantify the lag response at san solomon springs to mesoscale storm events and to delineate potential local recharge zones. between april 2011 and march 2012, 26 event flow responses were documented, with an average lag of 43 days between storm event and spring response. response time varied depending on storm magnitude, spatial extent, and antecedent soil moisture conditions. cross correlation analysis of spatially distributed precipitation indicated zones of potential local recharge in the mountain block/mountain front zones and alluvial channels issuing from the davis mountains. some local flow paths appear to cross known watershed boundaries, suggesting that groundwater abstraction in sensitive capture zones should be managed carefully to maintain spring flows and conserve habitats."
Robertson et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,estimates of net infiltration in arid basins and potential impacts on recharge and solute flux due to landuse and vegetation change,"human impacts on landuse and vegetation in arid basins have, in some regions, altered infiltration, recharge, and groundwater chemistry. however, some modeling approaches currently used do not account for these effects. in the trans pecos region of texas the presence of modern water, increasing groundwater no3  concentrations, and vadose zone cores flushed of naturally accumulated solutes belie the notion that basin groundwater is unaffected by overlying landuse and vegetation change. recharge to the trans pecos basins is spatially and temporally variable, and due to human impacts it has likely changed since pre western settlement time (circa 1850s). by using the infil 3.0.1 model, a spatially distributed model of net infiltration, the volume and spatial distribution of net infiltration was examined for two basins, wild horse/michigan flats and lobo/ryan flats, with model simulations designed to examine the effects of irrigated agriculture and human impacts on vegetation. model results indicate that recharge to the basins is not limited to mountain front zones and discrete features (i.e., alluvial channels), rather, irrigation return flow contributes an estimated 6.3 x 10(7) m(3) (408 mm) of net infiltration over 40 yrs and net infiltration on the basin floors could contribute between 7% and 11.5% of annual basin recharge. model results also indicate that net infiltration may be higher under current vegetation regimes than in pre western settlement conditions; the removal of thick dense grasslands in infil model simulations enhanced net infiltration by 48% or more. results from distributed models (like infil) improve upon scientific understanding of the links between vegetation regime and hydrological processes; this is important for the sustainable management of arid basin aquifers in texas and elsewhere.

Rodiger et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,"multi response calibration of a conceptual hydrological model in the semiarid catchment of wadi al arab, jordan","a key factor for sustainable management of groundwater systems is the accurate estimation of groundwater recharge. hydrological models are common tools for such estimations and widely used. as such models need to be calibrated against measured values, the absence of adequate data can be problematic. we present a nested multi response calibration approach for a semi distributed hydrological model in the semi arid catchment of wadi al arab in jordan, with sparsely available runoff data. the basic idea of the calibration approach is to use diverse observations in a nested strategy, in which sub parts of the model are calibrated to various observation data types in a consecutive manner. first, the available different data sources have to be screened for information content of processes, e.g. if data sources contain information on mean values, spatial or temporal variability etc. for the entire catchment or only subcatchments. in a second step, the information content has to be mapped to relevant model components, which represent these processes. then the data source is used to calibrate the respective subset of model parameters, while the remaining model parameters remain unchanged. this mapping is repeated for other available data sources. in that study the gauged spring discharge (gsd) method, flash flood observations and data from the chloride mass balance (cmb) are used to derive plausible parameter ranges for the conceptual hydrological model j2000g. the watertable fluctuation (wtf) method is used to validate the model. results from modelling using a priori parameter values from literature as a benchmark are compared. the estimated recharge rates of the calibrated model deviate less than 10% from the estimates derived from wtf method. larger differences are visible in the years with high uncertainties in rainfall input data. the performance of the calibrated model during validation produces better results than applying the model with only a priori parameter values. the model with a priori parameter values from literature tends to overestimate recharge rates with up to 30%, particular in the wet winter of 1991/1992. an overestimation of groundwater recharge and hence available water resources clearly endangers reliable water resource managing in water scarce region. the proposed nested multi response approach may help to better predict water resources despite data scarcity.

Ronayne et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,analysis of managed aquifer recharge for retiming streamflow in an alluvial river,"maintenance of low flows during dry periods is critical for supporting ecosystem function in many rivers. managed aquifer recharge is one method that can be used to augment low flows in rivers that are hydraulically connected to an alluvial groundwater system. in this study, we performed numerical modeling to evaluate a managed recharge operation designed to retime streamflow in the south platte river, northeastern colorado (usa). modeling involved the simulation of spatially and temporally variable groundwater surfacewater exchange, as well as streamflow routing in the river. periodic solutions that incorporate seasonality were developed for two scenarios, a natural base case scenario and an active management scenario that included groundwater pumping and managed recharge. a framework was developed to compare the scenarios by analyzing changes in head dependent inflows and outflows to/ from the aquifer, which was used to interpret the simulated impacts on streamflow. the results clearly illustrate a retiming of streamflow. groundwater pumping near the river during winter months causes a reduction in streamflow during those months. delivery of the pumped water to recharge ponds, located further from the river, has the intended effect of augmenting streamflow during low flow summer months. higher streamflow is not limited to the target time period, however, which highlights an inefficiency of flow augmentation projects that rely on water retention in the subsurface.

Rushton et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,sustainable yields from large diameter wells in shallow weathered aquifers,"large diameter wells in shallow weathered aquifers provide a valuable source of water for domestic and agricultural purposes in many locations including the indian subcontinent. however, when used for irrigation, these wells often fail towards the end of the dry season. by considering two case studies in the dry and intermediate rainfall zones of sri lanka, reasons for the limited yield of these wells are identified. the first case study is concerned with a sloping catchment; a significant proportion of the precipitation during the rainy season either becomes runoff or passes down gradient through the aquifer and is discharged at the ground surface. furthermore, during the dry season, groundwater discharge continues. in the second case study the topography is generally flat but, even though the aquifer fills most years during the rainy season, there is often only sufficient water to irrigate about half of each farmer's holding. these investigations are based on field information and the development of conceptual and computational models. of critical importance in assessing the long term yield of a well is the formation of a seepage face on the side of the well, with the watertable a significant distance above the pumping water level. consequently the watertable may only be lowered to about half the depth of the well. the paper concludes with recommendations for the exploitation of groundwater from shallow weathered aquifers to minimise the risk of failure during the dry season.

Safavi et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,expert knowledge based modeling for integrated water resources planning and management in the zayandehrud river basin,"this study highlights the need for water resource planning and management using expert knowledge to model known extreme hydrologic variability in complex hydrologic systems with lack of data. the zayandehrud river basin in iran is used as an example of complex water system; this study provides a comprehensive description of the basin, including its water demands (municipal, agricultural, industrial and environmental) and water supply resources (rivers, inter basin water transfer and aquifers). the objective of this study is to evaluate near future conditions of the basin (from oct./2015 to sep./2019) considering the current water management policies and climate change conditions, referred as baseline scenario. a planning model for the zayandehrud basin was built to evaluate the baseline scenario, the period of hydrologic analysis is 21 years, (from oct./1991 to sep./2011); it was calibrated for 17 years and validated for 4 years using a historic scenario that considered historic water supply, infrastructure and hydrologic conditions. because the zayandehrud model is a planning model and not a hydrologic model (rainfall runoff model), an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (anfis) is used to generate synthetic natural flows considering temperature and precipitation as inputs. this model is an expert knowledge and data based model which has the benefits of artificial neural networks (ann) and fuzzy inference systems (fis). outputs of the anfis model were compared to the historic scenario results and are used in the baseline scenario. three metrics are used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the anfis model. water supply results of the baseline scenario are analyzed using five performance criteria: time based and volumetric reliability, resilience, vulnerability and maximum deficit. one index, the water resources sustainability index is used to summarize the performance criteria results and to facilitate comparison among trade offs. results for the baseline scenario show that water demands will be supplied at the cost of depletion of surface and groundwater resource, making this scenario undesirable, unsustainable and with the potential of irreversible negative impact in water sources. hence, the current water management policy is not viable; there is a need for additional water management policies that reduce water demand through improving irrigation efficiency and reduction of groundwater extraction for sustainable water resources management in the zayandehrud basin.

Safeeq et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,hydrologic effect of groundwater development in a small mountainous tropical watershed,"distributed hydrology soil vegetation model (dhsvm) was successfully applied in makaha watershed to investigate the hydrologic impact of groundwater pumping on the streamflow. dhsvm was calibrated (1971 1980) and validated (1981 1990) against observed streamflow during pre development conditions. monthly observed and simulated streamflows after the development (after 1990) were compared to quantify the decline in streamflow. simulation results indicate that declines in streamflow could be attributed to: (i) an increase in the fraction of gross rainfall converted into evapotranspiration (et); and (ii) groundwater pumping. groundwater pumping from additional groundwater development in the form of new pumping wells starting in 1991 has significantly reduced the streamflow, especially during the summer. the fraction of gross rainfall converted into et has significantly increased by 7% during 1991 2009 compared to the pre development period. based on the model results, in the absence of the groundwater development in the upper part of makaha watershed, the observed cumulative streamflow could have been 11% higher than its current level. on an annual basis, total additional groundwater pumping accounts for 26% of the recharge with a significant seasonal variability (12% in wet and 180% in dry season). relative to recharge, higher groundwater pumping during the dry season could have been the reason behind the significant streamflow decline during the summer. this study clearly emphasizes the importance of temporal patterns in groundwater withdrawal which are often ignored while determining safe yield.

Saha et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,"temporal dynamics of groundwater surfacewater interaction under the effects of climate change: a case study in the kiskatinaw river watershed, canada","groundwater surfacewater (gw sw) interaction plays a vital role in the functioning of riparian ecosystem, as well as sustainable water resources management. in this study, temporal dynamics of gw sw interaction were investigated under climate change. a case study was chosen for a study area along the kiskatinaw river in mainstem sub watershed of the kiskatinaw river watershed, british columbia, canada. a physically based and distributed gw sw interaction model, gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis (gssha), was used. two different greenhouse gas (ghg) emission scenarios (i.e., a2: heterogeneous world with self reliance and preservation of local identities, and b1: more integrated and environmental friendly world) of sres (special report on emissions scenarios) from fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) were used for climate change study for 2020 2040. the simulation results showed that climate change influences significantly the temporal patterns of gw sw interaction by generating variable temporal mean groundwater contributions to streamflow. due to precipitation variability, these contributions varied monthly, seasonally, and annually. the mean annual groundwater contribution to streamflow during 2020 2040 under the a2 and b1 scenarios is expected to be 74.5% (sigma = 2%) and 75.6% (sigma = 3%), respectively. as compared to that during the base modeling period (2007 2011), the mean annual groundwater contribution to streamflow during 2020 2040 under the a2 and b1 scenarios is expected to decrease by 5.5% and 4.4%, respectively, due to the increased precipitation (on average 6.7% in the a2 and 4.8% in the b1 scenarios) and temperature (on average 0.83 degrees c in the a2 and 0.64 degrees c in the b1 scenarios). the results obtained from this study will provide useful information in the long term seasonal and annual water extractions from the river for future water supply, as well as for evaluating the ecological conditions of the stream, which will be beneficial to aquatic ecosystems.

Sahoo et al.,2017,Hydrogeology Journal,"numerical groundwater flow modeling to evaluate potential effects of pumping and recharge: implications for sustainable groundwater management in the mahanadi delta region, india","process based groundwater models are useful to understand complex aquifer systems and make predictions about their response to hydrological changes. a conceptual model for evaluating responses to environmental changes is presented, considering the hydrogeologic framework, flow processes, aquifer hydraulic properties, boundarycondition, and sources and sinks of the groundwater system. based on this conceptual model, a quasi three dimensional transient groundwater flow model was designed using modflow to simulate the groundwater system of mahanadi river delta, eastern india. the model was constructed in the context of an upper unconfined aquifer and lower confined aquifer, separated by an aquitard. hydraulic heads of 13 shallow wells and 11 deep wells were used to calibrate transient groundwater conditions during 1997 2006, followed by validation (2007 2011). the aquifer and aquitard hydraulic properties were obtained by pumping tests and were calibrated along with the rainfall recharge. the statistical and graphical performance indicators suggested a reasonably good simulation of groundwater flow over the study area. sensitivityanalysis revealed that groundwater level is most sensitive to the hydraulic conductivities of both the aquifers, followed by vertical hydraulic conductivity of the confining layer. the calibrated model was then employed to explore groundwater flow dynamics in response to changes in pumping and recharge conditions. the simulation results indicate that pumping has a substantial effect on the confined aquifer flow regime as compared to the unconfined aquifer. the results and insights from this study have important implications for other regional groundwater modeling studies, especially in multi layered aquifer systems."
Sahoo et al.,2015,Environmental Earth Sciences,evaluation of gis based multicriteria decision analysis and probabilistic modeling for exploring groundwater prospects,"quantification of groundwater resources is indispensable for developing an efficient strategy for sustainable groundwater management. integration of remote sensing (rs) and geographical information system (gis) techniques with multicriteria decision analysis (mcda) has emerged as a powerful tool for the economical and rapid assessment of groundwater resources at a macroscale. the main intent of this study is to evaluate the performance of two gis based approaches, namely mcda as approach i and probabilistic modeling as approach ii for groundwater prospecting. in approach i, the thematic layers and their features relevant to groundwater prospect were extracted using rs and gis, and appropriate weightages were assigned to individual layers and their features based on the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) scale. after the normalization of these weights, the selected thematic layers were integrated in the gis environment to generate a groundwater prospect map. in approach ii, two probabilistic models, viz. frequency ratio (fr) and weight of evidence (woe), were used. the fr and woe probability values were calculated for each of the selected themes and then groundwater prospect maps were generated by overlaying the themes in gis. the groundwater prospect maps thus obtained by the two approaches were classified into four distinct groundwater potential zones. these maps were verified using the available well yield data. the verification results indicated that out of the ahp, fr and woe techniques, the ahp technique is superior (prediction accuracy of 77 %) to the probabilistic models (fr and woe), though the woe model also performed reasonably well with a prediction accuracy of 73 %. it is concluded that for more reliable results, the ahp technique can be used for assessing groundwater potential in a given area/region. the findings of this study are useful for the cost effective identification of suitable well locations as well as for the efficient planning and development of groundwater resources."

Salem et al.,2017,Water Resources Management,optimum abstraction of groundwater for sustaining groundwater level and reducing irrigation cost,"adaptation to increasing irrigation cost due to declination of groundwater level is a major challenge in groundwater dependent irrigated region. the objective of this study is to estimate the optimum abstraction of groundwater for irrigation for sustainable management of groundwater resources in northwest bangladesh. a data driven model using a support vector machine (svm) has been developed to estimate the optimum abstraction of groundwater for irrigation and a multiple linear regression(mlr) based model has been developed to estimate the reduction of the irrigation cost due to the elevation of the groundwater level. the application of the svm model revealed that the groundwater level in the area can be kept within the suction lift of a shallow tube well by reducing pre monsoon groundwater dependent irrigated agriculture by 40%. adaptive measures, such as reducing the overuse of water for irrigation and rescheduling harvesting, can keep the minimum level of groundwater within the reach of shallow tube wells by reducing only 10% of groundwater based irrigated agriculture. the elevation of the groundwater level through those adaptive measures can reduce the irrigation cost by 2.07 x 103 bangladesh taka (bdt) per hectare in northwest bangladesh, where the crop production cost is increasing due to the decline of the groundwater level. it is expected that the study would help in policy planning for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the region."

Sanchez et al.,2017,Applied Geochemistry,determining sources of nitrate in the semi arid rio grande using nitrogen and oxygen isotopes,"the rio grande, a semi arid river in the american southwest, is a major source of surfacewater for agriculture and municipal purposes in new mexico and western texas. in addition to increasing salinity, considerable increases in nitrate (no3 ) concentrations have been observed in the semi arid portion of the rio grande. it is possible that elevated water salinity inhibits denitrification on irrigated fields and, thus fails to mediate the excess nutrient load from anthropogenic activities. therefore, the two major goals of this study were to i) characterize and quantify major no3  sources, and ii) assess whether elevated water salinity affects microbial denitrification in the watershed. in fall 2014 and summer 2015, the rio grande surfacewater, irrigation drains, precipitation (urban runoff), and municipal waste effluents were sampled between elephant butte, new mexico and tornillo, texas (similar to 260 km distance) for chemical and stable isotope analyses. the highest no3  concentrations, up to similar to 70 140 mg/l, were observed in waste effluents and agricultural drains irrigated with the reclaimed city water. conversely, no3  concentrations in the river and agricultural drains were significantly lower (<1 10 mg/l) in the areas farther away from urban centers. two major no3  sources were identified using isotope tracers: fertilizers, with low delta n 15 and high delta o 18 (average + 0.6 and + 18.3 parts per thousand, respectively), and waste water effluents from cities, with high delta n 15 and low delta o 18 (average + 10.5 and  5.1 parts per thousand, respectively). according to nitrogen isotope mass balance constraint, the contribution of waste effluent derived no3  was the smallest in upstream locations, between elephant butte and las cruces, and accounted for up to 0 25% (+/  10%) compared to the fertilizer derived no3 . further downstream near big urban centers, the effluent contributions increased and accounted for up to 70 100% between las cruces and el paso. the highest effluent derived no3  contributions of 90 100% were measured in the agricultural district located below el paso where the reclaimed city water is commonly used for irrigation. elevated salinity does not appear to limit microbial denitrification. locally, the strongest isotopic evidence of microbial denitrification was observed in a couple of water samples showing elevated salinity (ec 2.9 4.2 ms/cm). the results of this study suggest that urban centers are important no3  contributors into the aquatic system of the semi arid rio grande watershed, and that microbial processes (e.g., denitrification) do not appear to significantly reduce no3  loads from anthropogenic sources.

Sarma et al.,2017,Hydrogeology Journal,the recharge process in alluvial strip aquifers in arid namibia and implication for artificial recharge,"alluvial strip aquifers associated with ephemeral rivers are important groundwater supply sources that sustain numerous settlements and ecological systems in arid namibia. more than 70 % of the population in the nation's western and southern regions depend on alluvial aquifers associated with ephemeral rivers. under natural conditions, recharge occurs through infiltration during flood events. due to the characteristic spatial and temporal variability of rainfall in arid regions, recharge is irregular making the aquifers challenging to manage sustainably and they are often overexploited. this condition is likely to become more acute with increasing water demand and climate change, and artificial recharge has been projected as the apparent means of increasing reliability of supply. the article explores, through a case study and numerical simulation, the processes controlling infiltration, significance of surfacewater and groundwater losses, and possible artificial recharge options. it is concluded that recharge processes in arid alluvial aquifers differ significantly from those processes in subhumid systems and viability of artificial recharge requires assessment through an understanding of the natural recharge process and losses from the aquifer. it is also established that in arid region catchments, infiltration through the streambed occurs at rates dependent on factors such as antecedent conditions, flow rate, flow duration, channel morphology, and sediment texture and composition. the study provides an important reference for sustainable management of alluvial aquifer systems in similar regions."

Sayit et al.,2012,Hydrogeology Journal,"assessment of artificial aquifer recharge potential in the kucuk menderes river basin, turkey","the kucuk menderes river basin in western turkey has been facing continuous groundwater level decline for decades. previous studies have suggested that, to avoid aquifer depletion in the basin, artificial recharge structures should be constructed. to assess artificial aquifer recharge potential in one of the subbasins, a two dimensional (2 d) groundwater model was set up using seep/w software. the material functions and parameters used in the model for both saturated and unsaturated conditions were taken from previous studies. the model has been calibrated under transient conditions. the excess runoff volume that could be collected in the recharge basins was estimated from flood frequency analysis. various scenarios were simulated to observe the change in groundwater level and storage with respect to different exceedance probabilities. simulation results suggest that a significant increase in groundwater storage is achieved by applying surface artificial recharge methods. in addition to the recharge basins, to reinforce the effect of artificial recharge, simulations are repeated with underground dam construction at the downstream side of the basin. although groundwater storage is increased with the addition of the dam, the increase in groundwater storage was not sufficient to warrant the construction."
Scanlon et al.,2012,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,groundwater depletion and sustainability of irrigation in the us high plains and central valley,"aquifer overexploitation could significantly impact crop production in the united states because 60% of irrigation relies on groundwater. groundwater depletion in the irrigated high plains and california central valley accounts for similar to 50% of groundwater depletion in the united states since 1900. a newly developed high plains recharge map shows that high recharge in the northern high plains results in sustainable pumpage, whereas lower recharge in the central and southern high plains has resulted in focused depletion of 330 km(3) of fossil groundwater, mostly recharged during the past 13,000 y. depletion is highly localized with about a third of depletion occurring in 4% of the high plains land area. extrapolation of the current depletion rate suggests that 35% of the southern high plains will be unable to support irrigation within the next 30 y. reducing irrigation withdrawals could extend the lifespan of the aquifer but would not result in sustainable management of this fossil groundwater. the central valley is a more dynamic, engineered system, with north/south diversions of surfacewater since the 1950s contributing to similar to 7x higher recharge. however, these diversions are regulated because of impacts on endangered species. a newly developed central valley hydrologic model shows that groundwater depletion since the 1960s, totaling 80 km(3), occurs mostly in the south (tulare basin) and primarily during droughts. increasing water storage through artificial recharge of excess surfacewater in aquifers by up to 3 km(3) shows promise for coping with droughts and improving sustainability of groundwater resources in the central valley."
Scheiber et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,recent and old groundwater in the niebla posadas regional aquifer (southern spain): implications for its management,"the niebla posadas (np) aquifer in southern spain is one of the main groundwater sources for the lower guadalquivir valley, a semiarid region supporting an important population, agriculture and industry. to contribute to the understanding of this aquifer the assessment of sustainable use of groundwater, the residence time of groundwater in the np aquifer has been estimated using h 3, c 14 and cl 36. along the flow paths, recharged groundwater mixes with nacl type waters and undergoes calcite dissolution and is further modified by cation exchange (ca na). consequently, the water loses most of its calcium and the residual delta c 13(dic) in the groundwater is isotopically enriched. further modifications take place along the flow path in deeper zones, where depleted delta c 13(dic) values are overprinted due to sc42  and iron oxide reduction, triggered by the presence of organic matter. dating with h 3, c 14 and cl 36 has allowed the differentiation of several zones: recharge zone (<0.06 ky), intermediate zone (0.06 20 ky), deep zone 1(20 30 ky), and deep zone 2 (>30 ky). an apparent link between the tectonic structure and the groundwater residence time zonation can be established. regional faults clearly separates deep zone 1 from the distinctly older age (>30 ky) deep zone 2. from the estimated residence times, two groundwater areas of different behavior can be differentiated within the aquifer.

Scherberg et al.,2014,Water Resources Management,design of managed aquifer recharge for agricultural and ecological water supply assessed through numerical modeling,"the walla walla basin, in eastern oregon and washington, usa, faces challenges in sustaining an agricultural water supply while maintaining sufficient flow in the walla walla river for endangered fish populations. minimum summer river flow of 0.71 m(3)/s is required, forcing irrigators to substitute groundwater from a declining aquifer for lost surfacewater diversion. managed aquifer recharge (mar) was initiated in 2004 attempting to restore groundwater levels and improve agricultural viability. the integrated water flow model (iwfm) was used to compute surface and shallow groundwater conditions in the basin under water management scenarios with varying water use, mar, and allowable minimum river flow. a mean increase of 1.5 m of groundwater elevation, or 1.5% of total aquifer storage, was predicted over the model area when comparing maximum mar and no mar scenarios where minimum river flow was increased from current level. when comparing these scenarios a 53% greater summer flow in springs was predicted with the use of mar. results indicate mar can supplement irrigation supply while stabilizing groundwater levels and increasing summer streamflow. potential increase in long term groundwater storage is limited by the high transmissivity of the aquifer material. increased mar caused increased groundwater discharge through springs and stream beds, benefiting aquatic habitat rather than building long term aquifer storage. judicious siting of recharge basins may be a means of increasing the effectiveness of mar in the basin."
Schilling et al.,2017,Environmental Earth Sciences,estimating groundwater age in the cambrian ordovician aquifer in iowa: implications for biofuel production and other water uses,"deep confined water from the cambrian ordovician (c o) aquifer is being increasingly used for ethanol production in iowa. in this study, we used isotopic age dating to estimate the age of groundwater in the aquifer and assess how groundwater use for all purposes, including ethanol production, may be affecting the long term sustainability of the aquifer. eight municipal wells located across the extent of the aquifer in iowa were sampled for major and minor ions, stable isotopes (delta o 18 and dd) and the radioactive isotope cl 36. multiple lines of evidence from this study suggest that groundwater in the c o aquifer is older than 10,000 years, with results from cl 36 analyses suggesting groundwater travel times in the aquifer ranging from approximately 70,000 to nearly 180,000 years old from northern to central iowa. our study suggests that pumping from the c o aquifer for all uses, including ethanol production, is extracting old groundwater from the aquifer. to mitigate long term impacts, we recommend that expansion of new ethanol production should be based on accessibility of sustainable groundwater resources, rather than siting facilities where deep groundwater reserves are needed for production."

Schuetz et al.,2016,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,nitrate sinks and sources as controls of spatio temporal water quality dynamics in an agricultural headwater catchment,"several controls are known to affect water quality of stream networks during flow recession periods, such as solute leaching processes, surfacewater groundwater interactions as well as biogeochemical in stream turnover processes. throughout the stream network, combinations of specific water and solute export rates and local in stream conditions overlay the biogeochemical signals from upstream sections. therefore, upstream sections can be considered functional units which could be distinguished and ordered regarding their relative contribution to nutrient dynamics at the catchment outlet. based on snapshot sampling of flow and nitrate concentrations along the stream in an agricultural headwater during the summer flow recession period, we determined spatial and temporal patterns of water quality for the whole stream. a data driven, in stream mixing and removal model was developed and applied for analysing the spatio temporal in stream retention processes and their effect on the spatio temporal fluxes of nitrate from subcatchments. thereby, we have been able to distinguish quantitatively between nitrate sinks, sources per stream reaches, and subcatchments, and thus we could disentangle the overlay of nitrate sink and source signals. for nitrate sources, we determined their permanent and temporal impact on stream water quality and for nitrate sinks, we found increasing nitrate removal efficiencies from upstream to downstream. our results highlight the importance of distinct nitrate source locations within the watershed for in stream concentrations and in stream removal processes, respectively. thus, our findings contribute to the development of a more dynamic perception of water quality in streams and rivers concerning ecological and sustainable water resource management."

Seaby et al.,2015,Hydrological Processes,spatial uncertainty in bias corrected climate change projections and hydrogeological impacts,"the question of which climate model bias correction methods and spatial scales for correction are optimal for both projecting future hydrological changes as well as removing initial model bias has so far received little attention. for 11 climate models (cms), or GCM/rcm   global/regional climate model pairing, this paper analyses the relationship between complexity and robustness of three distribution based scaling (dbs) bias correction methods applied to daily precipitation at various spatial scales. hydrological simulations are forced by cm inputs to assess the spatial uncertainty of groundwater head and stream discharge given the various dbs methods. a unique metric is devised, which allows for comparison of spatial variability in climate model bias and projected change in precipitation. it is found that the spatial variability in climate model bias is larger than in the climate change signals. the magnitude of spatial bias seen in precipitation inputs does not necessarily correspond to the magnitude of biases seen in hydrological outputs. variables that integrate basin responses over time and space are more sensitive to mean spatial biases and less so on extremes. hydrological simulations forced by the least parameterized dbs approach show the highest error in mean and maximum groundwater heads; however, the most highly parameterised dbs approach shows less robustness in future periods compared with the reference period it was trained in. for hydrological impacts studies, choice of bias correction method should depend on the spatial scale at which hydrological impacts variables are required and whether cm initial bias is spatially uniform or spatially varying. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd."

Seedang et al.,2013,Journal of Great Lakes Research,exploring market based environmental policy for groundwater management and ecosystem protection for the great lakes region: lessons learned,"the great lakes st. lawrence river basin water resources compact (the compact) was created to protect future water supplies and aquatic ecosystems in the great lakes. the compact requires the eight great lakes state to regulate, among other things, large withdrawals of groundwater and surfacewater so that they do not negatively affect stream flows and ecosystems within the great lakes basin. thus, the compact raises the possibility of increased restrictions on groundwater withdrawals in many locations throughout the great lakes region. however, restricting withdrawals is likely to encounter opposition from water users when such restrictions are viewed as an infringement on existing water use rights and/or as negatively impacting local economic development. such conflicts could hinder effective implementation of state and regional water policy. this paper explores the application of a market based environmental management tool called ""conservation credit offsets trading (ccot)"" that could facilitate allocation of groundwater withdrawals, and develops a framework for guiding the implementation of ccot within the context of a groundwater permitting system. using a watershed in southwestern michigan, this study demonstrates how bio physical information and input from various local stakeholders were combined to aid groundwater policy designed to achieve the objective of no net (adverse) impact on stream ecosystems. by allowing flexibility through trading of conservation credit offsets, this groundwater policy tool appears to be more politically acceptable than traditional, less flexible, regulations. the results and discussion provide useful lessons learned with relevance to other areas in the great lakes basin.

Segal et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,seasonal variation of high elevation groundwater recharge as indicator of climate response,"high elevation groundwater basins in the western united states are facing changes in the amount and timing of snowmelt due to climate change. the objective of this study is to examine seasonal variability in a high elevation aquifer (maras valley watershed near truckee, ca) by analyzing (1) tritium and helium isotopes to determine groundwater sources and age, (2) dissolved noble gases to determine recharge temperatures and excess air concentrations. recharge temperatures calculated at pressures corresponding to well head elevations are similar to mean annual air temperatures at lower elevations of the watershed, suggesting that most recharge is occurring at these elevations, after equilibrating in the vadose zone. the groundwater flow depth required to increase the water temperature from the recharge temperature to the discharge temperature was calculated for each well assuming a typical geothermal gradient. groundwater samples contain large amounts of excess helium from terrigenic sources, including mantle helium and radiogenic helium. terrigenic helium and tritium concentrations are used to determine the amount of mixing between the younger and older groundwater sources. many of the wells sampled show a mix of groundwater ages ranging from >1000s of years old to groundwater with tritium concentrations that are in agreement with tritium in modern day precipitation. higher seasonal variability found in wells with younger groundwater and shallower flow depths indicates that the recent recharge most vulnerable to climate impacts helps to supplement the older, less sustainable waters in the aquifer during periods of increased production.

Seibertz et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,development of in aquifer heat testing for high resolution subsurface thermal storage capability characterisation,"the ongoing transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy source provision has resulted in increased geothermal uses as well as storage of the shallow subsurface. existing approaches for exploration of shallow subsurface geothermal energy storage often lack the ability to provide information concerning the spatial variability of thermal storage parameters. however, parameter distributions have to be known to ensure that sustainable geothermal use of the shallow subsurface can take place especially when it is subject to intensive usage. in this paper, we test a temperature decay time approach to obtain in situ, direct, qualitative, spatial high resolution information about the distribution of thermal storage capabilities of the shallow subsurface. to achieve this, temperature data from a high resolution fibre optic distributed temperature sensing device, as well as data from conventional pt 100 temperature sensors were collected during a heat injection test. the latter test was used to measure the decay time of temperature signal dissipation of the subsurface. signal generation was provided by in aquifer heating with a temperature self regulating electric heating cable. heating was carried out for 4.5 days. after this, a cooling period of 1.5 weeks was observed. temperature dissipation data was also compared to direct push derived high resolution (hydro )geological data. the results show that besides hydraulic properties also the bedding and compaction state of the sediment have an impact on the thermal storage capability of the saturated subsurface. the temperature decay time approach is therefore a reliable method for obtaining information regarding the qualitative heat storage capability of heterogeneous aquifers for the use with closed loop system geothermal storage systems. furthermore, this approach is advantageous over other commonly used methods, e.g. soil sampling and laboratory analysis, as even small changes in (hydro )geological properties lead to strong variances in observed heat storage capabilities at the investigated case study site. by using fibre optic thermometers, nearly every requested spatial resolution can be achieved and easily be adjusted to the needs of actual test sites for shallow geothermal storage exploration.

Selfa et al.,2015,Journal of Rural Studies,promoting ethanol in rural kansas: local framings and cultural politics,"in this paper, we explore how local promoters framed the development of the ethanol industry in kansas, in the midwestern u.s, by attaching it to locally salient discourses related to the environment, economic development, energy independence, and the cultural importance of agricultural production. we use a framing analysis to examine the discourse and cultural politics of the promotion of ethanol production in four regional and one state level newspaper, supplemented by data from key informant interviews conducted to understand how both the promises and the impacts of the ethanol industry are reframed at the local level. we argue that by linking ethanol production to localized economic and environmental benefits, and to national security and energy independence agendas, the discourse promoting biofuels development in the local media sidelined any discussion of climate mitigation or conservation agendas associated with biofuels production, and reframed natural resource issues to justify local claims for continued water mining for agricultural production. in particular, water use in biofuels production is naturalized as an entitlement for agriculture and ethanol producers. our research adds to the rural studies literature that examines how powerful discourses and ideologies interact to advance an agenda that may actually be counter to economic and environmental futures in rural communities.

Senent-Aparicio et al.,2015,Water,evaluating groundwater management sustainability under limited data availability in semiarid zones,"in recent years, many researchers have devoted their efforts to finding an objective measurement of sustainability by developing evaluation tools based on sustainability indices. these indexes not only reveal the current state of water resources in a given area but also contribute to the development and implementation of effective sustainable water management and decision making. the great disadvantage of these indices is that for proper application, a number of variables are necessary and they are usually not available in data scarce aquifers. this study was designed to evaluate sustainability in groundwater resource management in an aquifer in a semiarid zone, using readily available parameters and under a pressure state response framework. this methodology has been applied to an aquifer in southeast spain with satisfactory results, since the indicators that were evaluated reflect the two main problems that hinder sustainable resource management: the contamination of groundwater by intensive local farming; and the need for external inputs from other basins to alleviate water stress. therefore, the methodology used can be replicated in other areas with similar characteristics to those of the case study."

Seraphin et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,partitioning groundwater recharge between rainfall infiltration and irrigation return flow using stable isotopes: the crau aquifer,"this study reports an assessment of the waterbudget of the crau aquifer (southern france), which is poorly referenced in the literature. anthropogenically controlled by a traditional irrigation practice, this alluvial type aquifer requires a robust quantification of the groundwater mass balance in order to establish sustainable water management in the region. in view of the high isotopic contrast between exogenous irrigation waters and local precipitations, stable isotopes of water can be used as conservative tracers to deduce their contributions to the surface recharge. extensive groundwater sampling was performed to obtain delta 18o and delta 2h over the whole aquifer. based on a new piezometric contour map, combined with an updated aquifer geometry, the isotopic data were implemented in a geostatistical approach to produce a conceptual equivalent homogeneous reservoir. this makes it possible to implement a parsimonious water and isotope mass balance mixing model. the isotopic compositions of the two end members were assessed, and the quantification of groundwater flows was then used to calculate the two recharge fluxes (natural and irrigation). nearly at steady state, the set of isotopic data treated by geostatistics gave a recharge by irrigation of 4.92 +/  0.89 m(3) s( 1), i.e. 1109 +/  202 mm yr( 1), and a natural recharge of 2.19 +/  0.85 m(3) s( 1), i.e. 128 +/  50 mm yr( 1). thus, 69 +/  9% of the surface recharge is caused by irrigation return flow. this study constitutes a straightforward and independent approach to assess groundwater surface recharges including uncertainties and will help to constrain future transient groundwater models of the crau aquifer.

Seward et al.,2015,Water International,using backcasting to explore ways to improve the national water department's contribution to good groundwater governance in south africa,"backcasting defines a vision of a desirable future and then analyzes the actions required to realize that vision. this article uses backcasting to explore ways to improve the national government's contribution to good groundwater governance in south africa. using the south african department of water and sanitation as a case study, it is found that lack of strategic thinking and implementation are the main impediments to service delivery. although isolated cases of groundwater 'overuse' and pollution can be found in south africa, the main governance issues are currently competition between users for groundwater use, and inordinate delays in granting authorization for that use."
Shahid et al.,2015,Journal of the Geological Society of India,spatial assessment of groundwater overexploitation in northwestern districts of bangladesh,"groundwater demand in northwestern districts of bangladesh is increasing rapidly with the growth of population and the expansion of irrigated agriculture. development and management of groundwater resources are essential to supply the growing population with sufficient water for economic development as well as for the sustainable environment of the region. in the present study, groundwater recharge abstraction balance method has been used for the spatial assessment of groundwater development potential. the abstraction of groundwater is estimated from irrigation and domestic water demands in the study area. the net recharge calculated from groundwatertable fluctuation data, whereas the abstraction of groundwater is estimated from irrigation and domestic water demands in the study area. the study shows that out of twenty six sub districts, groundwater exploitation has reached to a critical condition in fourteen sub districts. development of surfacewater resources and water conservation are essential to reduce the stress on groundwater exploitation."
Shailaja et al.,2019,Journal of Earth System Science,"assessment of aquifer zones and its protection via second order geoelectric indices in parts of drought prone region of deccan volcanic province, maharashtra, india","assessment of aquifer protection was studied in the drought prone regions of mann ganga river basin encompassing the districts of satara, sangli and solapur, in deccan volcanic province of maharashtra, india, using electrical resistivity technique. the study was also aimed at alleviating the drinking water scarcity in these regions. a total of 118 vertical electrical sounding sites were occupied using schlumberger electrode configuration and the data analysis revealed two to five layered curve types. the modelled layer resistivity and layer thickness at every station were used to calculate the dar zarrouk parameters (i.e., longitudinal conductance s and transverse resistance t). the s values showed that 67% of the area had a poor aquifer protection, whereas 16% had moderate protective capacity and 13% had weak aquifer protective capacity rating. only 4% of the study area depicted a good protective capacity rating. this indicates that the study area has a rather poor aquifer protective capacity rating, and thereby more prone to infiltrating contaminants. the regions with good to moderate protective capacity are envisaged to be potential groundwater zones. the large variation in electrical anisotropy lambda ranging from 1 to 2.8 in the study area suggests the anisotropic disposition of the aquifers in basaltic region. the intersection points of several lineaments in the study area are probable to be the most favourable zone for groundwater recharge. this is corroborated by the lineament density of the area, wherein high lineament density reflects high probability of groundwater infiltration. moreover, the rainfall distribution suggests that the central and eastern parts of the study area receive maximum precipitation, which also coincides with the zones of high lineament density. particle size analysis was determined from 92 soil samples in the study area and correlated with the longitudinal conductance in order to identify the sub surface conditions and the aquifer vulnerability. significant positive correlation was observed between the longitudinal conductance and percentage of clay fraction in the study area. these results could be relied upon for making preliminary estimates of protection from pollution for a sustainable groundwater development and management in future."
Shailaja et al.,2016,Journal of Indian Geophysical Union,efficacy of anisotropic properties in groundwater exploration from geoelectric sounding over trap covered terrain,"electrical resistivity study assumes a special significance for mapping aquifer in hard rock area and is also widely used in delineating the lateral and vertical distribution of sub surface. 23 vertical electrical soundings (ves) with wenner electrode configuration were carried out over chikotra basin, located in the southern part of kolhapur district in the deccan volcanic province (dvp) of maharashtra to delineate the groundwater potential zones and anisotropic properties of fractures for sustainable groundwater development within the study area. the results illustrate that the secondary geophysical indices provide a constructive solution in delineating the fresh water aquifers in the trap covered area. the longitudinal conductance (s) value vary from 0.016 to 5.44 omega( 1), suggesting that the entire study area reveals good to weak aquifer protective capacity rating. the low value of the protective capacity in the northern and central part of the basin is due to the absence of significant amount of clay as an overburden impermeable material, thereby enhancing the percolation of contaminants into the aquifer. the large variation in the coefficient of anisotropy from 1 to 6.18 at the 23 ves data sites, suggests the anisotropic disposition of the aquifers in basaltic region. the fracture porosity inferred from the geophysical parameters and specific conductance of groundwater varies from 0.0001% to 0.556% in the study area, signifying different degrees of water saturation within the basaltic layers. the high porosity zones corroborate with the high anisotropy values, indicating significant reserves of exploitable groundwater. this practice of analyzing ves data provided the direct solution to resolve problems in different hard rock terrains with a severe scarcity of groundwater, which has a great social impact."
Shamsuddin et al.,2018,Applied Water Science,"assessments of seasonal groundwater recharge and discharge using environmental stable isotopes at lower muda river basin, malaysia","an accurate estimation of groundwater recharge is required to properly manage aquifers, especially for riverbank filtration method (rbf) purposes. the isotopes correlations and differences in different water bodies were studied to assess the sources of groundwater recharge and preliminary tools in understanding of the surfacewater and groundwater interactions in the lower muda river basin. the environmental isotope and hydrochemical sampling results had emphasised that the area near lower muda river basin had a connection with the river and was actively recharging the near river shallow alluvial aquifer, via rbf method. furthermore, the shallow groundwater that was close to muda river from groundwater signatures had indicated the recharge of the shallow aquifer system by muda river based on the plots along lmwl on a delta h 2 versus delta o 18. the comparisons between like delta h 2 and delta o 18 isotopes in the rainwater revealed the variations in the rainfall amount and the o 18 depleted water of those isotopes for wet season precipitation as compared to dry seasons. furthermore, the groundwater delta h 2 and delta o 18 isotopes exhibited a slight deviation from the delta h 2 and delta o 18 isotopic meteoric water line in lower muda river. therefore, in this basin, the groundwater could be a combination of river water and precipitation, which had led to the recharge of river water being more than the recharge of rainfall infiltration."
Shamsudduha et al.,2011,Hydrogeology Journal,the impact of intensive groundwater abstraction on recharge to a shallow regional aquifer system: evidence from bangladesh,"quantitative evaluations of the impact of groundwater abstraction on recharge are rare. over a period (1975 2007) during which groundwater abstraction increased dramatically in the bengal basin, changes in net groundwater recharge in bangladesh are assessed using the watertable fluctuation method. mean annual groundwater recharge is shown to be higher (300 600 mm) in northwestern and southwestern areas of bangladesh than in southeastern and northeastern regions (< 100 mm) where rainfall and potential recharge are greater. net recharge in many parts of bangladesh has increased substantially (5 15 mm/year between 1985 and 2007) in response to increased groundwater abstraction for irrigation and urban water supplies. in contrast, net recharge has slightly decreased ( 0.5 to  1 mm/year) in areas where groundwater fed irrigation is low (< 30% of total irrigation) and where abstraction has either decreased or remained unchanged over the period of 1985 2007. the spatio temporal dynamics of recharge in bangladesh illustrate the fundamental flaw in definitions of ""safe yield"" based on recharge estimated under static (non pumping) conditions and reveal the areas where (1) further groundwater abstraction may increase actual recharge to the shallow aquifer, and (2) current groundwater abstraction for irrigation and urban water supplies is unsustainable."

Sheikhipour et al.,2018,Environmental Earth Sciences,a hybrid multiple criteria decision making model for the sustainable management of aquifers,"in this study, a hybrid multiple criteria decision making (hmcdm) model was proposed for prioritizing scenarios for managing groundwater use from an aquifer. three scenarios, including the construction of subsurface dams, the use of artificial recharge and reducing groundwater use by 5% and 10% were considered to assess the most sustainable development approach. the examined mcdm models were: simple additive weighting (saw); and mtahp which is a hybridization of the modified topsis and the analytic hierarchy process models. the criteria proposed for determining the order preference of the scenarios included the sustainable development index (i u) and a modified water exploitation index as well as economic, social and environmental indices. to assess the technical and economic impacts of the management scenarios, modeling of the aquifer was simulated for a 3 year period using these scenarios. the results of the assessment indicated that the scenario of water withdrawal reduction by 10% was the best scenario determined in mtahp followed by a reduction in groundwater withdrawal by 5%, the use of artificial recharge and the construction of a subsurface dam, respectively. the difference between the results of mtahp and saw models was in their first and third ranks, in such a way artificial recharge scored the first rank in saw model and the third rank in mtahp model, also withdrawal reduction by 10% scored third rank in saw model and first rank in mtahp model. the results of these two models have demonstrated that the construction of a subsurface dam in shahrekord aquifer is not an appropriate management option. according to the results of this study, mtahp models can be applied for ranking feasible management scenarios in aquifers using the redefined sustainable development and modified groundwater exploitation indices introduced in this study."

Sheng et al.,2013,Ecosphere,impacts of groundwater pumping and climate variability on groundwater availability in the rio grande basin,"groundwater is a critical resource for sustainable economic growth in an arid and semi arid region such as the rio grande basin because it provides water for municipal, industrial, and domestic, and agricultural users. the water is also important for the health of riparian ecosystems in the rio grande basin. historic groundwater pumping has resulted in large groundwater level drawdown, water quality deterioration, depletion of surfacewater and subsidence in el paso/ciudad juarez area, which in turn will limit groundwater availability in the future. therefore, securing future groundwater availability involves a multi spectrum of efforts, including minimizing net losses from the underground reservoir, managing groundwater as an integrated part of the hydrologic cycle, developing infrastructure based on an understanding of the natural hydrologic system, using water wisely and efficiently, and allocating and monitoring water fairly for human as well as environmental and ecological needs. this paper focuses on the current status of groundwater quantity and geochemistry groundwater hydrology, key aquifers, water quantity and chemistry, impacts of groundwater pumping and climate variability on groundwater availability within the rio grande basin along river reaches between elephant butte dam and amistad dam. this paper is part of a larger effort to summarize the state of the science relative to water sustainability in the region. this information can be used to plan research and education agendas aimed at water sustainability under climate and social changes. current water uses and estimates of groundwater availability are summarized for the selected regional aquifers that underlie or are located adjacent to the rio grande. several research topics are identified and recommended in terms of gaining better understanding of groundwater availability and impacts of future groundwater pumping and climate variability on the regional aquifer systems."
Shi et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,identifying the sustainable groundwater yield in a chinese semi humid basin,"the primary goal of this work was to identify the sustainable groundwater yield which is a key reference of reasonable groundwater development, but also a complex issue in current hydrogeologic science. one major limit to identify sustainable groundwater yield is the lack of a unified evaluation criterion because there are many factors involved in hydrological systems that are difficult to quantify. to address this problem, an integrated evaluation model was constructed for a series of purposes including the maximal efficiency of water use, the integral benefit of development and utilization, the optimized environmental water demand and the minimal anthropogenic influence on groundwater system. it consists of a benefit model, a water cycling simulation model and an optimization model. the basin wide model for water cycling simulation was a basic component to simulate scenarios with different constraints, and the best water development strategy was thereafter identified using the integral benefit model of water resources development. the yinma river basin in a chinese semi humid region was selected as the case study area. results indicated the optimized groundwater yield could be sustained by intensive reservoir supply and maintain suitable ecological water demand simultaneously. the work proposed a potential groundwater utilization strategy for economically developing countries across the world. crown copyright (c) 2012 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."

Shourian et al.,2017,Water Resources Management,optimum pumping well placement and capacity design for a groundwater lowering system in urban areas with the minimum cost objective,"high level of groundwater in urban areas may cause major problems in construction and mining projects. one effective solution is to implement drainage wells to lower the watertable into the desired level through an appropriate pumping strategy. in this paper, placement and capacity of the dewatering wells are optimized by minimizing the total costs of a groundwater lowering system (gls) through a simulation optimization approach. for this purpose, modflow, the groundwater simulation software, is coupled with the firefly optimization algorithm (foa) to find the optimal solution. the proposed foa modflow model is tested in an urban area in east southern part of iran, kerman city's ancient mosque region. results show that the obtained cost effective design noticeably outperforms the consulting engineers' proposal in terms of both the number of drilled wells and the associated costs with justifiable constraints. optimal strategy satisfies the constraints by suggesting construction of two wells with totally pumping rate of 5503 m(3)/day while the watertable is dropped 1.5 m with a ground subsidence less than 80 mm in the region. additionally, an investigation on the value of various design parameters emphasizes on the sensitivity of the solutions to the permissible groundwater level and the well's maximum pumping rates among the others."
Shrestha et al.,2014,Monthly Weather Review,"a scale consistent terrestrial systems modeling platform based on cosmo, clm, and parflow","a highly modular and scale consistent terrestrial systems modeling platform (terrsysmp) is presented. the modeling platform consists of an atmospheric model (consortium for small scale modeling; cosmo), a land surface model (the ncar community land model, version 3.5; clm3.5), and a 3d variably saturated groundwater flow model (parflow). an external coupler (ocean atmosphere sea ice soil, version 3.0; oasis3) with multiple executable approaches is employed to couple the three independently developed component models, which intrinsically allows for a separation of temporal spatial modeling scales and the coupling frequencies between the component models. idealized terrsysmip simulations are presented, which focus on the interaction of key hydrologic processes, like runoff production (excess rainfall and saturation) at different hydrological modeling scales and the drawdown of the watertable through groundwater pumping, with processes in the atmospheric boundary layer. the results show a strong linkage between integrated surface groundwater dynamics, biogeophysical processes, and boundary layer evolution. the use of the mosaic approach for the hydrological component model (to resolve subgrid scale topography) impacts simulated runoff production, soil moisture redistribution, and boundary layer evolution, which demonstrates the importance of hydrological modeling scales and thus the advantages of the coupling approach used in this study. real data simulations were carried out with terrsysmp over the rur catchment in germany. the inclusion of the integrated surface groundwater flow model results in systematic patterns in the root zone soil moisture, which influence exchange flux distributions and the ensuing atmospheric boundary layer development. in a first comparison to observations, the 3d model compared to the 1d model shows slightly improved predictions of surface fluxes and a strong sensitivity to the initial soil moisture content."

Siergieiev et al.,2015,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,modelling hyporheic processes for regulated rivers under transient hydrological and hydrogeological conditions,"understanding the effects of major hydrogeological controls on hyporheic exchange and bank storage is essential for river water management, groundwater abstraction, restoration and ecosystem sustainability. analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundarycondition, varying geometry of surfacewater groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. to understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) bank storage, (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2 d hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. the numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower regulated lule river, northern sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. modelling results revealed that bank storage increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. when a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected bank storage. the presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity < 0.001 m d( 1) significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated bank storage. the bank storage return/fill time ratio was positively related to wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. discharge oscillations with short duration and small amplitude decreased bank storage and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish spawning locations. based on these results, river regulation strategies can be improved by considering the effect of certain wave event configurations on hyporheic exchange to ensure harmonious hydrogeochemical functioning of the river aquifer interfaces and related ecosystems."
Silburn et al.,2013,Crop & Pasture Science,the australian cotton industry and four decades of deep drainage research: a review,"the australian cotton industry and governments have funded research into the deep drainage component of the soil waterbalance for several decades. cotton is dominantly grown in the northern murray darling and fitzroy basins, using furrow irrigation on cracking clays. previously, it was held that furrow irrigation on cracking clays was inherently efficient and there was little deep drainage. this has been shown to be simplistic and generally incorrect. this paper reviews global and northern australian deep drainage studies in irrigation, generally at point  or paddock scale, and the consequences of deep drainage. for furrow irrigated fields in australia, key findings are as follows. (i) deep drainage varies considerably depending on soil properties and irrigation management, and is not necessarily very small'. historically, values of 100 250mm year( 1) were typical, with 3 900mm year( 1) observed, until water shortage in the 2000s and continued research and extension focussed attention on water use efficiency (wue). (ii) more recently, values of 50 100mm year( 1) have been observed, with no deep drainage in drier years; these levels are lower than global values. (iii) optimisation (flow rate, field length, cut off time) of furrow irrigation can at least halve deep drainage. (iv) cotton is grown on soils with a wide range in texture, sodicity and structure. (v) deep drainage is moderately to strongly related to total rainfall plus irrigation, as it is globally. (vi) a leaching fraction, to avoid salt build up in the soil profile, is only needed for irrigation where more saline water is used. drainage from rainfall often provides an adequate leaching fraction. (vii) near saturated conditions occur for at least 2 6m under irrigated fields, whereas profiles are dry under native vegetation in the same landscapes. (viii) deep drainage leachate is typically saline and not a source of good quality groundwater recharge. large losses of nitrate also occur in deep drainage. the consequences of deep drainage for groundwater and salinity are different where underlying groundwater can be used for pumping (fresh water, high yield; e.g. condamine alluvia) and where it cannot (saline water or low yield; e.g. border rivers alluvia). continuing improvements in wue are needed to ensure long term sustainability of irrigated cropping industries. globally there is great potential for increased production using existing water supplies, given deep drainage of 10 25% of water delivered to fields and wue of <50%. future research priorities are to further characterise water movement through the unsaturated zone and the consequences of deep drainage."
Silva et al.,2012,Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science,estuarine biodiversity as an indicator of groundwater discharge,"communities located in the interface between marine/brackish and freshwater habitats are likely to be early responders to climatic changes as they are exposed to both saline and freshwater conditions, and thus are expected to be sensitive to any change in their environmental conditions. climatic effects are predicted to reduce the availability of groundwater, altering the hydrological balance on estuarine aquifer interfaces. here, we aimed to characterise the estuarine faunal community along a gradient dependent on groundwater input, under a predicted climatic scenario of reduction in groundwater discharge into the estuary. sediment macrofauna was sampled along a salinity gradient following both the wet and dry seasons in 2009. results indicated that species abundance varied significantly with the salinity gradient created by the groundwater discharge into the estuarine habitat and with sampling time. the isopode cyarhura carinata (kroyer, 1847) and the polychaetes heteromastus filiformis (claparede, 1864) and hediste diversicolor o.f. muller, 1776 were associated with the more saline locations, while oligochaeta and spionidae were more abundant in areas of lower salinity. the polychaete alkmaria romijni horst, 1919 was the dominant species and ubiquitous throughout sampling stations. this study provides evidence for estuarine fauna to be considered as a potentially valuable indicator of variation in the input of groundwater into marine freshwater interface habitats, expected from climatic pressures on aquifer levels, condition and recharge rates. for instance, a reduction in the abundance of some polychaete species, found here to be more abundant in freshwater conditions, and increasing oligochaeta found here on higher salinities, can potentially be early warnings of a reduction in the input of groundwater into estuaries. estuarine benthic species are often the main prey for commercially important fish predators such as in our case study, making it important to monitor the aquatic habitat interfaces taking into consideration the estuarine macrobenthos and groundwater availability in the system.

Skurray et al.,2012,Hydrogeology Journal,potential approaches to the management of third party impacts from groundwater transfers,"groundwater extraction can have varied and diffuse effects. negative external effects may include costs imposed on other groundwater users and on surrounding ecosystems. environmental damages are commonly not reflected in market transactions. groundwater transfers have the potential to cause spatial redistribution, concentration, and qualitative transformation of the impacts from pumping. an economically and environmentally sound groundwater transfer scheme would ensure that marginal costs from trades do not exceed marginal benefits, accounting for all third party impacts, including those of a non monetary nature as well as delayed effects. this paper proposes a menu of possible management strategies that would help preclude unacceptable impacts by restricting transfers with certain attributes, ideally ensuring that permitted transfers are at least welfare neutral. management tools would require that transfers limit or reduce environmental impacts, and provide for the compensation of financial impacts. three management tools are described. while these tools can limit impacts from a given level of extraction, they cannot substitute for sustainable overall withdrawal limits. careful implementation of transfer limits and exchange rates, and the strategic use of management area boundaries, may enable a transfer system to restrict negative externalities mainly to monetary costs. provision for compensation of these costs could be built into the system."

Sommer et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,the impact of aquifer heterogeneity on the performance of aquifer thermal energy storage,"heterogeneity in hydraulic properties of the subsurface is not accounted for in current design calculations of aquifer thermal energy storage (ates). however, the subsurface is heterogeneous and thus affects the heat distribution around ates wells. in this paper, the influence of heterogeneity on the performance of a doublet well system is quantified using stochastic heat transport modeling. the results show that on average, thermal recovery decreases with increasing heterogeneity, expressed as the lognormal standard deviation of the hydraulic conductivity field around the doublet. furthermore, heterogeneity at the scale of a doublet ates system introduces an uncertainty in the amount of expected thermal interference between the warm and cold storage. this results in an uncertainty in thermal recovery that also increases with heterogeneity and decreases with increasing distance between ates wells. the uncertainty in thermal balance due to heterogeneity can reach values near 50 percent points in case of regional groundwater flow in excess of 200 m/yr. to account for heterogeneity whilst using homogeneous models, an attempt was made to express the effect of heterogeneity by an apparent macrodispersivity. as expected, apparent macrodispersivity increases with increasing heterogeneity. however, it also depends on well to well distance and regional groundwater velocity. again, the uncertainty in thermal recovery is reflected in a range in the apparent macrodispersivity values. considering the increasing density of ates systems, we conclude that thermal interference limits the number of ates systems that can be implemented in a specific area, and the uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity field related to heterogeneity should be accounted for when optimizing well to well distances."
Sonnenborg et al.,2017,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,analyzing the hydrological impact of afforestation and tree species in two catchments with contrasting soil properties using the spatially distributed model mike she swet,"groundwater depletion occurs at a global scale but requires regional strategies for sustainable management of freshwater resources. in denmark the groundwater quantity and quality is under pressure, and forested areas are considered to protect groundwater reservoirs. however, little is known on how afforestation or forest conversion impacts the water resource at the catchment scale. we hypothesize that the groundwater formation and streamflow is increased when water consuming conifers are replaced with the less consumptive broadleaf tree species. to test this a distributed hydrological model with an energy based description of evaporation and transpiration processes (mike she swet) was used. large scale hydrological models were established for two geologically (sandy/clayey) contrasting catchments in denmark; skjern and lejre catchments. landuse scenarios were defined with forest vegetation (conifer/broadleaf) and agricultural crops (grass, maize, wheat and barley) in different areal combinations. initially, the swet component was calibrated against plot scale field data from two forest sites to obtain vegetation parameter estimates for conifers and broadleaves. subsequently, the catchment models were run for 10 years with predefined landuse scenarios. mike she swet simulated canopy interception and throughfall for conifers and broadleaf forests satisfactorily. the catchment simulations showed that replacing current conifer forests with broadleaves, resulted in a significant increase in groundwater recharge and groundwater level, especially in the skjern catchment with predominantly sandy soils. also, doubling the forest area, as intended by national legislations, using only broadleaves did not negatively affect the groundwater generation or minimum stream discharge compared to current conditions at skjern. however, because the shallow geology in the lejre catchment are dominated by clayey glacial moraine deposits with low hydraulic conductivity, increased net precipitation in areas covered by broadleaf forests would primarily discharge as overland flow or drainage flow rather than contributing to groundwater formation.

Sophocleous et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,the evolution of groundwater management paradigms in kansas and possible new steps towards water sustainability,"the purpose of this paper is to trace the evolution of key water related laws and management practices in kansas, from the enactment of the kansas water resources appropriation act of 1945 to the present, in order to highlight the state's efforts to create a more sustainable water future and in hopes that others will benefit from kansas' experience. the 1945 act provides the basic framework of water law (prior appropriation) in kansas. progression of groundwater management in the state encompasses local groundwater management districts (gmds) and their water management programs, minimum streamflow and tmdl standards, water use reporting and water metering programs, use of modified safe yield policies in some gmds, the subbasin water resources management program, the integrated resource planning/aquifer storage and recovery project of the city of wichita, the central kansas water bank, enhanced aquifer subunits management, and various water conservation programs. while these have all contributed to the slowing down of declines in groundwater levels in the high plains aquifer and in associated ecosystems, they have not yet succeeded in halting those declines. based on the assumption that the different management approaches have to operate easily within the prevailing water rights and law framework to succeed, a number of steps are suggested here that may help further diminish or reverse the declines of the high plains aquifer. these include eliminating the ""use it or lose it"" maxim in the prior appropriation framework, broadening the definition of ""beneficial use,"" regulating domestic and other ""exempt"" wells, encouraging voluntary ""sharing the shortage"" agreements, and determining to what extent water rights may be regulated in the public interest without a compensable ""taking"". further measures include establishing artificial recharge and/or aquifer storage and recovery projects wherever feasible and determining to what extent water rights holders might be subjected to reasonable dictates without having the security of their rights altered.

Sprenger et al.,2015,Environmental Earth Sciences,hydrochemistry and stable isotopes during salinity ingress and refreshment in surface  and groundwater from the arani koratallai (a k) basin north of chennai (india),"in chennai (india) public water supply and agriculture depend on groundwater to various extents, but the valuable resource shows increasing salinity over the past decades due to seawater intrusion. this study aims at identifying major hydrogeological processes which lead to salinity ingress in the main aquifer and investigates the effect of mar structures such as check dams. regional hydrochemistry is discussed by a combination of stiff diagrams, cl/br ratios, ion exchange diagram and stable isotopes (delta o 18, delta d). the identified hydrogeochemical processes were high saline evolution due to intensive seawater evaporation for commercial salt production and typical ion displacement under refreshening and salinization conditions. stable isotopes give new insights on (1) mixing processes of different end members (2) occurrence and degree of evaporation in ground  and surfacewater and (3) isotopical characterisation of groundwater recharge of the region. the identified processes were summarized in a conceptual model of the region."
Sreekanth et al.,2011,Water Resources Research,coupled simulation optimization model for coastal aquifer management using genetic programming based ensemble surrogate models and multiple realization optimization,approximation surrogates are used to substitute the numerical simulation model within optimization algorithms in order to reduce the computational burden on the coupled simulation optimization methodology. practical utility of the surrogate based simulation optimization have been limited mainly due to the uncertainty in surrogate model simulations. we develop a surrogate based coupled simulation optimization methodology for deriving optimal extraction strategies for coastal aquifer management considering the predictive uncertainty of the surrogate model. optimization models considering two conflicting objectives are solved using a multiobjective genetic algorithm. objectives of maximizing the pumping from production wells and minimizing the barrier well pumping for hydraulic control of saltwater intrusion are considered. density dependent flow and transport simulation model femwater is used to generate input output patterns of groundwater extraction rates and resulting salinity levels. the nonparametric bootstrap method is used to generate different realizations of this data set. these realizations are used to train different surrogate models using genetic programming for predicting the salinity intrusion in coastal aquifers. the predictive uncertainty of these surrogate models is quantified and ensemble of surrogate models is used in the multiple realization optimization model to derive the optimal extraction strategies. the multiple realizations refer to the salinity predictions using different surrogate models in the ensemble. optimal solutions are obtained for different reliability levels of the surrogate models. the solutions are compared against the solutions obtained using a chance constrained optimization formulation and single surrogate based model. the ensemble based approach is found to provide reliable solutions for coastal aquifer management while retaining the advantage of surrogate models in reducing computational burden.
Sreekanth et al.,2014,Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management,design of an optimal compliance monitoring network and feedback information for adaptivemanagement of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers,"management strategies for the optimal and sustainable use of groundwater resources are developed based on prescriptive models that use mathematical tools for simulation and optimization together with field data. because of the uncertainty inherent in the groundwater systems, it is essential to verify the compliance of the implemented strategies to those prescribed by using proper monitoring techniques during and after the implementation stages of the groundwater management project. in this work, an adaptivemanagement approach for optimal management and monitoring of coastal aquifers is proposed. a simulation optimization approach is used to derive optimal pumping strategy for the management of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. then, an optimal monitoring network is designed to evaluate the compliance of the aquifer responses in the field with those predicted by the simulation optimization model. the designed network can be used to monitor the compliance in the field in terms of the salinity concentration levels, which result from the implementation of the optimal pumping strategy. uncertainty in the values of groundwater parameters and the uncertainty resulting from the deviation of the pumping strategies from the prescribed optimum values are characterized by considering different realizations of these values in the three dimensional density dependent flow and transport simulation model. a new objective for monitoring is considered in this study. the objective function consists of maximizing the coefficient of variation of the salinity concentration at the monitored locations and minimizing the correlation coefficient between the concentrations at the monitored locations. using this objective, the monitoring locations are chosen in regions where the uncertainty in the concentration values is highest, and those locations where the correlation between the concentrations of the monitored locations is lowest, so that the redundancy in monitoring data is the least. the concentration data collected at the optimal compliance monitoring locations can be used as feedback information to improve the initially developed optimal coastal aquifer management strategies. the sequential modification of the optimal pumping strategies in stages is illustrated using numerical experiments.

Stadler et al.,2012,Hydrogeology Journal,the deep cretaceous aquifer in the aleppo and steppe basins of syria: assessment of the meteoric origin and geographic source of the groundwater,"a drilling project was carried out in syria to assess the potential of the deep groundwater resources of the cretaceous aquifer, composed of cenomanian turonian limestones and dolomites. in this context, isotope (c 14, h 3, delta c 13, delta o 18, delta h 2) and hydrochemical analyses were performed on wells in and around the aleppo and steppe basins. the interpretation includes complementary results from published and unpublished literature. the results provide evidence that many new wells pump mixed groundwater from the cretaceous aquifer and the overlying paleogene aquifer. radiocarbon measurements confirmed dominating pleistocene groundwater in the cretaceous aquifer and mainly holocene groundwater in the paleogene aquifer. most groundwater in the cretaceous aquifer seems to be recharged in the western limestone ridges, stretching from jebel az zawiyah (south of idlep) via jebel samane (south of afrin and a'zaz) to the region north of aleppo, and in the northern palmyrides mountain belt. some recharge also occurs around the basalt plateau of the jebel al hass, south east of aleppo. it is concluded that the taurus mountains and the euphrates river do not recharge the cretaceous aquifer. the sources of recharge seem to be occasionally occurring intensive winter storms that approach from siberia."

Stefania et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,"modeling groundwater/surfacewater interactions in an alpine valley (the aosta plain, nw italy): the effect of groundwater abstraction on surfacewater resources","a groundwater flow model of the alpine valley aquifer in the aosta plain (nw italy) showed that well pumping can induce river streamflow depletions as a function of well location. analysis of the waterbudget showed that similar to 80% of the water pumped during 2 years by a selected well in the downstream area comes from the baseflow of the main river discharge. alluvial aquifers hosted in alpine valleys fall within a particular hydrogeological context where groundwater/surfacewater relationships change from upstream to downstream as well as seasonally. a transient groundwater model using modflow2005 and the streamflow routing (sfr2) package is here presented, aimed at investigating water exchanges between the main regional river (dora baltea river, a left hand tributary of the po river), its tributaries and the underlying shallow aquifer, which is affected by seasonal oscillations. the three dimensional distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was obtained by means of a specific coding system within the database tangram. both head and flux targets were used to perform the model calibration using pest. results showed that the fluctuations of the watertable play an important role in groundwater/surfacewater interconnections. in upstream areas, groundwater is recharged by water leaking through the riverbed and the well abstraction component of the waterbudget changes as a function of the hydraulic conditions of the aquifer. in downstream areas, groundwater is drained by the river and most of the water pumped by wells comes from the base flow component of the river discharge."
Steward et al.,2013,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"tapping unsustainable groundwater stores for agricultural production in the high plains aquifer of kansas, projections to 2110","groundwater provides a reliable tap to sustain agricultural production, yet persistent aquifer depletion threatens future sustainability. the high plains aquifer supplies 30% of the nation's irrigated groundwater, and the kansas portion supports the congressional district with the highest market value for agriculture in the nation. we project groundwater declines to assess when the study area might run out of water, and comprehensively forecast the impacts of reduced pumping on corn and cattle production. so far, 30% of the groundwater has been pumped and another 39% will be depleted over the next 50 y given existing trends. recharge supplies 15% of current pumping and would take an average of 500 1,300 y to completely refill a depleted aquifer. significant declines in the region's pumping rates will occur over the next 15 20 y given current trends, yet irrigated agricultural production might increase through 2040 because of projected increases in water use efficiencies in corn production. water use reductions of 20% today would cut agricultural production to the levels of 15 20 y ago, the time of peak agricultural production would extend to the 2070s, and production beyond 2070 would significantly exceed that projected without reduced pumping. scenarios evaluate incremental reductions of current pumping by 20 80%, the latter rate approaching natural recharge. findings substantiate that saving more water today would result in increased net production due to projected future increases in crop water use efficiencies. society has an opportunity now to make changes with tremendous implications for future sustainability and livability."
Stoewer et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,tracing freshwater nitrate sources in pre alpine groundwater catchments using environmental tracers,"groundwater is one of the main resources for drinking water. its quality is still threatened by the widespread contaminant nitrate (not). in order to manage groundwater resources in a sustainable manner, we need to find options of lowering nitrate input. particularly, a comprehensive knowledge of nitrate sources is required in areas which are important current and future drinking water reservoirs such as pre alpine aquifers covered with permanent grassland. the objective of the present study was to identify major sources of nitrate in groundwater with low mean nitrate concentrations (8 +/  2 mg/l). to achieve the objective, we used environmental tracer approaches in four pre alpine groundwater catchments. the stable isotope composition and tritium content of water were used to study the hydrogeology and transit times. furthermore, nitrate stable isotope methods were applied to trace nitrogen from its sources to groundwater. the results of the nitrate isotope analysis showed that groundwater nitrate was derived from nitrification of a variety of ammonium sources such as atmospheric deposition, mineral and organic fertilizers and soil organic matter. a direct influence of mineral fertilizer, atmospheric deposition and sewage was excluded. since temporal variation in stable isotopes of nitrate were detected only in surfacewater and locally at one groundwater monitoring well, aquifers appeared to be well mixed and influenced by a continuous nitrate input mainly from soil derived nitrogen. hydrogeological analysis supported that the investigated aquifers were less vulnerable to rapid impacts due to long average transit times, ranging from 5 to 21 years. our study revealed the importance of combining environmental tracer approaches and a comprehensive sampling campaign (local sources of nitrate, soil water, river water, and groundwater) to identify the nitrate sources in groundwater and its vulnerability. in future, the achieved results will help develop targeted strategies for a sustainable groundwater management focusing more on soil nitrogen storage.

Strack et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,vertically integrated flow in stratified aquifers,"we present a set of continuous discharge potentials that can be used to determine the vertically integrated flow in stratified aquifers. the method applies to cases where the boundaries are vertical and either the hydraulic head is given, or the boundary is a seepage face, or the integrated discharge is given. the approach is valid for cases of given recharge through the upper and/or lower boundaries of the aquifer. the method is valid for any values of hydraulic conductivity; there are no limitations of the contrast for the method to be valid. the flows in the strata may be either confined or unconfined, and locally perched conditions may exist, but the effect of capillarity is not included. the hydraulic head is determined by applying the dupuit forchheimer approximation. the main advantage of the approach is that very complex conditions in stratified aquifer systems, including locally perched conditions and extremely complex flow systems can be treated in a relatively straight forward approach by considering only the vertically integrated flow rates. the approach is particularly useful for assessing groundwater sustainability, as a model to be constructed prior to developing a fully three dimensional numerical model.

Strack et al.,2014,Water Resources Research,a new formulation for steady multiaquifer flow: an analytic element for piecewise constant infiltration,"this paper contains a new formulation for infiltration inside domains bounded by polygons and its application to problems of steady multiaquifer flow, using the dupuit forchheimer approximation and assuming vertical flow in the separating layers. an alternative formulation is presented for leaky aquifer systems where infiltration or extraction is given. existing formulations of multiaquifer flow involve a system of equations that must be solved for the heads in the aquifers. these formulations are abstract, and the relation between the parameters in the solution and physical quantities is hidden. the formulation in the paper aims at linking the system of equations to physical quantities; we have done this in two ways. first, we formulate the problem in terms of leakage potentials, related directly to the leakage through the leaky layers. second, we introduce the concept of equilibrated leakage, leakage that is either the result of infiltration or of some disturbance in the flow pattern, such as that caused by a well. the leakage through the leaky layers tends to some constant value far from a disturbance, e.g., a well, or the boundary of an area of constant infiltration. this concept of equilibrated leakage is useful in practice and helps in understanding the distribution of leakage; we explain this in detail in the paper. the study of problems of steady flow in leaky aquifer systems is inspired by problems of groundwater sustainability, where the overall distribution of flow over long periods of time is important, rather than detailed information. key points <list id=""wrcr21141 list 0001"" list type=""bulleted""> <list item id=""wrcr21141 li 0001"">new formulation for multiaquifer flow <list item id=""wrcr21141 li 0002"">an analytic element for piecewise constant infiltration <list item id=""wrcr21141 li 0003"">leakage factors for multiaquifer flow <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1002/(issn)1944 7973</doi"
Su et al.,2014,Journal of Earth Science,sustainability of intensively exploited aquifer systems in the north china plain: insights from multiple environmental tracers,"environmental tracers are proving to be a unique tool for assessing groundwater sustainability, such as characterization of recharge, identification of pathways and sources of contaminants, and prediction of groundwater change in response to excessive abstraction. this paper helps to better understand the groundwater sustainability in the quaternary aquifer from the tracer data in the north china plain. relatively modern groundwaters occur in the piedmont plain with h 3 he 3 age less than 40 a within a depth 100 m. these groundwaters are mainly recharged from the local precipitation and irrigation return. the recharge rate estimated by tracers is in the range of 0.24 to 0.32 m/a. paleowater which is dated from 10 000 a b.p. to more than 35 000 a b.p. by radiocarbon dating is found in highly confined portions of quaternary aquifer systems. this indicates that water recharge took place during the past glacial period. the tracers have suggested a slow natural replenishment rates to the central plain. the aquifer has been overexploited currently. some strategies that can be implemented to promote a sustainable groundwater supply are needed to implement in future."

Su et al.,2017,Human and Ecological Risk Assessment,"responses of groundwater vulnerability to groundwater extraction reduction in the hun river basin, northeastern china","intensive groundwater extraction causes many environmental problems globally. reducing groundwater extraction is a primary method for alleviating these problems. however, this reduction may create new pollution issues because of an increase in groundwater vulnerability. a case study was done using the draotic evaluation method (an improved drastic method for organic pollutant in aquifer vulnerability; soil (s factor) has been updated by organic matter (o factor) in the method) for the hun river basin, northeastern china, where groundwater intensive extraction had caused serious environmental and hydrogeological problems. the assessment results show that moderate vulnerability level is the main vulnerability level in the hun river basin; high vulnerability level and low vulnerability level categories occupy a smaller area; while very high and very low vulnerability categories occupy the smallest area. by combining the predicted groundwater level distribution and draotic model, the responses of groundwater vulnerability to different groundwater extraction reductions could be studied. the results show that groundwater vulnerability levels increased as groundwater extraction was reduced; this is because the rising groundwater levels make it easier for pollution coming from the surface to reach the aquifer. the more the reduction in groundwater extraction, the greater the increase in the area with higher vulnerability levels, and the greater the increase in pollution risk."
Suarez et al.,2015,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,understanding runoff processes in a semi arid environment through isotope and hydrochemical hydrograph separations,"the understanding of runoff generation mechanisms is crucial for the sustainable management of river basins such as the allocation of water resources or the prediction of floods and droughts. however, identifying the mechanisms of runoff generation has been a challenging task, even more so in arid and semi arid areas where high rainfall and streamflow variability, high evaporation rates, and deep groundwater reservoirs may increase the complexity of hydrological process dynamics. isotope and hydrochemical tracers have proven to be useful in identifying runoff components and their characteristics. moreover, although widely used in humid temperate regions, isotope hydrograph separations have not been studied in detail in arid and semiarid areas. thus the purpose of this study is to determine whether isotope hydrograph separations are suitable for the quantification and characterization of runoff components in a semi arid catchment considering the hydrological complexities of these regions. through a hydrochemical characterization of the surfacewater and groundwater sources of the catchment and two and three component hydrograph separations, runoff components of the kaap catchment in south africa were quantified using both isotope and hydrochemical tracers. no major disadvantages while using isotope tracers over hydrochemical tracers were found. hydrograph separation results showed that runoff in the kaap catchment is mainly generated by groundwater sources. two component hydrograph separations revealed groundwater contributions of between 64 and 98% of total runoff. by means of threecomponent hydrograph separations, runoff components were further separated into direct runoff, shallow and deep groundwater components. direct runoff, defined as the direct precipitation on the stream channel and overland flow, contributed up to 41% of total runoff during wet catchment conditions. shallow groundwater defined as the soil water and nearsurfacewater component (and potentially surface runoff) contributed up to 45% of total runoff, and deep groundwater contributed up to 84% of total runoff. a strong correlation for the four studied events was found between the antecedent precipitation conditions and direct runoff. these findings suggest that direct runoff is enhanced by wetter conditions in the catchment that trigger saturation excess overland flow as observed in the hydrograph separations."
Sultan et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,"modern recharge to fossil aquifers: geochemical, geophysical, and modeling constraints","the nubian sandstone (nss) aquifer of northeast africa is believed to have been recharged in previous wet climatic periods in the quaternary period. while this is largely true, we show using the sinai peninsula as our test site that the aquifer is locally receiving modern recharge under the current dry climatic conditions. the validity of the advocated model was tested using geophysical (conventional electrical resistivity [er]) and isotopic (o, h) data, and estimates for modern recharge were obtained using continuous rainfall runoff modeling over the period 1998 2007. interpretations of er profiles are consistent with the presence of unconfined nss aquifers flooring recharge areas at the foothills of the crystalline basement in sinai at baraga (thickness: 20 to >188 m; resistivity: 16 130 omega m) and zalaga (thickness: 27 to >115 m; resistivity: 3 202 omega m). the isotopic composition (delta d:  22.7 to  32.8 parts per thousand; delta o 18:  4.47 to  5.22 parts per thousand) of groundwater samples from wells tapping the nss aquifer underlying recharge areas is consistent with mixing between two endmembers: (1) fossil groundwater with isotopic compositions similar to those of the western desert nss aquifer (delta d:  72 to  81 parts per thousand; delta o 18:  10.6 to  11.9 parts per thousand), and (2) average modern meteoric precipitation (delta d:  9.84 parts per thousand; delta o 18:  3.48 parts per thousand) in sinai, with the latter endmember being the dominant component. a first order estimate for the average annual modern recharge for the nss aquifer was assessed at similar to 13.0 x 10(6) m(3)/yr using the swat (soil water assessment tool) model. findings bear on the sustainable exploitation of the nss aquifer, where the aquifer is being locally recharged, and on the exploitation of similar extensive aquifers that were largely recharged in previous wet climatic periods but are still receiving modest modem meteoric contributions.

Sun et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,predicting groundwater level changes using grace data,"the purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility of downscaling gravity recovery and climate experiment (grace) satellite data for predicting groundwater level changes and, thus, enhancing current capability for sustainable water resources management. in many parts of the world, water management decisions are traditionally informed by in situ observation networks which, unfortunately, have seen a decline in coverage in recent years. since its launch, grace has provided terrestrial water storage change (tws) data at global and regional scales. the application of grace data for local scale groundwater resources management has been limited because of uncertainties inherent in grace data and difficulties in disaggregating various tws components. in this work, artificial neural network (ann) models are developed to predict groundwater level changes directly by using a gridded grace product and other publicly available hydrometeorological data sets. as a feasibility study, ensemble ann models are used to predict monthly and seasonal water level changes for several wells located in different regions across the us. results indicate that grace data play a modest but significantly role in the performance of ann ensembles, especially when the cyclic pattern of groundwater hydrograph is disrupted by extreme climate events, such as the recent midwest droughts. the statistical downscaling approach taken here may be readily integrated into local water resources planning activities."
Sun et al.,2014,Agronomy Journal,performance of a double cropping system under a continuous minimum irrigation strategy,"conservation of groundwater resources is very important for the grain production in the north china plain (ncp). previous studies showed that under minimum irrigation strategy (mi), the popular double cropping system of wheat (triticum aestivum l.) and maize (zea mays l.) in ncp might achieve sustainable groundwater use with a moderate yield penalty. field experiments were continuously conducted from 2005 to 2012 to evaluate the long term effects of mi on the crops performance. the experiment compared the yield and crop water use under mi and full water supply conditions (full irrigation, fi). results showed that yield reduction rate (yrr) under mi for wheat increased substantially and for maize decreased slightly. the diminishing rainfall during the rapid vegetative growing stages of wheat was partly responsible for this result. soil moisture stored before sowing of wheat contributed around 61% of the seasonal crop water use under mi, and strongly affected the final grain production of this crop. the depleted soil moisture during wheat season was partly replenished during the maize season. soil drying trend in deep soil layers under mi was not observed. this result indicated that the mi strategy was sustainable. the average annual crop water use over the 7 yr was 625 and 956 mm under mi and fi. with a 18.3% yield penalty, annual crop water use was reduced by 34.6% from fi to mi. seasonal atmospheric evaporation demand affected the grain production of both crops under mi and fi."
Sun et al.,2011,Agricultural Water Management,optimization of yield and water use of different cropping systems for sustainable groundwater use in north china plain,"a groundwater crisis is going on in the north china plain (ncp), due to the excessive water consumption of the traditional winter wheat (ww)/summer maize (sm) double cropping system (two harvests in one year). in order to improve the water use efficiency in this particular cropping system and to evaluate the sustainability of water usage in chinese agroecosystems, two field experiments were conducted from october 2004 to september 2006 at two sites of the north china plain. the field experiments included four treatments: (1) farmers' practice (fp) with two harvests in one year (ww/sm rotation), (2) fp with reduced input (ri) of water and nitrogen (ww/sm rotation), (3) three harvests in two years (tw, 1st year: ww/sm; 2nd year: spring maize), and (4) continuous spring maize monoculture (cs) with one harvest per year (spring maize). in the treatments ri, tw and cs, the amount and timing of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization was optimized using tdr based soil moisture measurements and the n min method, respectively. data showed that the utilization efficiency of irrigation water can be improved by optimizing soil water management compared to the traditional water management (fp). however, the groundwater net consumption required for ri still surpassed 300 mm yr( 1). both fp and ri, still overused groundwater resources. the groundwater consumption in the continuous spring maize (cs) was on average 139 mm yr( 1). therefore, the cs system can show the potential to use groundwater sustainably in the long term. water usage of the tw treatment was in between the water usage of the other treatments. the grain yields in the double cropping systems (fp and ri) were higher than that in the two other systems (tw and cs). but the cs treatment showed the higher w ue than others.

Susnik et al.,2013,Water Resources Management,comparative analysis of system dynamics and object oriented bayesian networks modelling for water systems management,"this paper presents a comparative analysis of system dynamics modelling (sdm) and object oriented bayesian networks (oobn). both techniques are extensively used for water resources modelling due to their flexibility, effectiveness in assessing different management options, ease of operation and suitability for encouraging stakeholder involvement. conversely, both approaches have several important differences that make them complementary. for example, while sdm is more suitable for simulating the feedback dynamics of processes, oobn modelling is a powerful tool for modelling systems with uncertain inputs (or outputs) characterised by probability distributions. this comparative analysis is applied to the kairouan aquifer system, tunisia, where the aquifer plays an essential role for socio economic development in the region. both models produced comparable results using baseline data, and show their complementarity through a suite of scenario tests. it is shown that reducing pumping of groundwater to coastal cities may prove the key to reducing the current aquifer deficit, though local demand reduction must be considered to preserve the agricultural economy. it is suggested that water management assessment should be tackled using both approaches to complement each other, adding depth and insight, and giving a more coherent picture of the problem being addressed, allowing for robust policy decisions to be made."
Suursoo et al.,2017,Science of the Total Environment,temporal changes in radiological and chemical composition of cambrian vendian groundwater in conditions of intensive water consumption,"intensive groundwater uptake is a process at the intersection of the anthroposphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. in this study, groundwater uptake on a peninsula where only one aquifer system the cambrian vendian (cm v)   is available for drinking water uptake is observed for a period of four years for relevant radionuclides and chemical parameters (cl, mn, fe, delta o 18). intensive groundwater uptake from the cm v aquifer system may lead to water inflow either from the sea, through ancient buried valleys or from the under laying crystalline basement rock which is rich in natural radionuclides. changes in the geochemical conditions in the aquifer may in turn bring about desorption of ra from sediment surface. knowing the hydrogeological background of the wells helps to predict possible changes in water quality which in turn are important for sustainable groundwater management and optimization of water treatment processes. changes in cl and ra concentrations are critical parameters to monitor for sustainable management of the cm v groundwater. radionuclide activity concentrations in groundwater are often considered rather stable, minimum monitoring frequency of the total indicative dose from drinking water is set at once every ten years. the present study demonstrates that this is not sufficient for ensuring stable drinking water quality in case of aquifer systems as sensitive as the cm v aquifer system. changes in cl concentrations can be used as a tool to predict ra activity concentrations and distribute the production between different wells opening to the same aquifer system.

Swartjes et al.,2017,Water Research,a novel concept in groundwater quality management: towards function specific screening values,"this paper is meant to initiate and feed the discussion on a more sophisticated procedure for the derivation and use of groundwater screening values (gsvs). to this purpose, the possibilities and tools for the derivation of function specific gsvs, i.e., gsvs that depend on the actual contact of humans and ecosystems with groundwater and groundwater related mediums, are elaborated in this study. application of gsvs geared to the specific use and function of specific groundwater volumes could result in a more effective and cost efficient groundwater quality management, without compromising the protection of human health and the ecosystem. therefore, a procedure to derive function specific gsvs was developed. for illustrative purposes, risk limits have been derived for human health and ecological protection targets, for arsenic, benzene, methyl tert butyl ether (mtbe) and vinylchloride. agriculture and nature reserves (combined), residential and industrial landuses have been considered and two different groundwater management purposes, i.e., curative and sustainable groundwater management. for each of the four contaminants, this results in a series of risks limits for each function and landuse combination. it is shown that for all four contaminants higher groundwater screening values are considered appropriate for less sensitive combinations of function and landuse. in the process towards (policy) implementation of these function specific gsv, it is recommended to evaluate the selection of protection targets; the scientific basis of the risk assessment procedures applied and the methodology to assess the time factor for groundwater quality assessment, given the fact that groundwater is a dynamic medium. moreover, protection levels must be harmonized with national or regional groundwater quality standards and correspond with the requirements of the groundwater daughter directive of the european union water framework directive. groundwater plumes that are judged as 'no need for remediation' are not compatible with the water framework directive requirement to take actions to prevent or limit inputs of contaminants, even when no receptor is present. however, the european commission formulated a series of exemptions, to avoid that the ""prevent"" requirement would imply an onerous and sometimes unfeasible task. the function specific gsvs derived in this study could be used to identify the groundwater volumes that do not result in an unacceptable risk. 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."
Switzman et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,"conservation planning as an adaptive strategy for climate change and groundwater depletion in wadi el natrun, egypt","in drylands, groundwater is often the sole source of freshwater for industrial, domestic and agricultural uses, while concurrently supporting ecosystems. many dryland aquifers are becoming depleted due to over pumping and a lack of natural recharge, resulting in loss of storage and future water supplies, water level declines that reduce access to freshwater, water quality problems, and, in extreme cases, geologic hazards. conservation is often proposed as a strategy for managing groundwater to reduce or reverse the depletion, although there is a need to better understand its potential effectiveness and benefits at the local scale. this study assesses the impact of water conservation planning strategies on groundwater resources in the wadi el natrun (wen) area of northern egypt. wen has been subjected to groundwater depletion and quality degradation since the 1990s, attributed to agricultural and industrial groundwater usage. initiatives have been proposed to increase the sustainability of the groundwater resource in the study area, but they have yet to be evaluated. simultaneously, there are also proposals to increase the extent of arable land and thus demand for freshwater. in this study, three water management scenarios are developed and assessed to the 2060s for their impact on groundwater resources using a hydrogeologic model. results demonstrate that demand management implemented through an optimized irrigation and crop rotation strategy has the greatest potential to significantly reduce risk of groundwater depletion compared to the other two scenarios ""business as usual"" and ""30% water use reduction"" that were evaluated."

Tashie et al.,2016,Water Resources Research,identifying long term empirical relationships between storm characteristics and episodic groundwater recharge,"shallow aquifers are an important source of water resources and provide base flow to streams; yet actual rates of groundwater recharge are difficult to estimate. while climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events, the resulting impact on groundwater recharge remains poorly understood. we quantify empirical relations between precipitation characteristics and episodic groundwater recharge for a wide variety of geographic and landuse types across north carolina. we extract storm duration, magnitude, average rate, and hourly weighted intensity from long term precipitation records over periods of 12 35 years at 10 locations. using time series of watertable fluctuations from nearby monitoring wells, we estimate relative recharge to precipitation ratios (rpr) to identify statistical trends. increased rpr correlates with increased storm duration, whereas rpr decreases with increasing magnitude, average rate, and intensity of precipitation. agricultural and urban areas exhibit the greatest decrease in rpr due to increasing storm magnitude, average rate, and intensity, while naturally vegetated areas exhibit a larger increase in rpr with increased storm duration. though rpr is generally higher during the winter than the summer, this seasonal effect is magnified in the appalachian and piedmont regions. these statistical trends provide valuable insights into the likely consequences of climate and landuse change for water resources in subtropical climates. if, as predicted, growing seasons lengthen and the intensity of storms increases with a warming climate, decreased recharge in appalachia, the piedmont, and rapidly growing urban areas of the american southeast could further limit groundwater availability."

Tian et al.,2015,Water Resources Research,exploring scale dependent ecohydrological responses in a large endorheic river basin through integrated surfacewater groundwater modeling,"ecohydrological processes in a water limited environment are sensitive to both climate conditions and human activities, but the response mechanisms have rarely been explored for large endorheic river basins via an integrated modeling approach. this study established an integrated surfacewater groundwater model for the heihe river basin (hrb), china's second largest endorheic river basin, using gsflow as the modeling platform. evapotranspiration (et) and leaf area index (lai) data independently derived from remote sensing products were compared and correlated, respectively, with the modeling results. scale dependent interrelationships among ecological, hydrological, and human impact (i.e., diversion and pumping) variables were revealed through multiple regression analyses. major study findings include: (1) the independent et and lai data enabled the modeler to crosscheck the modeling results from a unique angle not possible with conventional groundwater and streamflow observations; (2) controlling factors for the temporal variability of et and lai exhibit notable scale dependence, reflecting distinctive climate, and human impacts on different land covers; and (3) there exists an intricate linkage between the hydrological regimes in the lower hrb and the middle hrb, essentially equivalent to a tradeoff between the ecosystem health of the lower hrb and the sustainable development of the middle hrb. overall, the integrated modeling assisted by the independent et and lai data has provided a coherent understanding on the regional water cycle, and led to new insights on tackling the existing water conflicts in hrb."
Timani et al.,2015,Hydrogeology Journal,multi model groundwater management optimization: reconciling disparate conceptual models,"disagreement among policymakers often involves policy issues and differences between the decision makers' implicit utility functions. significant disagreement can also exist concerning conceptual models of the physical system. disagreement on the validity of a single simulation model delays discussion on policy issues and prevents the adoption of consensus management strategies. for such a contentious situation, the proposed multi conceptual model optimization (mcmo) can help stakeholders reach a compromise strategy. mcmo computes mathematically optimal strategies that simultaneously satisfy analogous constraints and bounds in multiple numerical models that differ in boundarycondition, hydrogeologic stratigraphy, and discretization. shadow prices and trade offs guide the process of refining the first mcmo developed multi model strategy into a realistic compromise management strategy. by employing automated cycling, mcmo is practical for linear and nonlinear aquifer systems. in this reconnaissance study, mcmo application to the multilayer cache valley (utah and idaho, usa) river aquifer system employs two simulation models with analogous background conditions but different vertical discretization and boundarycondition. the objective is to maximize additional safe pumping (beyond current pumping), subject to constraints on groundwater head and seepage from the aquifer to surfacewaters. mcmo application reveals that in order to protect the local ecosystem, increased groundwater pumping can satisfy only 40 % of projected water demand increase. to explore the possibility of increasing that pumping while protecting the ecosystem, mcmo clearly identifies localities requiring additional field data. mcmo is applicable to other areas and optimization problems than used here. steps to prepare comparable sub models for mcmo use are area dependent."

Timms et al.,2012,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"implications of deep drainage through saline clay for groundwater recharge and sustainable cropping in a semi arid catchment, australia","the magnitude and timing of deep drainage and salt leaching through clay soils is a critical issue for dryland agriculture in semi arid regions (< 500 mm yr( 1) rainfall, potential evapotranspiration > 2000 mm yr( 1)) such as parts of australia's murray darling basin (mdb). in this rare study, hydrogeological measurements and estimations of the historic waterbalance of crops grown on overlying grey vertosols were combined to estimate the contribution of deep drainage below crop roots to recharge and salinization of shallow groundwater. soil sampling at two sites on the alluvial flood plain of the lower namoi catchment revealed significant peaks in chloride concentrations at 0.8 1.2 m depth under perennial vegetation and at 2.0 2.5 m depth under continuous cropping indicating deep drainage and salt leaching since conversion to cropping. total salt loads of 91 229 t ha( 1) nacl equivalent were measured for perennial vegetation and cropping, with salinity to >= 10 m depth that was not detected by shallow soil surveys. groundwater salinity varied spatially from 910 to 2430 ms m( 1) at 21 to 37 m depth (n = 5), whereas deeper groundwater was less saline (290 ms m( 1)) with use restricted to livestock and rural domestic supplies in this area. the agricultural production systems simulator (apsim) software package predicted deep drainage of 3.3 9.5 mm yr( 1) (0.7 2.1% rainfall) based on site records of grain yields, rainfall, salt leaching and soil properties. predicted deep drainage was highly episodic, dependent on rainfall and antecedent soil water content, and over a 39 yr period was restricted mainly to the record wet winter of 1998. during the study period, groundwater levels were unresponsive to major rainfall events (70 and 190 mm total), and most piezometers at about 18 m depth remained dry. in this area, at this time, recharge appears to be negligible due to low rainfall and large potential evapotranspiration, transient hydrological conditions after changes in landuse and a thick clay dominated vadose zone. this is in contrast to regional groundwater modelling that assumes annual recharge of 0.5% of rainfall. importantly, it was found that leaching from episodic deep drainage could not cause discharge of saline groundwater in the area, since the watertable was several meters below the incised river bed."
Tirupathi et al.,2019,Sustainable Cities and Society,fuzzy based approach for evaluating groundwater sustainability of asian cities,"the objective of this research is to develop a fuzzy based groundwater sustainability index (fgsi) model to evaluate the sustainability of groundwater system at selected cities in asian. the new mamdani type fuzzy based inference system known as fgsi was developed. it contains five components and twenty four indicators, which covers five dimensions of sustainability, namely, environmental, social, economic, mutual trust, and institutional. the fgsi model offers a novel combination of indicators, which covers aspects of groundwtaer quality, quantity, and management. an attempt was made to develop a robust index for estimating the groundwater sustainability. the model was evaluated for selected cities in asian with different difuzzification methods, and compared with the conventional method. the centroid defuzzification method produced well diversified results compared with other methods, including conventional method. the overall groundwater sustainability of hyderabad of india was estimated as highly sustainable and, lahore of pakistan, bangkok of thailand, ho chi minh city of vietnam and yangon city of myanmar were estimated as moderately sustainable. the fgsi model may help to policy and decision makers to provide a reliable and resilient sustainable management system in the cities by identifying the indicators for the improvement."
Tizro et al.,2011,Irrigation and Drainage,simulation of a groundwater artificial recharge in a semi arid region of iran,"the bahar aquifer is one of the most economically important aquifers in the western part of iran, covering the water demands for irrigation supplies. intensive pumping for irrigation has caused a watertable decline. the local water organisation has constructed a water storage structure to augment the groundwater resources. groundwater recharge using water from the river via 13 dug wells and a related structure has been estimated as 2.7 million m(3), for the hydrological year 2002 2003. a three dimensional model was developed to predict the aquifer system response. the effect of radial flow was found to be 4 km, and the area covering this recharge more than 40 km(2). the results of the numerical model could be used by local authorities and decision makers for groundwater resources management and planning. finally, it is concluded that aquifer recharge is one environmental solution, as a part of integral water resources management. copyright (c) 2010 john wiley & sons, ltd."

Tremblay et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,teleconnections and interannual variability in canadian groundwater levels,"relatively little is known about the impact of climate change on groundwater. the analysis of large scale climatic patterns such as the well known el nino southern oscillation index could provide a better comprehension of the causes of recharge variations in aquifers and therefore improve the knowledge related to processes behind the variability of groundwater level time series. this topic has been studied to a limited extent in other parts of the world, but no study has yet used this approach across canada. in this work, correlation and wavelet analyses and wavelet coherence are used to gain a broader understanding of the interannual dynamics of recharge through the use of groundwater level records in three canadian regions, namely prince edward island (pei), southern manitoba in the vicinity of winnipeg (mb) and vancouver island (vi). cause and effect linkages between four climatic indices (the north atlantic oscillation (nao), the arctic oscillation (ao), the pacific north american pattern (pna) and the el nino southern oscillation represented by the multivariate enso index (mei)), groundwater level time series, as well as precipitation and temperature time series are investigated. the length of the available historical records of groundwater levels at the three sites is 32 years (1974 2005). the three canadian regions studied show drastically different patterns of variability evolution for the hydrogeological records. groundwater level variability on pei is mostly influenced by the nao and the ao. the variability of groundwater levels in the mb region is partly explained by pna. in the vi region, nao, ao and mei appear to impact the pattern of groundwater variability. crown copyright (c) 2011 published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."
Trigg et al.,2014,Journal of Hydrology,groundwater fluxes in a shallow seasonal wetland pond: the effect of bathymetric uncertainty on predicted water and solute balances,"the successful management of groundwater dependent shallow seasonal wetlands requires a sound understanding of groundwater fluxes. however, such fluxes are hard to quantify. water volume and solute mass balance models can be used in order to derive an estimate of groundwater fluxes within such systems. this approach is particularly attractive, as it can be undertaken using measurable environmental variables, such as; rainfall, evaporation, pond level and salinity. groundwater fluxes estimated from such an approach are subject to uncertainty in the measured variables as well as in the process representation and in parameters within the model. however, the shallow nature of seasonal wetland ponds means water volume and surface area can change rapidly and non linearly with depth, requiring an accurate representation of the wetland pond bathymetry. unfortunately, detailed bathymetry is rarely available and simplifying assumptions regarding the bathymetry have to be made. however, the implications of these assumptions are typically not quantified. we systematically quantify the uncertainty implications for eight different representations of wetland bathymetry for a shallow seasonal wetland pond in south australia. the predictive uncertainty estimation methods provided in the model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis software (pest) are used to quantify the effect of bathymetric uncertainty on the modelled fluxes. we demonstrate that bathymetry can be successfully represented within the model in a simple parametric form using a cubic sexier curve, allowing an assessment of bathymetric uncertainty due to measurement error and survey detail on the derived groundwater fluxes compared with the fixed bathymetry models. findings show that different bathymetry conceptualisations can result in very different mass balance components and hence process conceptualisations, despite equally good fits to observed data, potentially leading to poor management decisions for the wetlands. model predictive uncertainty increases with the crudity of the bathymetry representation, however, approximations that capture the general shape of the wetland pond such as a power law or bezier curve show only a small increase in prediction uncertainty compared to the full dgps surveyed bathymetry, implying these may be sufficient for most modelling purposes.

Tweed et al.,2018,Science of the Total Environment,impact of irrigated agriculture on groundwater resources in a temperate humid region,"the groundwater irrigation expansion, and its multiple potential impacts on the quantity and quality of water resources, is not just restricted to areas that are water limited. in this studywe present the seasonal impacts irrigation practices can have on groundwater resources in a temperate humid region, where the average annual rain/pet ratio is 1.0. in this system the irrigation expansion is solely supported by groundwater pumping, but despite this only 5 boreholes are monitored for hydraulic head data. in this study, we compensate the scarce hydrophysical dataset by incorporating environmental tracers (major ions, delta o 18, delta h 2 and delta c 13) and dating tracers (h 3, cfc, sf6 and c 14). results indicate that at 9 of the 15 irrigation sites investigated, groundwater pumping for irrigation has induced the mixing of recent groundwater (up to <1 year) with older waters. the origin of the older waters was from either the deeper marl aquifer, or the shallow sand clay aquifer (scb) that has a c 14 mean residence time (mrt) of up to 9700 years. secondly, although high nitrate loads in infiltrating waters were being diverted via the artificial subsurface drainage system, increases in fertiliser loads have resulted in higher no3 concentrations in younger groundwater (no3: 9 45 mg/l, mrt <20 years), comparedwith older groundwater (no3 <= 9mg/l, mrt n 20 years). the changes in flow pathways, induced by irrigation, also results in seasonal declines in groundwater no3 concentrations due to mixing with olderwaters. in temperate humid areas, such evaluations of the seasonal evolution of water residence time, mixing process, and agrochemical contaminants are an important contribution to real water resources management in irrigated catchments.

Uddameri et al.,2014,Environmental Earth Sciences,a gis based multi criteria decision making approach for establishing a regional scale groundwater monitoring,"a weighted multi criteria decision making framework was designed to identify and prioritize areas for monitoring aquifer hydraulic heads within the victoria county groundwater conservation district. the criteria address salient hydrogeological aspects including groundwater variability, recharge, surfacewater groundwater interactions, and groundwater fluxes across district boundaries. texas water statutes require groundwater conservation districts to quantify these factors and utilize them to manage aquifers. a stakeholder survey instrument was used to prioritize these criteria. a monitoring priority index (mpi), whose value theoretically ranges between 0 and 1 was computed as a weighted average of six mutually exclusive criteria. the mpi value was seen to range between 0.2 and 0.6 within the study area. lower values of mpi indicate areas where the current level of monitoring is adequate and areas with a higher mpi point to locations where additional monitoring is necessary. in particular, monitoring along district boundaries, particularly along the western and southern sections, is recommended. the developed methodology was seen to provide a transparent and simple to use approach to identify and prioritize areas within the district for the purposes of groundwater monitoring. the proposed framework demonstrates the utility of gis in facilitating a scientifically credible and stakeholder driven approach for establishing groundwater monitoring networks and can be adapted in other similar applications."
Uddameri et al.,2014,Environmental Earth Sciences,a fuzzy simulation optimization approach for optimal estimation of groundwater availability under decision maker uncertainty,"as groundwater is a slowly replenishing resource that can be depleted relatively easily, there is a growing interest in actively managing aquifer resources. participatory, multi stakeholder driven approaches are increasingly being adopted to plan groundwater use such that the resource is available for present as well as future needs. the state of texas requires neighboring gcds (local regulatory bodies) within a groundwater management area (gma) to engage in joint planning activities and define desired future conditions (dfcs) for the aquifers they regulate. the dfcs are then used to estimate modeled available groundwater which defines how much water is available within an aquifer in a given region. the groundwater joint planning process was modeled using a combined simulation optimization modeling scheme in this study. the response surface methodology was used to establish regional scale aquifer stress response relationships. in addition to average county wide drawdown, other aquifer responses including stream aquifer exchanges, coastal aquifer exchanges and gma wide drawdown were considered to define the dfcs. a constrained linear regression was used in conjunction with a regional groundwater flow model to obtain the necessary response functions which formed the basis for a crisp optimization model whose objective was maximizing groundwater production while ensuring that the prescribed dfcs are not violated (constraints). this model was transformed into a fuzzy linear programming model to account for the fact that groundwater planners find it difficult to specify dfcs with a high degree of precision. using linear membership functions, the decision makers' preferences were captured using two values  a minimum preferred cut off and the maximum allowable value for the metric. for estimating groundwater availability, the fuzzy optimization model reconciles production and maximizes the goal and the constraints representing the dfcs. the developed framework was illustrated by applying it to joint planning in groundwater management area 15 in south texas. the optimization models were highly sensitive to acceptable average drawdowns, while the coastal aquifer interactions had secondary impacts. the fuzzy optimization model yielded lower estimates of groundwater availability in comparison to the crisp optimization scheme. the fuzzy optimization model is therefore consistent with the precautionary principle and recommended for use in the early stages of groundwater planning where incomplete understanding of the aquifer dynamics precludes specification of precise limits for the dfcs."

Unterbruner et al.,2016,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,understanding groundwater   students' pre conceptions and conceptual change by means of a theory guided multimedia learning program,"education on the subject of groundwater is crucial for sustainability. nevertheless, international studies with students across different age groups have shown that the basic hydrogeological concept of groundwater defined as water within porous and permeable rocks is not an established everyday notion. drawing from international research, a multimedia learning program zwischen regenwolke und wasserhahn (between the rain cloud and the tap) was developed, which incorporates specific insights from the fields of conceptual change research, multimedia research, and the model of educational reconstruction. the effectiveness of the learning program was ascertained by means of two studies with austrian seventh grade pupils as well as teacher training students from the fields of biology and geography in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the learning program. using a quasi experimental research design, the participants' conceptions and knowledge of groundwater were determined in a pre  and post test. the pupils and students greatly benefitted from working through the learning software independently. their knowledge of groundwater increased significantly compared to the control group and there was a highly significant increase in the number of scientifically correct notions of groundwater. the acceptance of the program was also generally very high. the results indicate that theory guided multimedia learning programs can play an important role in the transfer of research results to classroom settings, especially in science education."
Urqueta et al.,2018,Science of the Total Environment,land surface temperature as an indicator of the unsaturated zone thickness: a remote sensing approach in the atacama desert,"land surface temperature (lst) seems to be related to the temperature of shallow aquifers and the unsaturated zone thickness (delta z(uz)). that relationship is valid when the study area fulfils certain characteristics: a) there should be no downward moisture fluxes in an unsaturated zone, b) the soil composition in terms of both, the different horizon materials and their corresponding thermal and hydraulic properties, must be as homogeneous and isotropic as possible, c) flat and regular topography, and d) steady state groundwater temperature with a spatially homogeneous temperature distribution. a night time advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (aster) image and temperature field measurements are used to test the validity of the relationship between lst and delta z(uz) at the pampa del tamarugal, which is located in the atacama desert (chile) and meets the above required conditions. the results indicate that there is a relation between the land surface temperature and the unsaturated zone thickness in the study area. moreover, the field measurements of soil temperature indicate that shallow aquifers dampen both the daily and the seasonal amplitude of the temperature oscillation generated by the local climate conditions. despite empirically observing the relationship between the lst and delta z(uz) in the study zone, such a relationship cannot be applied to directly estimate delta z(uz) using temperatures from nighttime thermal satellite images. to this end, it is necessary to consider the soil thermal properties, the soil surface roughness and the unseen water and moisture fluxes (e.g., capillarity and evaporation) that typically occur in the subsurface.

Urrutia et al.,2018,Hydrogeology Journal,"hydrogeology and sustainable future groundwater abstraction from the agua verde aquifer in the atacama desert, northern chile","the hyper arid conditions prevailing in agua verde aquifer in northern chile make this system the most important water source for nearby towns and mining industries. due to the growing demand for water in this region, recharge is investigated along with the impact of intense pumping activity in this aquifer. a conceptual model of the hydrogeological system is developed and implemented into a two dimensional groundwater flow numerical model. to assess the impact of climate change and groundwater extraction, several scenarios are simulated considering variations in both aquifer recharge and withdrawals. the estimated average groundwater lateral recharge from precordillera (pre mountain range) is about 4,482 m(3)/day. the scenarios that consider an increase of water withdrawal show a non sustainable groundwater consumption leading to an overexploitation of the resource, because the outflows surpasses inflows, causing storage depletion. the greater the depletion, the larger the impact of recharge reduction caused by the considered future climate change. this result indicates that the combined effects of such factors may have a severe impact on groundwater availability as found in other groundwater dependent regions located in arid environments. furthermore, the scenarios that consider a reduction of the extraction flow rate show that it may be possible to partially alleviate the damage already caused to the aquifer by the continuous extractions since 1974, and it can partially counteract climate change impacts on future groundwater availability caused by a decrease in precipitation (and so in recharge), if the desalination plant in taltal increases its capacity."

Valderrama et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,the use of a hydrological economic model to assess sustainability in groundwater dependent agriculture in drylands,"this paper deals with the assessment of sustainability in the exploitation of groundwater by agriculture in arid and semi arid lands. the procedure proposed is not based on an indicator made up of a few partial, static figures, but on one which requires the use of all the information collectable for the system under assessment. this information serves to calibrate a dynamic model which formalizes the main causal chains and feedbacks existing between hydrogeology and the number of farms, this being ultimately linked to farms economy. the risk of overexploitation is worked out as the percentage of model's long term steady states, associated to a great number of different scenarios, surpassing some chosen threshold marking out sustainability from degradation. the procedure has been implemented for two study cases: the eastern la mancha aquifer (spain), where information was abundant, and the oued mird alluvial aquifer (morocco), where quantitative information was so much scarcer. significant risks of degradation have been found in both cases, especially in the moroccan one.

Valdes-Abellan et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,reactive transport modelling to infer changes in soil hydraulic properties induced by non conventional water irrigation,"the use of non conventional water (e.g., treated wastewater, desalinated water) for different purposes is increasing in many water scarce regions of the world. its use for irrigation may have potential drawbacks, because of mineral dissolution/precipitation processes, such as changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties (e.g., porosity, permeability), modifying infiltration and aquifer recharge processes or blocking root growth. prediction of soil and groundwater impacts is essential for achieving sustainable agricultural practices. a numerical model to solve unsaturated water flow and non isothermal multicomponent reactive transport has been modified implementing the spatio temporal evolution of soil physical and hydraulic properties. a long term process simulation (30 years) of agricultural irrigation with desalinated water, based on a calibrated/validated 1d numerical model in a semi arid region, is presented. different scenarios conditioning reactive transport (i.e., rainwater irrigation, lack of gypsum in the soil profile, and lower partial pressure of co2 (pco(2))) have also been considered. results show that although boundarycondition and mineral soil composition highly influence the reactive processes, dissolution/precipitation of carbonate species is triggered mainly by pco(2), closely related to plant roots. calcite dissolution occurs in the root zone, precipitation takes place under it and at the soil surface, which will lead a root growth blockage and a direct soil evaporation decrease, respectively. for the studied soil, a gypsum dissolution up to 40 cm depth is expected at long term, with a general increase of porosity and hydraulic conductivity.

Van Meter et al.,2016,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,the socioecohydrology of rainwater harvesting in india: understanding water storage and release dynamics across spatial scales,"rainwater harvesting (rwh), the small scale collection and storage of runoff for irrigated agriculture, is recognized as a sustainable strategy for ensuring food security, especially in monsoonal landscapes in the developing world. in south india, these strategies have been used for millennia to mitigate problems of water scarcity. however, in the past 100 years many traditional rwh systems have fallen into disrepair due to increasing dependence on groundwater. this dependence has contributed to accelerated decline in groundwater resources, which has in turn led to increased efforts at the state and national levels to revive older rwh systems. critical to the success of such efforts is an improved understanding of how these ancient systems function in contemporary landscapes with extensive groundwater pumping and shifted climatic regimes. knowledge is especially lacking regarding the water exchange dynamics of these rwh tanks at tank and catchment scales, and how these exchanges regulate tank performance and catchment waterbalances. here, we use fine scale, water level variation to quantify daily fluxes of groundwater, evapotranspiration (et), and sluice outflows in four tanks over the 2013 northeast monsoon season in a tank cascade that covers a catchment area of 28 km(2). at the tank scale, our results indicate that groundwater recharge and irrigation outflows comprise the largest fractions of the tank waterbudget, with et accounting for only 13 22% of the outflows. at the scale of the cascade, we observe a distinct spatial pattern in groundwater exchange dynamics, with the frequency and magnitude of groundwater inflows increasing down the cascade of tanks. the significant magnitude of return flows along the tank cascade leads to the most downgradient tank in the cascade having an outflow to capacity ratio greater than 2. at the catchment scale, the presence of tanks in the landscape dramatically alters the catchment waterbalance, with runoff decreasing by nearly 75%, and recharge increasing by more than 40%. finally, while water from the tanks directly satisfies similar to 40% of the crop water requirement across the northeast monsoon season via surfacewater irrigation, a large fraction of the tank water is 'wasted', and more efficient management of sluice outflows could lead to tanks meeting a higher fraction of crop water requirements."

van Wyk et al.,2012,Water Sa,characteristics of local groundwater recharge cycles in south african semi arid hard rock terrains: rainfall groundwater interaction,"the semi arid and arid regions occupy almost two thirds of south africa and fall in the winter and summer rainfall zones of the sub continent. the annual rainfall patterns can be regarded as intermittent with a significant spatial variability due to the unique winter/summer synoptic systems manifesting over southern africa. summer rainfall events indicate that episodic wet periods, consisting of up to 8 consecutive days, may contain falls that contribute to almost 45% to 60% of the total annual rainfall of an area; associated with relatively higher rain rates (1.5 to 10 mm.h( 1)). hyetograph hydrograph time series data sets, however, indicate that episodic rainfall events are responsible for rapid, but sustainable groundwater recharge events. the recurrence rate of these events in the semi arid and arid regions is still low and aquifer storage recharge is therefore not an annual event. the recharge flow path through the unsaturated zone reservoir plays an important role in the underdrainage flow pattern, and subsequently the saturated flow regime. it resembles a simple l shaped flow path driven by direct recharge mounding in the fractured hard rock terrain and indirect recharge to the surrounding sub reservoirs. the lag times between rainfall events and watertable responses were found to be significantly short; a matter of a few hours to less than a few days. evidence of multi modal, time related infiltration phases during the summer early and peak rainfall intervals, governed by the field capacity status of the unsaturated zone reservoir and the growth status of the local vegetation, were observed. a unique rainfall pattern in semi arid and arid regions is required before a sustainable aquifer storage recharge condition develops and such incidences could be a one in several year (5 to 9) event."
Vandenbohede et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,heat transport and temperature distribution during managed artificial recharge with surface ponds,"managed aquifer recharge (mar) is a well established practice for managing groundwater reserves in a sustainable way. in this paper, we look at the influence of temperature variations of the infiltration water in the recharged aquifer. the paper focuses on mar systems consisting of an infiltration pond surrounded by extraction wells. a number of different 20 configurations and an operational system in the belgian dune area are investigated using field observations and numerical modelling with seawat. seasonally varying temperature in the infiltration water results in a zonation of subsequent lower and higher temperatures in the aquifer. the impact of infiltration water temperature in the aquifer is significant but restricted to the area between the pond and extraction wells, quickly decreasing farther from the infiltration area. colder water during winter results in a decrease of infiltration capacity which can be as high as 1.5 2 times with respect to summer infiltration. infiltration water temperature variations equally influence residence times of the infiltrated water. in general, residence times become smaller for water infiltrated during summer and larger for water infiltrated during winter. infiltration and extraction rate, their ratios and seasonal variability, and location of extraction wells are all contributing factors to the impact of varying temperature of the infiltration water. finally, it is shown that temperature provides only a rough proxy for residence times of solutes because of the important conduction of heat.

Vema et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,hydrologic design of water harvesting structures through simulation optimization framework,"watershed management in rainfed agricultural areas of arid and semi arid regions aims at alleviating agricultural drought by employing water conservation measures. water conservation measures serve as mechanisms for recharging groundwater, and also for surface storage. while the benefits derived from these structures is widely accepted, there is increasing concern regarding their sustainability and efficiency. the application of water conservation measures in upstream reaches contributes to reduced inflows to downstream reaches and structures. currently watershed management is planned by considering elementary information about the hydrological regime and its associated impacts on the upstream reaches of the watershed. this approach may lead to inefficient water conservation structures, and there is also a significant probability that the structure may be under designed (or over designed). therefore, careful planning that considers the hydrological changes that the conservation structure may bring in the watershed and the associated benefits/compromise for both upstream and downstream is essential for developing a successful watershed management plan. a simulation optimization framework for optimal sizing of the water conservation structure considering the dual objectives of improving the benefits in the upstream reaches while maintaining flows in the downstream reaches is proposed in this study. the proposed method is demonstrated for optimal sizing of water conservation structures (check dams in this study) for an experimental watershed in kondepi mandal, andhra pradesh, india. the results indicate that the check dams of sizes obtained from both traditional method and simulation optimization method increase moisture availability in the watershed. however, for check dam sizes obtained from the simulation optimization framework, there is an increase in the flow to downstream reaches compared to the check dam sizes obtained from the traditional methods. the increase in downstream flows obtained by optimizing the check dam heights is at the expense of increased moisture stress days in the non growing period, thus, not affecting the crop growth or productivity. the results from this study indicate that the proposed simulation optimization framework can be of assistance in sizing of check dams for sustainable and effective watershed management."

Viaroli et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,the groundwaterbudget: a tool for preliminary estimation of the hydraulic connection between neighboring aquifers,"groundwater management authorities usually use groundwaterbudget calculations to evaluate the sustainability of withdrawals for different purposes. the groundwaterbudget calculation does not always provide reliable information, and it must often be supported by further aquifer monitoring in the case of hydraulic connections between neighboring aquifers. the riardo plain aquifer is a strategic drinking resource for more than 100,000 people, water storage for 60 km(2) of irrigated land, and the source of a mineral water bottling plant. over a long period, the comparison between the direct recharge and the estimated natural outflow and withdrawals highlights a severe water deficit of approximately 40% of the total groundwater outflow. a groundwaterbudget deficit should be a clue to the aquifer depletion, but the results of long term water level monitoring allowed the observation of the good condition of this aquifer. in fact, in the riardo plain, the calculated deficit is not comparable to the aquifer monitoring data acquired in the same period (1992 2014). the small oscillations of the groundwater level and the almost stable streambed spring discharge allows the presumption of an additional aquifer recharge source. the confined carbonate aquifer locally mixes with the above volcanic aquifer, providing an externally stable recharge that reduces the effects of the local rainfall variability. the combined approach of the groundwaterbudget results and long term aquifer monitoring (spring discharge and/or hydraulic head oscillation) provides information about significant external groundwater exchanges, even if unidentified by field measurements, and supports the stakeholders in groundwater resource management.

Visser et al.,2018,Hydrological Processes,importance of river water recharge to the san joaquin valley groundwater system,"groundwater is not a sustainable resource, unless abstraction is balanced by recharge. identifying the sources of recharge in a groundwater basin is critical for sustainable groundwater management. we studied the importance of river water recharge to groundwater in the south eastern san joaquin valley (24,000km(2), population 4 million). we combined dissolved noble gas concentrations, stable isotopes, tritium, and carbon 14 analyses to analyse the sources, mechanisms, and timescales of groundwater recharge. area representative groundwater sampling and numerical model input data enabled a stable isotope mass balance and quantitative estimates of river and local recharge. river recharge, identified by a lighter stable isotope signature, represents 47 +/  4% of modern groundwater in the san joaquin valley (recharged after 1950) but only 26 +/  4% of premodern groundwater (recharged before 1950). this implies that the importance of river water recharge in the san joaquin valley has nearly doubled and is likely the result of a 40% increase in total recharge, caused by river water irrigation return flows and increased stream depletion and river recharge due to groundwater pumping. compared with the large and long duration capacity for water storage in the subsurface, storage of water in rivers is limited in time and volume, as evidenced by cold river recharge temperatures resulting from fast infiltration and recharge. groundwater banking of seasonal surfacewater flows and expansion of managed aquifer recharge practices therefore appear to be a natural and promising method for increasing the resilience of the san joaquin valley water supply system."

Voortman et al.,2015,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,quantifying energy and water fluxes in dry dune ecosystems of the netherlands,"coastal and inland dunes provide various ecosystem services that are related to groundwater, such as drinking water production and biodiversity. to manage groundwater in a sustainable manner, knowledge of actual evapotranspiration (eta) for the various land covers in dunes is essential. aiming at improving the parameterization of dune vegetation in hydrometeorological models, this study explores the magnitude of energy and water fluxes in an inland dune ecosystem in the netherlands. hydrometeorological measurements were used to parameterize the penman monteith evapotranspiration model for four different surfaces: bare sand, moss, grass and heather. we found that the net longwave radiation (r nl) was the largest energy flux for most surfaces during daytime. however, modeling this flux by a calibrated fao 56 r nl model for each surface and for hourly time steps was unsuccessful. our r nl model, with a novel submodel using solar elevation angle and air temperature to describe the diurnal pattern in radiative surface temperature, improved r nl simulations considerably. model simulations of evaporation from moss surfaces showed that the modulating effect of mosses on the waterbalance is species dependent. we demonstrate that dense moss carpets (campylopus introflexus) evaporate more (5%, +14 mm) than bare sand (total of 258 mm in 2013), while more open structured mosses (hypnum cupressiforme) evaporate less (30 %, 76 mm) than bare sand. additionally, we found that a drought event in the summer of 2013 showed a pronounced delayed signal on lysimeter measurements of eta for the grass and heather surfaces, respectively. due to the desiccation of leaves after the drought event, and their feedback on the surface resistance, the potential evapotranspiration in the year 2013 dropped by 9% (37 mm) and 10% (61 mm) for the grass and heather surfaces, respectively, which subsequently led to lowered eta of 8% (29 mm) and 7% (29 mm). these feedbacks are of importance for water resources, especially during a changing climate with an increasing number of drought days. therefore, such feedbacks need to be integrated into a coupled plant physiological and hydrometeorological model to accurately simulate eta. in addition, our study showed that groundwater recharge in dunes can be increased considerably by promoting moss vegetation, especially of open structured moss species."
Voudouris et al.,2013,Water,hydrogeological characteristics of hellenic aqueducts like qanats,"in ancient hellas, water management began in the early minoan era (ca. 3200 1100 bc) and was related to the geomorphology, the geology, the topography, and the local climatic, hydrological, and socio political conditions. historical and archaeological evidences show that ancient greeks had developed even qanat related technologies since the classical times. during democratic periods, the focus of water management was on sustainable small scale, safe, and cost effective management practices, and institutional arrangements, whereas in oligarchic periods, emphasis was on the construction of large scale hydraulic projects, including aqueducts and/or qanats, mostly related to the public sectors. aqueducts like qanats are gently sloping, artificially constructed underground galleries, which bring groundwater from the mountainous area to the lowlands, where water is used, sometimes several kilometers away. it is worth noticing that no large scale lifting techniques were available, and water was transferred from the source (usually a spring) by aqueducts (qanats) from a higher elevation to a lower level by gravity. historically, the aqueduct like qanat technology was developed by persians in the middle of 1st millennium bc, and spread towards the arabian peninsula and egypt. the expansion of islam led to diffusion of qanats in mediterranean countries (e. g., spain, italy, and cyprus). much of the population of iran and other arid countries in north africa and in asia depend on water supply by aqueducts like qanats, even today. this technology is characterized by its durability and sustainability, although an aqueduct like qanat is expensive, both in construction and maintenance. it is pointed out that, the technique of tunneling was used during the classical period in ancient hellas. since the well known tunnel at the island of samos, hellas, was designed and constructed by eupalinos (ca. 530 bc), several underground tunnels (with and without well like vertical shafts) in order to convey water from one location to another one located in a lower level were implemented in this country. several aqueducts (qanat) paradigms (e. g., in athens, on islands of crete and rhodes, and in the area of serres in north country), which are in use even today, are presented and discussed. overall, it seems that water related problems of modern societies are not very different from those during antiquity."
Vouillamoz et al.,2012,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"quantifying aquifer properties and freshwater resource in coastal barriers: a hydrogeophysical approach applied at sasihithlu (karnataka state, india)","many human communities living in coastal areas in africa and asia rely on thin freshwater lenses for their domestic supply. population growth together with change in rainfall patterns and sea level will probably impact these vulnerable groundwater resources. spatial knowledge of the aquifer properties and creation of a groundwater model are required for achieving a sustainable management of the resource. this paper presents a ready to use methodology for estimating the key aquifer properties and the freshwater resource based on the joint use of two non invasive geophysical tools together with common hydrological measurements. we applied the proposed methodology in an unconfined aquifer of a coastal sandy barrier in south western india. we jointly used magnetic resonance and transient electromagnetic soundings and we monitored rainfall, groundwater level and groundwater electrical conductivity. the combined interpretation of geophysical and hydrological results allowed estimating the aquifer properties and mapping the freshwater lens. depending on the location and season, we estimate the freshwater reserve to range between 400 and 700 l m( 2) of surface area (+/  50%). we also estimate the recharge using time lapse geophysical measurements with hydrological monitoring. after a rainy event close to 100% of the rain is reaching the watertable, but the net recharge at the end of the monsoon is less than 10% of the rain. thus, we conclude that a change in rainfall patterns will probably not impact the groundwater resource since most of the rain water recharging the aquifer is flowing towards the sea and the river. however, a change in sea level will impact both the groundwater reserve and net recharge."
Wable et al.,2017,Environmental Earth Sciences,evaluation of groundwater resources for sustainable groundwater development in a semiarid river basin of india,"there is a growing stress on groundwater due to increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts, and the limited availability of surfacewater. therefore, proper assessment of available groundwater reserves is highly essential at a microscale (e.g., block level) to take into account spatial variability. in this paper, a methodology for the effective assessment of groundwater resources is demonstrated considering a semiarid river basin of western india as a study area. the rainfall data of nine raingauge stations and seasonal groundwater level data of 132 sites over the basin for 20 years (1990 2009) were used. groundwater availability in the unconfined aquifer was evaluated at a block level in terms of 'static groundwater reserve (sgwr)' and 'dynamic groundwater reserve (dgwr),' and their spatial and temporal variabilities were analyzed. furthermore, the status of groundwater utilization in individual blocks was explored considering the level of groundwater development (gwdl) and the trends of long term seasonal groundwater levels. to sustain available groundwater resources on a long term basis, the runoff potential in the study area was also evaluated. it was found that sgwr varies from 0.09 to 136.97 mcm (million cubic meters), whereas dgwr ranges from  35.85 to 156.26 mcm. during 'normal' years, around 43% of the study area has a sgwr in the range of 20 40 mcm and dgwr in the range of 0 50 mcm. although the gwdl in the study area varies from about 12 to 124%, the status of groundwater development in the study area is categorized to be 'safe.' the analysis of runoff potential in the study area revealed that it considerably varies with time and space. about 71% of the study area is suitable for rainwater conservation during 'wet' years, whereas this figure reduces to 33% in 'normal' years. it is emphasized that regular monitoring of groundwater at a suitable spatial scale (at least block level) is necessary on long term basis and the adoption of rainwater harvesting measures are indispensable for sustainable utilization and management of groundwater resources in semiarid regions."

Wang et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,modelling the effects of land cover and climate change on soil water partitioning in a boreal headwater catchment,"climate and land cover are two major factors affecting the water fluxes and balance across spatiotemporal scales. these two factors and their impacts on hydrology are often interlinked. the quantification and differentiation of such impacts is important for developing sustainable land and water management strategies. here, we calibrated the well known hydrus 1d model in a data rich boreal headwater catchment in scotland to assess the role of two dominant vegetation types (shrubs vs. trees) in regulating the soil water partitioning and balance. we also applied previously established climate projections for the area and replaced shrubs with trees to imitate current landuse change proposals in the region, so as to quantify the potential impacts of climate and land cover changes on soil hydrology. under tree cover, evapotranspiration and deep percolation to recharge groundwater was about 44% and 57% of annual precipitation, whilst they were about 10% lower and 9% higher respectively under shrub cover in this humid, low energy environment. meanwhile, tree canopies intercepted 39% of annual precipitation in comparison to 23% by shrubs. soils with shrub cover stored more water than tree cover. land cover change was shown to have stronger impacts than projected climate change. with a complete replacement of shrubs with trees under future climate projections at this site, evapotranspiration is expected to increase by similar to 39% while percolation to decrease by 21% relative to the current level, more pronounced than the modest changes in the two components (<8%) with climate change only. the impacts would be particularly marked in warm seasons, which may result in water stress experienced by the vegetation. the findings provide an important evidence base for adaptivemanagement strategies of future changes in low energy humid environments, where vegetation growth is usually restricted by radiative energy and not water availability while few studies that quantify soil water partitioning exist.

Wang et al.,2016,Hydrogeology Journal,investigation of discharge area groundwaters for recharge source characterization on different scales: the case of jinan in northern china,"discharge area groundwater in jinan, a typical karst region in northern china, was investigated by studying both the hydrological and chemical processes evolving from the recharge in mountainous terrains to the karst spring outflows in the metropolitan area. large scale exploitation of karst groundwater has led to a disturbing trend in the ever decreasing spring outflow rates and groundwater level. there is insufficient information about the jinan karst aquifers, which provide the main water sources to meet human demand and to sustain spring outflow. the coupling of hydrological and chemical processes quantifies the flow system through aqueous chemistry characterization of the water sources. this approach is used to study the groundwater flow discharges in different locations and geological settings. the potentiometric data indicated limited vertical connectivity between distinct hydrogeological units and alteration of the recharge regime by the faults and by artificial exploitation. shallow groundwater primarily belongs to the local flow system, with high nitrate concentration and enriched stable isotopic contents. thermal groundwater has high concentrations of chloride and total dissolved solids, derived from a regional flow system with the highest recharge altitudes and long residence time. non thermal karst water may be attributed to the intermediate flow system, with uniform hco3 ca(mg) facies and low nitrate concentration. this work highlighted discharge as a fingerprint of groundwater flow conditions and provides a better insight into the hydrogeological system."

Werner et al.,2011,Water Resources Management,current practice and future challenges in coastal aquifer management: flux based and trigger level approaches with application to an australian case study,"the control of groundwater abstraction from coastal aquifers is typically aimed at minimizing the risk of seawater intrusion, excessive storage depletion and adverse impacts on groundwater dependent ecosystems. published approaches to the operational management of groundwater abstraction from regulated coastal aquifers comprise elements of ""trigger level management"" and ""flux based management"". trigger level management relies on measured groundwater levels, groundwater salinities and/or ecosystem health indicators, which are compared to objective values (trigger levels), thereby invoking management responses (e.g. pumping cut backs). flux based management apportions groundwater abstraction rates based on estimates of aquifer recharge and discharge (including environmental water requirements). this paper offers a critical evaluation of coastal aquifer management paradigms using published coastal aquifer case studies combined with a simple evaluation of the uley south coastal aquifer, south australia. there is evidence that trigger level management offers advantages over flux based approaches through the evaluation of real time resource conditions and trends, allowing for management responses aimed at protecting against water quality deterioration and excessive storage depletion. however, flux based approaches are critical for planning purposes, and are required to predict aquifer responses to climatic and pumping stresses. a simplified modelling analysis of the uley south basin responses to different management strategies demonstrates the advantages of considering a hybrid management approach that includes both trigger level and flux based controls. it is recommended that where possible, trigger level and flux based approaches be adopted conjunctively to minimize the risk of coastal groundwater degradation and to underpin strategies for future aquifer management and well field operation."
Werner et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,hydrogeology and management of freshwater lenses on atoll islands: review of current knowledge and research needs,"on atoll islands, fresh groundwater occurs as a buoyant lens shaped body surrounded by saltwater derived from the sea, forming the main freshwater source for many island communities. a review of the state of knowledge of atoll island groundwater is overdue given their susceptibility to adverse impacts, and the task to address water access and sanitation issues within the united nations' sustainable development goals framework before the year 2030. in this article, we review available literature to summarise the key processes, investigation techniques and management approaches of atoll island groundwater systems. over fifty years of investigation has led to important advancements in the understanding of atoll hydrogeology, but a paucity of hydrogeological data persists on all but a small number of atoll islands. we find that the combined effects of buoyancy forces, complex geology, tides, episodic ocean events, strong climatic variability and human impacts create highly dynamic fresh groundwater lenses. methods used to quantify freshwater availability range from simple empirical relationships to three dimensional density dependent models. generic atoll island numerical models have proven popular in trying to unravel the individual factors controlling fresh groundwater lens behaviour. major challenges face the inhabitants and custodians of atoll island aquifers, with rising anthropogenic stresses compounded by the threats of climate variability and change, sea level rise, and some atolls already extracting freshwater at or above sustainability limits. we find that the study of atoll groundwater systems remains a critical area for further research effort to address persistent knowledge gaps, which lead to high uncertainties in water security issues for both island residents and surrounding environs.

Werner et al.,2013,Water Resources Management,an initial inventory and indexation of groundwater mega depletion cases,"the state of groundwater systems worldwide is presently not well defined, and in particular there is little context for agencies responsible for managing water resources to evaluate occurrences of groundwater depletion against other cases globally. in this study, an initial inventory of groundwater depletion problems is compiled and ranked to identify the world's most critical cases, i.e. situations of groundwater mega depletion. the ranking is based on an indexed approach that considers overdraft, drawdown and subsidence, plus the importance of the resources in terms of population dependency and rates of extraction. the five most highly ranked depleted aquifers of the world include the shallow aquifers of the hai river plain (china), the altiplano region (spain), the mexico basin (mexico), the huang river basin (china) and the california central valley (usa). an abridged account of modelling to assess drawdown is described for the hai river plain, revealing that despite recharge in the order of 13,000 gl/yr, an overdraft of about 8,000 gl/yr is occurring to support the vast population of the region. this has led to up to 100 m of drawdown in places and reports of subsidence of several metres. the hai river situation demonstrates that falling water levels may not act to alleviate pumping stresses; a symptom of unchecked extraction and an exemplary illustration of the tragedy of the commons. the causal factors leading to mega depletion are varying across the globe and each mega depletion case contains unique elements, although population appears to be an important factor."

Wohling et al.,2018,Groundwater,quantifying river groundwater interactions of new zealand's gravel bed rivers: the wairau plain,"new zealand's gravel bed rivers have deposited coarse, highly conductive gravel aquifers that are predominantly fed by river water. managing their groundwater resources is challenging because the recharge mechanisms in these rivers are poorly understood and recharge rates are difficult to predict, particularly under a more variable future climate. to understand the river groundwater exchange processes in gravel bed rivers, we investigate the wairau plain aquifer using a three dimensional groundwater flow model which was calibrated using targeted field observations, ""soft"" information from experts of the local water authority, parameter regularization techniques, and the model independent parameter estimation software pest. the uncertainty of simulated river aquifer exchange flows, groundwater heads, spring flows, and mean transit times were evaluated using null space monte carlo methods. our analysis suggests that the river is hydraulically perched (losing) above the regional watertable in its upper reaches and is gaining downstream where marine sediments overlay unconfined gravels. river recharge rates are on average 7.3 m(3)/s, but are highly dynamic in time and variable in space. although the river discharge regularly hits 1000 m(3)/s, the net exchange flow rarely exceeds 12 m(3)/s and seems to be limited by the physical constraints of unit gradient flux under disconnected rivers. an important finding for the management of the aquifer is that changes in aquifer storage are mainly affected by the frequency and duration of low flow periods in the river. we hypothesize that the new insights into the river groundwater exchange mechanisms of the presented case study are transferable to other rivers with similar characteristics."

Xian et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,impact of lateral flow on the transition from connected to disconnected stream aquifer systems,"understanding the mechanisms by which stream water infiltrates through streambeds to recharge groundwater systems is essential to sustainable management of scarce water resources in arid and semi arid areas. an inverted watertable (iwt) can develop under a stream in response to the desaturation between the stream and underlying aquifer as the system changes from a connected to disconnected status. however, previous studies have suggested that the iwt can only occur at the bottom of a low permeability streambed in which only the vertical flow between the stream and groundwater during disconnection was assumed. in the present study, numerical simulations revealed that the lateral flow induced by capillarity or heterogeneity also plays an essential role on interactions between streams and aquifers. three pathways were identified for the transition from connection to disconnection in homogenous systems; notably, the lowest point of an iwt can develop not only at the bottom of the streambed but also within the streambed or the aquifer in response to the initial desaturation at, above, or below the interface between the streambed and aquifer (ibsa), respectively. a sensitivityanalysis indicated that in wide streams, the lowest point of an iwt only occurs at the bottom of the streambed; however, for a stream half width of 1 m above a 6 m thick sandy loam streambed, the lowest point occurs in the streambed as stream depth is less than 0.5 m. this critical stream depth increases with streambed thickness and decreases with stream width. thus, in narrow streams the lowest point can also develop in a thick streambed under a shallow stream. in narrow streams, the lowest point also forms in the aquifer if the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed to that of the aquifer is greater than the ratio of the streambed thickness to the sum of the stream depth and the streambed thickness; correspondingly, the streambed is thin but relatively permeable and the stream is deep. furthermore, in heterogeneous streambed systems, two or three pathways can simultaneously occur and various parts of the iwt occur at distinct positions relative to the ibsa. this challenges the commonly held assumption that streambed under a disconnected stream is always fully saturated, and limits the methods which introduce a negative or atmospheric pressure value at the ibsa to calculate seepage rate or assess stream aquifer connectivity.

Xie et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a water and energy balance model,"coupled water and energy balance models have become increasingly popular for estimating groundwater recharge, because of the integration of energy and waterbalances and sometimes carbon balance. the additional balances are thought to constrain the waterbalance and as a result should help reduce the uncertainty of groundwater recharge. however, these models usually have a large number of parameters. the uncertainty of these parameters may result in a large uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimates. this study aims to assess the potential uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a widely used water and energy model. it is largely based on annual pasture vegetation in the lower part of the campaspe catchment in southeast australia. a monte carlo analysis method was employed to examine potential uncertainties introduced by different types of errors. the results show that for a mean rainfall of 398 mm/y and using a particular set of pedotransfer functions for deriving soil hydraulic parameters, the estimated recharge ranged from 7 to 144 mm/y due to the uncertainty in vegetation parameters. this upper bound of the recharge range increased to 236 mm/y when using different sets of pedotransfer functions. through several synthetic test cases, this study shows that soil moisture time series may not offer much help for reducing recharge uncertainty, whereas evapotranspiration time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50%. the reduction in recharge uncertainty steadily improves as the uncertainty in observations reduces.

Xu et al.,2017,Polish Journal of Environmental Studies,river health evaluation based on the fuzzy matter element extension assessment model,"the measured values of river health indexes that are not necessarily in the same range of a certain health grade level cause the problem of how to classify the actual status of river health. to solve such incompatibility and evaluate the health condition of a river ecosystem objectively we can use the river health integrated index (rhi), which was determined by the fuzzy matter element extension assessment model (fmeam). fmeam was established by combining the fuzzy matter element extension assessment method with the proposed aggregative index system. by employing the model above, as well as data from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, we evaluated the health state of the luanhe river. the results showed that the luanhe river was in a sub healthy state in the 1980s and in an unhealthy state in the 1990s and 2000s. the reasons leading to the luanhe river's health degradation have been analyzed. among them, water conservation projects' building and operations are the major influence factors. waste water emissions, the expansion of urban built up areas, overexploitation of groundwater, and other unreasonable human activities also intensified the river ecosystem degradation. finally, countermeasures for the ecological restoration and protection of the river were put forward."
Xu et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,integration of swap and modflow 2000 for modeling groundwater dynamics in shallow watertable areas,"reasonable estimates of groundwater recharge and discharge through evapotranspiration is critical for sustainable water resources management in shallow watertable areas. the hydrologic processes are highly interactive between the vadose zone and groundwater under shallow watertable conditions. in traditional groundwater flow models, the recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes are often oversimplified as a simple sink/source term. however, the recharge and evapotranspiration are observed to vary with topography, soil type, landuse, and water management practices. additionally, they are known to vary temporally and spatially and are difficult to estimate, especially in arid and semi arid regions. thus, it is important to devise an appropriate method to estimate the recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes in groundwater modeling. in this study, a soil water atmosphere plant (swap) package was integrated into a groundwater flow model (modflow) in such a way that the swap package calculates vertical flux for modflow, while modflow provides averaged watertable depth to determine the bottom boundarycondition for swap zones. the swap zones in modflow are derived from a combination of topology, soil type, landuse, water management practices using geographic information systems (gis). then the modflow with swap package was tested using a two dimensional saturated unsaturated watertable recharge experiment. results showed that the simulated watertable elevations matched well with the observed ones except at the early period during which they were slightly higher than the observed ones, probably due to neglecting lateral diffusion in the unsaturated zone. finally, we applied modflow with swap package to simulate a regional groundwater flow problem in hetao irrigation district, upper yellow river basin of north china. the simulation results validated the applicability of the developed modflow with swap package for practical regional groundwater modeling.

Xue et al.,2017,Agricultural Water Management,water saving practices enhance regional efficiency of water consumption and water productivity in an arid agricultural area with shallow groundwater,"improving the efficiency of water consumption and water productivity is the key approach to satisfy sustainable water resource supply and food demand. as effective measures, water saving practices are implemented in arid and semi arid regions. for areas with shallow groundwater, water used for irrigation is not entirely consumptively used. the majority of irrigation water infiltrations below the root zone are stored in shallow groundwater. this can be reused as groundwater based evapotranspiration (etg) at the regional scale. thus, actual regional efficiency of water consumption (rewc) based on all water within the hydrological system is greater than based on consumptive use only. accurately evaluating the response of rewc and regional water productivity (rwp) to water saving practices is essential due to the complexity of the hydrological system. in this study, regional etg and regional evapotranspiration (et) of the past 20 years were reproduced in a typical arid irrigation district with shallow groundwater based on the waterbalance method. furthermore, rewc and rwp were estimated to investigate the impact of water saving practices to regional water use. simulation results show that groundwater is a significant water source of regional et in arid regions with a shallow aquifer and contributes more than 16% of regional et for the irrigation district. water saving practice implementation enhances the contribution of groundwater to et. after water saving practices implementation, annual rewc and rwp have been improved by 0.07 and 0.1 kg/m(3), respectively. furthermore, negative correlation between rewc and i + p (the total water supply including rainfall and irrigation water diversion) and positive correlation between rwp and rewc demonstrate that water saving practices can reduce the non beneficial water losses by evaporation and enhance productivity by a lower groundwatertable. overall, shallow groundwater plays an important role to enhance rewc and rwp and the contribution of groundwater to regional water use needs to be considered as part of a reasonable water saving strategy towards a sustainable agricultural system.

Yidana et al.,2015,International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,numerical analysis of groundwater flow and potential in parts of a crystalline aquifer system in northern ghana,"the groundwater flow system in a crystalline aquifer system in parts of northern ghana was simulated and calibrated under steady state conditions. the objective was to estimate the regional distribution of a key aquifer hydraulic parameter (the hydraulic conductivity) and recharge and also to predict possible effects of different abstraction and groundwater recharge scenarios on the sustainability of groundwater resources in the area. the study finds that the hydraulic conductivity field is quite homogeneous and has values ranging between 1.70 and 2.24 m/day. there is an apparent dominance of regional groundwater flow systems compared to local flow systems. this is probably attributed to the homogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field and the absence of complex local relief. estimated groundwater recharge ranges between 0.036 and 0.164 m/yr representing 3.6 and 16.4 % of the local annual precipitation, respectively. substantial subsurface inflows and outflows have also been simulated through general head boundaries. the simulation suggests that under the current conditions of groundwater recharge estimated at calibration, the system can sustain increment in groundwater abstraction by up to 50 % without any significant changes in the groundwater flow geometry and drawdowns in the hydraulic heads. however, significant drawdowns will be expected in the wake of 100 % increment in groundwater abstraction and a reduction in recharge by 10 % during the 20 year period. under such conditions, the flow geometry will significantly be altered and a reversal in groundwater flow will be observed."
Yihdego et al.,2016,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,"mine water supply assessment and evaluation of the system response to the designed demand in a desert region, central saudi arabia","the efficient use of water resources in arid region has become highly relevant in the evaluation and mining planning, since the exploration phase to closure. the objective of the numerical groundwater model was to assess the potential for groundwater extraction to meet mine water demand from one of the driest area in the world. numerical groundwater models were used to assess groundwater resource. modelling was undertaken using modflow surfact code, an advanced modflow based code, within the framework of visual modflow version 4.6. a steady state model was developed to assess the regional groundwater flow pattern and to calibrate the recharge and hydraulic conductivity parameters in the model. the model was calibrated with a correlation of coefficient of 0.997, and root mean squared error is 0.3 m. a transient simulation model was used to predict the impact of 1.5 million cubic metre/year extraction for 10 years on the main aquifer hydrogeological regime, including after cession of pumping. modelling simulated four hydrogeological scenarios. model results for the 'worst case' scenario suggested that the saq sandstone aquifer should be capable of supplying the mine water demand (1.5 million cubic metre (mcm)/year) for 10 years. however, the long term water level drawdown shows a continuous decrease without achieving steady state conditions; thus, the majority of water is being taken from aquifer storage, and in the long term, there will be a mutual interference from a borefield located to the north of the model area. in this area, the hydraulic gradient is relatively steep and over pumped for more than 28 years. other scenario shows that there will be a recovery of around 8 m out of the 11.6 m drawdown, after 18 years of cession of pumping, implying that the aquifer will be stressed and a large percentage of water taken from aquifer storage. to minimise hydrogeological impacts, it is recommended to laterally spread out production bores, bores should be located where the saq sandstone is deepest, and operate the bores at low extraction rates. overall, this study presents a useful numerical model output for mine water supply assessment and will contribute towards improving water resources management under different conditions in one of the world driest area."
Yihdego et al.,2017,Hydrology,groundwater resources assessment and impact analysis using a conceptual waterbalance model and time series data analysis: case of decision making tool,"the allocation of groundwater resources has been a challenge for many years due to its unforeseen side effect and lag time issues, which are often overlooked. the full impact of groundwater utilization/abstraction takes time to realize its effect at its full. in this paper, long term effects and groundwater dynamics were assessed using a waterbalance model and a time series analysis, respectively. undeveloped groundwater systems are commonly found in a state of equilibrium, where, on average, equal amounts of water are recharged and discharged. a waterbudget is a static accounting of the state of the system at a given time, often before the system is developed. waterbalance analysis was carried out together with the groundwater through flow, hydrograph, and surface groundwater interaction analysis (base flow index) to develop a conceptual waterbalance model, which is a very basic representation of a complex natural aquifer system and is instrumental to constrain and build a robust numerical model that can be readily justified and updated. a noble approach was employed to assess and constrain the discharge coming out of the model area to sustain the lake level, located to the north of the study area, using the whole lake catchment and lake waterbalance analysis. based on the lake waterbalance, there is a deficit between input and output computation, and hence there should be a groundwater input to sustain the historical lake area. the analysis showed that the model area contributes 40% of the lake catchment, and hence the portion of the groundwater inflow feeding the lake was computed. this is one of the means to constrain the discharge, which adds more confidence to the recharge estimation. this is very important because the size of a sustainable groundwater development usually depends on how much of the discharge from the system can be captured by the development. capture is independent of the recharge. instead, it depends on the dynamic response of the aquifer system to the development. the idea that knowing the recharge is important in determining the size of a sustainable groundwater development is a myth and has no basis. the important entity in determining how a groundwater system reaches a new equilibrium is capture. how capture occurs in an aquifer system is a dynamic process. following this study, lake waterbalance assessment was indirectly considered as prior information for the numerical model calibration of the discharge from the model area using a conductance parameter. conductance is a key parameter to estimate the discharge volume together with the change in the simulated hydraulic head between time steps. the waterbalance error highlights which one is more sensitive, and this could help to assist in planning for future data collection/field work and where to invest the money. the waterbalance computation helps to figure out the degree of surface groundwater interaction, uncertainty, sensitive parameter, helps in the decision to invest time and money, and operates as a cross check with other analytical or numerical modelling."

Yin et al.,2011,Water Resources Management,"assessment of sustainable yield of karst water in huaibei, china","this paper presents the assessment of sustainable yield in the huaibei karst water area of anhui province, china. a review of sustainable yield definition is introduced first in this paper, and sustainable development in karst areas is more difficult due to the complicated hydrogeologic conditions. general hydrogeology of the study area is provided to characterize hydraulic connections between the karst aquifer and an overlying porous aquifer. groundwater level declines continuously due to overexploitation of the karst groundwater, and two layers of groundwater dropping funnel were formed in huaibei. these problems not only threaten the eco geo environment, but also compromise the water utilization which depends on the shallow porous water. a ""critical water level"" is proposed in this study to assess the sustainable yield, and it is determined by the historical exploitation data which represent the relationship between the karst water and the shallow porous water uses. a three layer artificial neural network (ann) model is used to understand the complex relationship of the karst water level and its influencing factors. precipitation, exploitation and water level of latest period are chosen as the input nodes, seasonal records of water level are simulated by the ann model. the sustainable yield is calculated by the trail and error adjusting method, and is equal to the pumping rate when the ""critical water level"" is maintained. the rate of 30.05 mcm/a is the sustainable yield for the huaibei karst area in 2008, and it is less than the real pumping rate of 35.92 mcm/a. this assessment is meaningful to the management for the huaibei karst water."

Yin et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,interaction between groundwater and trees in an arid site: potential impacts of climate variation and groundwater abstraction on trees,"the understanding of the interaction between groundwater and trees is vital for sustainable groundwater use and maintenance of a healthy ecosystem in arid regions. the short  and long term groundwater contribution to tree water use was investigated using the hydrus 1d model and stable isotopes. for the short term simulation, the ratio between the actual transpiration (t a) and potential transpiration (t p) approached almost similar to 1.0 due to the constant groundwater uptake. the results from the short term simulation indicated that the groundwater contribution to tree water use ranged between 53% and 56% in the dry season (may june) and 16 19% in the wet period (august september). isotopic analysis indicated that groundwater contributed to 45% of plant water use in the dry season, decreasing to 4 12% during the wet period. because of canopy interception and transpiration, groundwater recharge only occurred after heavy rainfall and accounted for 3 8% of the total heavy rainfall. for the long term simulation, t a/t p ranged between 0.91 and 1.00 except in 2007 (0.78), when the watertable declined because of groundwater abstraction. in the scenario simulation for deep watertable conditions caused by anthropogenic activities, t a/t p ranged between 0.09 and 0.40 (mean = 0.22) that is significantly lower than the values in the natural conditions. in conclusion, vegetation restoration in arid zones should be cautious as over planting of trees will decrease the groundwater recharge and potentially cause a rapid drop in watertable levels, which in turn may result in the death of planted trees. trees adapt to arid regions by adopting root patterns that allow soil water uptake by shallow roots and groundwater use by deep roots, thus climatic variation itself may not bring severe negative impact on trees. however, anthropogenic activities, such as groundwater abstraction, will result in significant watertable decline that will reduce actual transpiration of trees significantly according to the results from the scenario simulation.

Yu et al.,2018,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,groundwater impacts on surfacewater quality and nutrient loads in lowland polder catchments: monitoring the greater amsterdam area,"the amsterdam area, a highly manipulated delta area formed by polders and reclaimed lakes, struggles with high nutrient levels in its surfacewater system. the polders receive spatially and temporally variable amounts of water and nutrients via surface runoff, groundwater seepage, sewer leakage, and via water inlets from upstream polders. diffuse anthropogenic sources, such as manure and fertiliser use and atmospheric deposition, add to the water quality problems in the polders. the major nutrient sources and pathways have not yet been clarified due to the complex hydrological system in lowland catchments with both urban and agricultural areas. in this study, the spatial variability of the groundwater seepage impact was identified by exploiting the dense groundwater and surfacewater monitoring networks in amsterdam and its surrounding polders. a total of 25 variables (concentrations of total nitrogen (tn), total phosphorus (tp), nh4, no3, hco3, so4, ca, and cl in surfacewater and groundwater, n and p agricultural inputs, seepage rate, elevation, landuse, and soil type) for 144 polders were analysed statistically and interpreted in relation to sources, transport mechanisms, and pathways. the results imply that groundwater is a large source of nutrients in the greater amsterdam mixed urban agricultural catchments. the groundwater nutrient concentrations exceeded the surfacewater environmental quality standards (eqss) in 93% of the polders for tp and in 91% for tn. groundwater outflow into the polders thus adds to nutrient levels in the surfacewater. high correlations (r 2 up to 0.88) between solutes in groundwater and surfacewater, together with the close similarities in their spatial patterns, confirmed the large impact of groundwater on surfacewater chemistry, especially in the polders that have high seepage rates. our analysis indicates that the elevated nutrient and bicarbonate concentrations in the groundwater seepage originate from the decomposition of organic matter in subsurface sediments coupled to sulfate reduction and possibly methanogenesis. the large loads of nutrient rich groundwater seepage into the deepest polders indirectly affect surfacewater quality in the surrounding area, because excess water from the deep polders is pumped out and used to supply water to the surrounding infiltrating polders in dry periods. the study shows the importance of the connection between groundwater and surfacewater nutrient chemistry in the greater amsterdam area. we expect that taking account of groundwater surfacewater interaction is also important in other subsiding and urbanising deltas around the world, where water is managed intensively in order to enable agricultural productivity and achieve water sustainable cities."
Yuan et al.,2018,Geomechanics and Engineering,hydraulic conductivity estimation by considering the existence of piles: a case study,"estimation of hydraulic parameters is a critical step during design of foundation dewatering works. when many piles are installed in an aquifer, estimation of the hydraulic conductivity should consider the blocking of groundwater seepage by the piles. based on field observations during a dewatering project in shanghai, hydraulic conductivities are back calculated using a numerical model considering the actual position of each pile. however, it is difficult to apply the aforementioned model directly in field due to requirement to input each pile geometry into the model. to develop a simple numerical model and find the optimal hydraulic conductivity, three scenarios are examined, in which the soil mass containing the piles is considered to be a uniform porous media. in these three scenarios, different sub regions with different hydraulic conductivities, based on either automatic inverted calculation, or on effective medium theory (emt), are established. the results indicate that the error, in the case which determines the hydraulic conductivity based on emt, is less than that determined in the automatic inversion case. with the application of emt, only the hydraulic conductivity of the soil outside the pit should be inverted. the soil inside the pit with its piles is divided into sub regions with different hydraulic conductivities, and the hydraulic conductivity is calculated according to the volume ratio of the piles. thus, the use of emt in numerical modelling makes it easier to consider the effect of piles installed in an aquifer."

Zarroca et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,"electrical methods (ves and ert) for identifying, mapping and monitoring different saline domains in a coastal plain region (alt emporda, northern spain)","the spatial variability through time of the degree of salinity of soils and groundwater is a major issue concerning the sustainable management of water resources. the problem is accentuated in coastal plain areas where saline bodies of different origin coexist. we present an extensive geoelectrical resistivity dataset collected in the alt emporda clastic coastal aquifer system (ne spain) integrating the results of field campaigns undertaken within a period of more than two decades. the dataset is unique in the literature and comprises highly valuable information for the investigation of saline domains. the joint application of vertical electrical sounding (ves) and electrical resistivity tomography (ert) methods allowed the identification of saline domains and monitoring their evolution through time. geophysical data gathered during field campaigns in 1982, 2002 and 2010 were calibrated and interpreted on the basis of soil and groundwater physico chemical analyses and hydrogeological, stratigraphic and geomorphological data. the results illustrate the potential of electrical resistivity methods at differentiating saline domains in coastal aquifer areas and at modelling their configuration and evolution. although the ves data processing allows solving the one dimensional resistivity structure of the subsurface, the inversion imposes a 1d layered model, thus interpretation of two dimensional structures is subject to the interpolation between discrete measures. in contrast, ert data offer a continuous 2d image of the resistivity distribution, both laterally and in depth. given that the bulk resistivity of the medium is extremely sensitive to salt content, the ert profiles permitted identifying and determining the geometry of hyper saline areas (characterized by resistivities of less than 5 omega m). the study demonstrates the efficiency of the electrical methods to map subsurface conductive zones and illustrates how the accurate knowledge of the hydrogeological pattern results critical to meet this objective.

Zellner et al.,2012,Journal of Environmental Planning and Management,examining the contradiction in 'sustainable urban growth': an example of groundwater sustainability,"the environmental planning literature proposes a set of 'best management practices' for urban development that assumes improvement in environmental quality as a result of specific urban patterns. these best management practices, however, often do not recognise finite biophysical limits and social impacts that urban patterns alone cannot overcome. to shed light on this debate, we explore the effects of different degrees of urban clustering on groundwater levels using a coupled landuse change and groundwater flow model. our simulations show that specific urban forms only slow down the impact on groundwater. as population increases, the pattern in which it is accommodated ceases to matter, and widespread depletion ensues. these results are predictable, yet current planning practice tends to take growth for granted and is reluctant to envision either no growth scenarios or the prospect of depletion. we propose to use simulations such as those presented here to aid in policy discussions that allow decision makers to question the assumption of sustainable growth and suggest alternative forms of development."
Zeng et al.,2014,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,analyzing streamflow changes: irrigation enhanced interaction between aquifer and streamflow in the republican river basin,"groundwater fed irrigation has altered surface and groundwater interactions in the republic river basin (rrb) in the midwestern united states, where agriculture heavily depends on irrigation. the decreasing flow trend recorded at the rrb gauging station since the 1950s reflects the synthetical effect of dynamic interactions between surfacewater and groundwater systems, which has been enhanced by groundwater pumping and irrigation return flow. this study uses a systematic modeling approach to analyze the conjunctive effects of pumping and return flow on streamflow. a watershed management model, the soil and water assessment tool (swat), is modified and established for the frenchman creek basin (fcb), a subbasin of rrb, to examine the causes of streamflow changes. the baseflow component in swat is linked to aquifer storage so that the model can simulate the combined effects of groundwater pumping and irrigation return flow on natural streamflow. results show that irrigation has not only depleted streamflow but also changed the flow pattern and seasonal variability. the changes can be decomposed into decrease in the slow component (baseflow) and increase in the fast components (surface and subsurface flow). since the fast components are subject to higher variability than the slow component, the annual streamflow variability is amplified. agricultural water use in this region also has changed the groundwater storage seasonal regime from the pattern of ""summer recharge and winter discharge"" in the past to ""summer discharge and winter recharge"" at present. this challenges the existing groundwater modeling, which usually assumes fixed recharge pattern and rates."
Zeng et al.,2018,Environmental Research,"identifying key factors of the seawater intrusion mod& of dagu river basin, jiaozhou bay","seawater intrusion is a complex groundwater   seawater interaction process, and it is influenced by many factors from ground surface to underground, from groundwater to seawater. generally, for seawater intrusion model, some model parameters and boundarycondition are always specified by model users' personal experiences or literature's reference value. the defective model would damage the groundwater management for controlling and preventing seawater intrusion when making decisions are based on this model. in order to improve the reliability of seawater intrusion model, the influences of model inputs on output should be identified prior at optimizing model inputs. dagu river basin, jiaozhou bay is one of the most serious areas of seawater intrusion in china, and it is chosen as the study area in this study. the seawater intrusion model of dagu river basin is built based on a general program seawat4. the key influence factors of model output are analyzed by two sensitivityanalysis methods, i.e., stepwise regression and mutual entropy. the results demonstrated that the most important influence factors which have largest sensitivities to groundwater cl   concentration are the precipitation rate and groundwater pumping in agriculture area. in addition, the hydraulic conductivity of zone 1 has a non negligible influence on seawater intrusion process. stepwise regression analysis is capable of identifying most important influence factor, and it can't handle complicated nonlinear input output relationship. mutual entropy analysis is reliable for identifying the influence factors for complex seawater intrusion model."
Zeng et al.,2016,Environmental Research,assessing the pollution risk of a groundwater source field at western laizhou bay under seawater intrusion,"coastal areas have great significance for human living, economy and society development in the world. with the rapid increase of pressures from human activities and climate change, the safety of groundwater resource is under the threat of seawater intrusion in coastal areas. the area of laizhou bay is one of the most serious seawater intruded areas in china, since seawater intrusion phenomenon was firstly recognized in the middle of 1970s. this study assessed the pollution risk of a groundwater source filed of western laizhou bay area by inferring the probability distribution of groundwater cl  concentration. the numerical model of seawater intrusion process is built by using seawat4. the parameter uncertainty of this model is evaluated by markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) simulation, and dream((zs)) is used as sampling algorithm. then, the predictive distribution of cl  concentration at groundwater source field is inferred by using the samples of model parameters obtained from mcmc. after that, the pollution risk of groundwater source filed is assessed by the predictive quantiles of cl  concentration. the results of model calibration and verification demonstrate that the dream((zs)) based mcmc is efficient and reliable to estimate model parameters under current observation. under the condition of 95% confidence level, the groundwater source point will not be polluted by seawater intrusion in future five years (2015 2019). in addition, the 2.5% and 97.5% predictive quantiles show that the cl  concentration of groundwater source field always vary between 175 mg/l and 200 mg/l.

Zeng et al.,2017,Journal of Climate,hydrologic and climatic responses to global anthropogenic groundwater extraction,"in this study, a groundwater (gw) extraction scheme was incorporated into the community earth system model, version 1.2.0 (cesm1.2.0), to create a new version called cesm1.2_gw, which was used to investigate hydrologic and climatic responses to anthropogenic gw extraction on a global scale. an ensemble of 41 yr simulations with and without gw extraction (estimated based on local water supply and demand) was conducted and analyzed. the results revealed that gw extraction and water consumption caused drying in deep soil layers but wetting in upper layers, along with a rapidly declining gw table in areas with the most severe gw extraction, including the central united states, the north china plain, and northern india and pakistan. the atmosphere also responded to gw extraction, with cooling at the 850 hpa level over northern india and pakistan and a large area in northern china and central russia. increased precipitation occurred in the north china plain due to increased evapotranspiration from irrigation. decreased precipitation occurred in northern india because the indian monsoon and its transport of water vapor were weaker as a result of cooling induced by gw use. additionally, the background climate change may complicate the precipitation responses to the gw use. local terrestrial water storage was shown to be unsustainable at the current high gw extraction rate. thus, a balance between reduced gw withdrawal and rapid economic development must be achieved in order to maintain a sustainable gw resource, especially in regions where gw is being overexploited."
Zeng et al.,2012,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,assessing water footprint at river basin level: a case study for the heihe river basin in northwest china,"increasing water scarcity places considerable importance on the quantification of water footprint (wf) at different levels. despite progress made previously, there are still very few wf studies focusing on specific river basins, especially for those in arid and semi arid regions. the aim of this study is to quantify wf within the heihe river basin (hrb), a basin located in the arid and semi arid northwest of china. the findings show that the wf was 1768 million m(3) yr( 1) in the hrb over 2004 2006. agricultural production was the largest water consumer, accounting for 96% of the wf (92% for crop production and 4% for livestock production). the remaining 4% was for the industrial and domestic sectors. the ""blue"" (surface and groundwater) component of wf was 811 million m(3) yr( 1). this indicates a blue water proportion of 46%, which is much higher than the world average and china's average, which is mainly due to the aridness of the hrb and a high dependence on irrigation for crop production. however, even in such a river basin, blue wf was still smaller than ""green"" (soil water) wf, indicating the importance of green water. we find that blue wf exceeded blue water availability during eight months per year and also on an annual basis. this indicates that wf of human activities was achieved at a cost of violating environmental flows of natural freshwater ecosystems, and such a wf pattern is not sustainable. considering the large wf of crop production, optimizing the crop planting pattern is often a key to achieving more sustainable water use in arid and semi arid regions."
Zhang et al.,2017,Water,"surrogate models for sub region groundwater management in the beijing plain, china","overexploitation of groundwater resources has caused groundwater related problems all over the world. effective groundwater governance is a favorable guarantee for its protection and sustainable utilization. accurate prediction of groundwater level (gwl) or depth to groundwater (gwd) plays an important role in groundwater resource management. due to the limitations and complexity of numerical models, this study aims to develop surrogate models that can dually control the gwl (or gwd) and groundwater quantity (gwq) in each district of the beijing plain, china, using the methods of multiple linear regression (mlr) and back propagation artificial neural network (bp ann). this study used 180 monthly gwd data records, including the first 168 data records for model development (training) and the remaining 12 data records for model verification. the results indicate that the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (nse) and correlation coefficient (r) for both the mlr and bp ann models are high in most districts and that the mlr models are more appropriate in this study. fifteen scenarios under different conditions of groundwater use and precipitation are designed to demonstrate the applicability of the developed model in groundwater management. the surrogate models are effective tools that can be used by decision makers for groundwater management."
Zhang et al.,2011,Journal of Hydrology,evapotranspiration and its partitioning in an irrigated winter wheat field: a combined isotopic and micrometeorologic approach,"groundwater overdraft threatens the future of irrigated agriculture in the north china plain. because irrigated winter wheat is the dominant user of extracted groundwater, improved understanding of water cycling through the soil plant atmosphere continuum during wheat cultivation in the north china plain is necessary for improving the sustainable utilization of limited water resources and promoting food security. in this paper, a combination of micrometeorological and stable isotope techniques was used to investigate evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics in a typical winter wheat agro ecosystem (luancheng agro ecosystem experiment station, hebei province). stable isotope mixing models were used with eddy covariance evapotranspiration estimates and micro lysimeter evaporation measurements to partition evapotranspiration and determine temporal variability of root water uptake depths. results suggest that evaporation during the winter wheat irrigation season can reach up to 30% of the total water consumption (almost two typical irrigations). the main depths of root water uptake were 0 40 cm. therefore, it is suggested that the planned irrigation wetting depth can be reduced at least to 40 cm, rather than the traditional 100 cm, as a means of water conservation. widespread implementation of these practices could amount to a significant water savings for the north china plain.

Zhang et al.,2011,Ground Water,factors governing sustainable groundwater pumping near a river,"the objective of this paper was to provide new insights into processes affecting riverbank filtration (rbf). we consider a system with an inflatable dam installed for enhancing water production from downstream collector wells. using a numerical model, we investigate the impact of groundwater pumping and dam operation on the hydrodynamics in the aquifer and water production. we focus our study on two processes that potentially limit water production of an rbf system: the development of an unsaturated zone and riverbed clogging. we quantify river clogging by calibrating a time dependent riverbed permeability function based on knowledge of pumping rate, river stage, and temperature. the dynamics of the estimated riverbed permeability reflects clogging and scouring mechanisms. our results indicate that (1) riverbed permeability is the dominant factor affecting infiltration needed for sustainable rbf production; (2) dam operation can influence pumping efficiency and prevent the development of an unsaturated zone beneath the riverbed only under conditions of sufficient riverbed permeability; (3) slow river velocity, caused by dam raising during summer months, may lead to sedimentation and deposition of fine grained material within the riverbed, which may clog the riverbed, limiting recharge to the collector wells and contributing to the development of an unsaturated zone beneath the riverbed; and (4) higher river flow velocities, caused by dam lowering during winter storms, scour the riverbed and thus increase its permeability. these insights can be used as the basis for developing sustainable water management of a rbf system."
Zhang et al.,2013,Water,long term evolution of cones of depression in shallow aquifers in the north china plain,"the north china plain (ncp) is one of the places where the groundwater is most over exploited in the world. currently, our understanding on the spatiotemporal variability of the cones of depression in this region is fragmentary. this study intends to simulate the cones of depression in the shallow aquifer across the entire ncp during the whole period from 1960 to 2011. during the simulation, the dominant role of anthropogenic activities is emphasized and carefully taken into account using a neural network algorithm. the results show that cones of depression in the ncp were formed in 1970s and continuously expanded. their centers were getting deeper with an increasing degree of groundwater exploitation. this simulation provides valuable insights for developing more sustainable groundwater management options after the implementation of the south to northwater diversion project (snwdp), which is a very important surfacewater project in china in the near future. the numerical model in this paper is built by modflow, with pumpage data completed by neural network algorithm and hydrogeological parameters calibrated by simulated annealing algorithm. based on our long term numerical model for regional groundwater flow in the ncp, one exploitation limitation strategy after the implementation of snwdp is studied in this paper. the results indicate that the snwdp is beneficial for groundwater recovery in the ncp. a number of immense groundwater cones will gradually shrink. however, the recovery of the groundwater environment in the ncp will require a long time."
Zhang et al.,2018,Water,"a new perspective to explore the hydraulic connectivity of karst aquifer system in jinan spring catchment, china","investigating the hydraulic connectivity of a complex karst aquifer system is an important research topic for sustainable operation and optimization layout of karst groundwater exploitation and recharge. however, the identification of preferential sites of recharge and exploitation is usually subject to regional hydrogeology conditions and the mechanisms of recharge and exploitation. the conventional research methods of hydraulic connectivity often have some limitations. in this study, we developed an improved grey amplitude relation model to explore the hydraulic connectivity in jinan spring catchment and presented a quantized evaluation index watertable fluctuation relation degree (wtfrd) using karst groundwatertable data in western jinan and jinan spring groups from 2014 to 2017. results showed that the total wtfrd was 0.854 between western jinan and jinan spring groups when the external distraction for karst groundwatertable was the smallest, which was in high relation degree grade. meanwhile, the change rules of karst groundwatertable in the two sites were basically the same. accordingly, a high connectivity occurred between the two karst aquifers from a statistical perspective, and further illustrated thatwestern jinan could be selected as preferential experiment sites. a comprehensive case in jinan spring catchment indicated that the wtfrd provided a preliminary idea to investigate hydraulic connectivity quantitatively. this method could be considered as a pre study of the conventional experiments to form a high efficiency and low cost combined method, which has great potential and merits further study."
Zhang et al.,2014,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,groundwater dynamics under water saving irrigation and implications for sustainable water management in an oasis: tarim river basin of western china,"water is essential for life. specifically in the oases of inland arid basins, water is a critically limited resource, essential for the development of the socio economy and the sustainability of eco environmental systems. due to the unique hydrological regime present in arid oases, a moderate groundwatertable is the goal of sustainable water management. a shallow watertable induces serious secondary salinization and collapse of agriculture, while a deep watertable causes deterioration of natural vegetation. from the hydrological perspective, the exchange flux between the unsaturated vadose zone and groundwater reservoir is a critical link to understanding regional watertable dynamics. this flux is substantially influenced by anthropogenic activities. in the tarim river basin of western china, where agriculture consumes over 90% of available water resources, the exchange flux between the unsaturated vadose zone and groundwater reservoir is influenced strongly by irrigation. recently, mulched drip irrigation, a sophisticated water saving irrigation method, was widely applied in the tarim river basin, which greatly impacted the exchange flux and thus the regional groundwater dynamics. capitalizing on recent progress in evaporation measurement techniques, we can now close the waterbalance and directly quantify the exchange flux at the field scale, thus gaining a better understanding of regional groundwater dynamics. in this study, comprehensive observations of waterbalance components in an irrigated cropland were implemented in 2012 and 2013 in a typical oasis within the tarim river basin. the waterbalance analysis showed that the exchange flux and groundwater dynamics were significantly altered by the application of water saving irrigation. the exchange flux at the groundwatertable is mostly downward (310.5 mm year( 1)), especially during drip irrigation period and spring flush period, while the upward flux is trivial (16.1 mm year( 1)) due to the moderate groundwatertable depth (annual average depth 2.9 m). traditional secondary salinization caused by intense phreatic evaporation (fed by upward exchange flux) is alleviated. however, a new form of secondary salinization may be introduced unwittingly if there is lack of water for periodic flushing, especially when brackish water is used in the irrigation. furthermore, the water saved via drip irrigation has been used in further growth of irrigated lands instead of supporting the ecological system. this could lead to an increased risk of eco environmental degradation and calls for improved governance schemes. the insights gained from this study can be potentially applied to other arid inland areas (e.g., central asia) which face similar water shortages and human development problems."

Zhu et al.,2013,Water Resources Management,"management strategy of groundwater resources and recovery of over extraction drawdown funnel in huaibei city, china","groundwater overexploitation is threatening our ecosystems and even the life of future generations. once happens, elimination of the bad influence will be a long term process. it should be a feasible approach to take the environmental recovery as a whole by the way of the groundwater management. a case study of water resources management in huaibei city, within semiarid region of north anhui province, china, was illustrated, especially on the issues of groundwater over extraction drawdown funnel recovery. taking into account the water demand for satisfying the urban development in the next 15 years, three target years of water resources planning were postulated as the present (2005), the short term (2010) and the long term (2020), respectively. four hydrological years: wet year, mean year, dry year and extremely dry year, were also defined by the rainfall data for many years. a groundwater management model which could deal with twelve possible scenarios (3 target years of water resources planning x4 hydrological years) was established based on simulation and optimization. the groundwater management model could optimize the strategies of water resources development, integrate various kinds of water sources, e.g. groundwater, surfacewater and additive water sources, and meet the water demand for the urban development within an area of huaibei city. importantly, in accordance with the groundwater management model solutions, the issues of groundwater over extraction drawdown funnel, which has formed within the huaibei downtown area for many years and lead to some environmental and social problems, would be solved over the whole planning period."
Zhu et al.,2014,Environmental Earth Sciences,aquifer system incremental linear property and its application on groundwater management,"generally, an aquifer system coupled into a groundwater management model was regarded as a linear system. however, in terms of systems analysis, the aquifer system can be proven to be an incremental linear system rather than a linear system. for example, a confined aquifer system can be decomposed into two parts, one of which is a linear time invariability sub system and another is a zero input response. this system does not meet the additivity property of linear system, but satisfies the incremental linear system characteristics. in order to better understand, a case study of water resources management of huaibei city within semiarid region, north anhui province of china, is cited. taking into account the water demand for satisfying the urban development in the next 15 years, three planning target years of water resources are preset as the present (2005), the short term (2010) and the long term (2020), respectively, and four hydrological years (e.g., wet year, mean year, dry year, and extremely dry year) are also defined by the rainfall data of many years. a groundwater management model based on linear programming is established. this model can deal with 12 possible scenarios (3 target years x 4 hydrological years), optimize the strategies of water resources development, integrate various kinds of water sources (e.g., groundwater, surfacewater and additional water) and meet the water demand for the urban development of huaibei city. in accordance with the groundwater management model solutions, the problem of groundwater drawdown funnels (groundwater overextraction funnels) which formed within the huaibei downtown area for many years and led to some environmental and social issues will be solved over the whole planning period. more importantly, through statistically analyzing the model solutions, the relationships between the groundwater pumping (input signals) and groundwater level recovery (output signals) show up the characteristics of the incremental linear system."
Zhuang et al.,2017,Rock and Soil Mechanics,a method for estimating aquitard parameters using long term monitoring data,"aquitards are an important part of an aquifer system. hydraulic properties of an aquitard, such as hydraulic conductivity and specific storage must be determined before the investigation of strata deformation and groundwater depletion. based on the proposed one dimensional schematic diagram of an aquifer system, a dimensionless analytical solution for flow in the aquitard is derived under the boundarycondition of drawdown in adjacent aquifers showing a linear increase with time. the dissipation process of time lag drawdown in the aquitard is analyzed. the type curve of cumulative aquitard compaction versus time is derived based on the mass balance equation of water. a new type curve method is further derived for estimating the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of the aquitard. the type curve method reflects the time lag drainage within the aquitard. this method is tested by a field application to the shanghai aquifer system to obtain the hydraulic parameters of the second aquitard at the f(10 7) extensometer site. field test results show that the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage are 4.26x10( 10) m/s and 2.22x10( 4) m( 1), respectively. for an aquifer system with long term observed water level and deformation data, the new type curve method can be used to some extent."
Zonderland-Thomassen et al.,2012,Agricultural Systems,water footprinting   a comparison of methods using new zealand dairy farming as a case study,"a case study is presented to (1) assess the water footprint of new zealand (nz) dairy farming in two contrasting regions of waikato (north island, non irrigated moderate rainfall) and canterbury (south island, irrigated low rainfall), (2) illustrate differences in water footprint methods and (3) evaluate the suitability of indicators derived from each water footprint method. the water footprint methods (1) water footprint following the water footprint network (wf (wfn)), (2) stress weighted water footprint (wf (ridoutt)), following ridoutt and pfister (2010) and ridoutt et al. (2010), (3) environmental impacts of freshwater consumption expressed in damage to resources (delta r), damage to ecosystem quality (delta eq), and damage to human health (delta hh) following pfister et al. (2009), and (4) freshwater ecosystem impacts (feis) and freshwater depletion (fd) following mila i canals et al. (2009, 2010) were applied to two average dairy systems in the different regions. total wf (wfn) was 945 and 1084 l h2o/kg fat and protein corrected milk (fpcm) for the average waikato and canterbury dairy farm systems, respectively. the waikato farm system had a higher green wf (wfn),whereas the canterbury farm system had the highest blue wf (wfn) impact, grey wf (wfn), wf (ridoutt), delta eq fei, and fd mostly due to groundwater and surfacewater used for irrigation of pasture. for both dairy farm systems, delta r and delta hh were zero. data collection in the inventory showed similarities between the water footprint methods. the methods, however, all resulted in different total estimates due to (1) the inclusion of how land conversion from native vegetation to agriculture affects freshwater availability in fei, (2) application of different characterisation factors, and (3) inclusion of a normalisation procedure for wf (ridoutt). for example, wfc (ridoutt) was 0.011 l h2o equivalents (eq)/kg fpcm for waikato and 7.1 l h2o eq/kg fpcm for canterbury dairy farm systems whereas corresponding values for fei were  1.8 l ecosystem eq h2o/kg fpcm and 14.6 l ecosystem eq h2o/kg fpcm respectively. use of catchment specific characterisation factors are preferred over characterisation factors based on globally spatial data for wf studies. for fd, we recommend incorporating the concept of sustainable yield for aquifers into the characterisation factor. summing the different coloured waters into one wf (wfn) reduces the relevance and indicators related to regional water scarcity have more meaning for end users compared to volumetric estimates. the blue wf (wfn) impact, wf (ridoutt), and fei are all useful indicators but only relate to freshwater availability. in respect to dairy farming, these indicators should be complemented by fd and delta r and other impact categories which assess water degradation impacts on ecosystems and human health while avoiding double counting: e.g., delta eq delta hh, and grey wf (wfn) impact or eutrophication potential (ep).

Zou et al.,2015,Journal of Hydrology,"effects of anthropogenic groundwater exploitation on land surface processes: a case study of the haihe river basin, northern china","in this study, we incorporated a groundwater exploitation scheme into the land surface model clm3.5 to investigate the effects of the anthropogenic exploitation of groundwater on land surface processes in a river basin. simulations of the haihe river basin in northern china were conducted for the years 1965 .2000 using the model. a control simulation without exploitation and three exploitation simulations with different water demands derived from socioeconomic data related to the basin were conducted. the results showed that groundwater exploitation for human activities resulted in increased wetting and cooling effects at the land surface and reduced groundwater storage. a lowering of the groundwatertable, increased upper soil moisture, reduced 2 m air temperature, and enhanced latent heat flux were detected by the end of the simulated period, and the changes at the land surface were related linearly to the water demands. to determine the possible responses of the land surface processes in extreme cases (i.e., in which the exploitation process either continued or ceased), additional hypothetical simulations for the coming 200 years with constant climate forcing were conducted, regardless of changes in climate. the simulations revealed that the local groundwater storage on the plains could not contend with high intensity exploitation for long if the exploitation process continues at the current rate. changes attributable to groundwater exploitation reached extreme values and then weakened within decades with the depletion of groundwater resources and the exploitation process will therefore cease. however, if exploitation is stopped completely to allow groundwater to recover, drying and warming effects, such as increased temperature, reduced soil moisture, and reduced total runoff, would occur in the basin within the early decades of the simulation period. the effects of exploitation will then gradually disappear, and the variables will approach the natural state and stabilize at different rates. simulations were also conducted for cases in which exploitation either continues or ceases using future climate scenario outputs from a general circulation model. the resulting trends were almost the same as those of the simulations with constant climate forcing, despite differences in the climate data input. therefore, a balance between slow groundwater restoration and rapid human development of the land must be achieved to maintain a sustainable water resource.

Zyoud et al.,2017,Applied Water Science,estimates of arab world research productivity associated with groundwater: a bibliometric analysis,"the sustainable management of groundwater resources is a pressing necessity for most countries. as most of the arab world is facing severe water scarcity, threats of depletion of non renewable groundwater, and problems of pollution and salt water intrusions into groundwater aquifers, much effort should be devoted to eliminate these dangers in advance. this work was devoted to bring up insights into arab world research activities in groundwater, which is a crucial task to identify their status and can help in shaping up and improving future research activities. a bibliometric analysis has been conducted to track these activities. the study identified 1417 documents which represent 3.3% of global research productivity. egypt was the most productive country (313; 22.1%), followed by saudi arabia (254; 17.9%). total citations were 9720 with an average of 6.9. the h index of the retrieved documents was 39, and the highest one was 22 for egypt. the most common subject category was environmental science, and the most productive journal was arabian journal of geosciences (99; 7.0%). in international research collaboration, france was the most collaborated country with arab world (125; 8.8%), followed by the united states (113; 8.0%). the most productive institution was king abdul aziz university, saudi arabia (66; 4.7%). the outcomes shows remarkable improvements in groundwater research activities originated from the arab world. even though, constructive efforts should be pursued vigorously to bridge the gaps in groundwater based research. moreover, promotion of better evaluation tools to assess the risks arising from the mismanagement of groundwater resources is required urgently."
