Chen et al.,2019,Water,"hydrogeochemical characteristics and quality assessment of groundwater in an irrigated region, northwest china","groundwater is one of the most important sources of water for drinking and irrigation in arid and semi arid regions of the world. in this study, 50 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for various chemical constituents (ph, tds, na+, k+, ca2+, mg2+, so42 , cl , hco3 , no3 , and f ) to identify the hydrogeochemical characteristics, and to evaluate its suitability for drinking and irrigation uses in zhongning area of northwest china. results showed that groundwater was slightly alkaline in nature. fluoride and nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of the study region were much higher than its prescribed limits for drinking purposes. a factor analysis (fa) was implemented to understand the contamination source of groundwater in the region, and the results indicated that rock water interaction, geogenic, and human induced contamination were the major factors influencing groundwater chemistry. an entropy weighted water quality index (ewqi) was employed to evaluate the water quality for drinking purpose. mg2+, ca2+, so42 , hco3 , and tds played the leading roles in influencing the groundwater quality with high weights. forty eight percent of groundwater samples were unfit for drinking purpose in the study area, due to poor quality. elevated concentrations of so42 , cl  and no3  n in groundwater caused poor quality and extremely poor quality water, which may be attributed to human activities. according to the calculation of sodium percentage (na%), sodium adsorption ration (sar), and permeability index (pi), the majority of the groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation. however, it should be noted that 26% of the samples were unfit for irrigation because of the high salinity in the groundwater. this is mainly attributed to the intense evaporation and the intensified irrigation activities in the region. the findings in this study contribute to a better understanding of groundwater sustainability for supporting water management and protection in the future.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
Zaki et al.,2019,Geosciences Journal,"chemical characteristics and assessment of groundwater quality in halayieb area, southeastern part of the eastern desert, egypt","halayieb area is located at the southeastern corner on the border between egypt and sudan. the area has very important strategic aspects to egypt. groundwater is the only source of fresh water in the area. the hydrogeochemical characterizations of groundwater in the area were carried out, to assess the quality of groundwater for its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes. geologically the precambrian rocks underlain the mesozoic sandstone and tertiary marine sediments. the groundwater of the area is recorded at the miocene sedimentary succession and the fractured basement aquifers with a maximum water depth of 26.5 m from the ground surface. groundwater quality is mostly saline caused by the sources of geogenic, anthropogenic, and marine origin of the water bearing formations. the resulting groundwater is characterized by na+ > ca2+ > mg2+/cl  > hco3  > so42 : na+ > ca2+ > k+/so42  > cl  > hco3  facies, following the topographical and water flow path conditions. the hydrochemical facies in this area fall in the field of nacl type and the hydrogeochemical signatures indicated active hydrolysis and dissolution process of ca bearing minerals of the basement rocks and some sodium is lost, most probably through reverse ion exchange. enrichment of mn+ in some wells is regarded to the mining activity for manganese ores in the area. groundwater quality is mostly not suitable for drinking purposes. for irrigation, the groundwater is mostly suitable in regard to the residual sodium carbonate and the magnesium hazard. according to the water quality assessment using united states salinity laboratory (usll) diagram, most water samples located in category c3 s2, c3 s3, c3 s4, c4 s2 highlighting high to very high salinity hazard and medium to very high sodium content class. most of the groundwater samples that are located away from the shoreline are suitable for livestock and poultry consumption. high salinity contents in the study area create severe problems for using water supplies and for future exploitation.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Noorellimia et al.,2019,Arabian Journal of Geosciences,geoelectrical parameters for the estimation of hydrogeological properties,"excessive groundwater extraction could cause environmental degradation such as surfacewater depletion, saltwater intrusion, and many more. therefore, groundwater should be extracted in sustainable way to avert the harmful consequences. an accurate amount of sustainable groundwater yield can be obtained through the groundwater flow model that has low uncertainty. it is important to incorporate the actual hydrogeological properties into groundwater flow modeling to reduce the uncertainty. the purpose of this study is to estimate hydrogeological properties, namely, hydraulic conductivity (k) and transmissivity (t), by combining the electrical resistivity (er) and induced polarization (ip) methods into an analytical equation. this study used an analytical equation that relates the geoelectrical parameters to the hydrogeological properties. the er and ip methods were applied to improve the accuracy of geoelectrical parameters using the abem lund imaging system. the developed analytical equation was compared with other studies for verification. the results showed that the analytical equation model developed in this study had the lowest error compared to that of other published analytical equation models. therefore, the combination of the er and ip methods with a new proposed constant value for the analytical equation increased the accuracy of hydrogeological properties.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
Oiro et al.,2019,Journal of African Earth Sciences,"drivers, patterns and velocity of saltwater intrusion in a stressed aquifer of the east african coast: joint analysis of groundwater and geophysical data in southern kenya","fresh groundwater resources in coastal east africa are crucial for the region's socio economic development but are under threat of salinization caused by changes in recharge patterns and increasing abstraction. with the aim of establishing the drivers behind saltwater intrusion and its current spatial extent, we studied the kenyan south coast aquifer, a representative, strategic aquifer under increased pressure. investigations included electrical resistivity tomography (ert) surveys and in situ groundwater measurements (watertable and basic quality) together with the analysis of available long term climatic and borehole monitoring data. over the last 40 years, groundwater electrical conductivity values at the well field increased by about three times and groundwater levels declined by 1 3 m over the last decade. when put in perspective with the long term climate (rainfall, temperature) and abstraction records, these trends in groundwater appear to be primarily driven by increased borehole abstraction (+ 400 m(3)/day per year in average), whereas observed increasing temperature (+ 0.02 degrees c per year) and decreasing rainfall (  0.8 mm per year) could potentially act as a secondary control through reduced recharge. however the low statistical significance obtained for both rainfall and temperature trends over the observation period suggests that no clear conclusion can be made with regards to long term climate impact on groundwater. groundwater quality mapping showed that proximity to the ocean, presence of abstraction well fields and regional geology control groundwater salinity patterns at regional scale. locally, geophysical data showed that, saltwater intrusion spatial patterns are controlled by local aquifer lithology, groundwater abstraction and freshwater recharge in floodplains. comparison with previous (1984) resistivity data showed that the saltwater front has advanced toward the well field by up to 2 km and rose by up to 80 m over the last 30 years, which corresponds to a maximal velocity of about 60 m/y horizontally and 2 m/y vertically. implementation of groundwater management strategies such as sustainable groundwater exploitation, sourced alternative water supply, and managed aquifer recharge are required to mitigate the effects of seawater intrusion along the east african coastal strip.",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

Kurylyk et al.,2019,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews-Water,"theory, tools, and multidisciplinary applications for tracing groundwater fluxes from temperature profiles","quantifying groundwater fluxes to and from deep aquifers or shallow sediment is a critical task faced by researchers and practitioners from many environmental science disciplines including hydrology, hydrogeology, ecology, climatology, and oceanography. groundwater discharge to inland and coastal water bodies influences their waterbudgets, thermal regimes, and biogeochemistry. conversely, downward water flow from the land surface or from surfacewater bodies to underlying aquifers represents an important water flux that must be quantified for sustainable groundwater management. because these vertical subsurface flows are slow and typically diffuse, they cannot be measured directly and must rather be estimated using groundwater tracers. heat is a naturally occurring groundwater tracer that is ubiquitous in the subsurface and readily measured. most of the academic literature has focused on groundwater temperature tracing methods capitalizing on the propagation of diel temperature sine waves into sediment beneath surfacewater bodies. such methods rely on temperature time series to infer groundwater fluxes and are typically only viable in the shallow subsurface and in locations with focused groundwater fluxes. alternative methods that utilize temperature depth profiles are applicable across a broader range of hydrologic environments, and point in time measurements can be quickly taken to cover larger spatial scales. applications of these methods have been impeded due in part to the lack of understanding regarding their potential applications and limitations. herein, we highlight relevant theory, thermal data collection techniques, and recent diverse field applications to stimulate further multidisciplinary uptake of thermal groundwater tracing methods that rely on temperature depth profiles. this article is categorized under: water and life > methods science of water > methods water and life > nature of freshwater ecosystems",1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1

Moqbel et al.,2018,Jordan Journal of Civil Engineering,modeling groundwater flow and solute transport at azraq basin using parflow and slim fast,"azraq basin, being one of the largest basins in jordan and a viable drinking water resource, witnessed a dramatic increase in water demand over the past four decades. this led to an over abstraction from this aquifer, which in turn resulted in deterioration of its water quality. to better manage and sustain this and other aquifers, new elaborate computer codes, called parflow and slim fast, have been used to simulate groundwater flow and contaminants' transport at azraq basin. parflow is a portable and parallel processing simulator, designed for modeling multi phase fluid flow in 3d heterogeneous porous media. this code possesses a local mesh refinement capability, uses site topography and subterranean formations and offers a variety of numerical methods for various aspects of numerical simulation, while slim fast uses the random walk method to solve sub surface transport problems of multi phase, multi constituent contaminant mixture. slim fast was written specifically to exploit a quasi analytical formulation to find a rapid solution for the advection transport. these codes provided means to predict the hydraulic head in the upper and middle aquifers, simulate the movement of total dissolved solids (tdss) in the upper aquifer and estimate the age of groundwater. results from groundwater model showed that steady state drawdown at points of observation may reach 28 m, which exceeds the 15.3 m drawdown previously predicted by other formal studies. contaminant transport model results indicated that the concentration of total dissolved solids is expected to increase slowly in the basin due to the movement of high salinity water toward the pumping wells used for domestic purposes. estimated values of groundwater age varied between 3000 and more than 50,000 years based on the flowdirection.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Perri et al.,2018,Water Resources Research,plant osmoregulation as an emergent water saving adaptation,"soil salinity affects plant transpiration and growth through two main pathways: the osmotic effect of salt in the soil (osmotic stress; analogous to water stress) and the toxic effect of salt within the plant (ionic stress; salt specific). however, the drastic and sudden reduction of transpiration exhibited by most species in response to an increase of salinity in the root zone is mainly associated with the osmotic phase, while ionic stress appears at a later time, causing the premature senescence of leaves and the reduction of the plant photosynthetic area. to better investigate the effects of salinity on plant water relations, we introduce a parsimonious soil plant atmosphere continuum (spac) model accounting for both salt exclusion at the root level and osmoregulation i.e.,the adjustment of internal water potential in response to salt stress. the model is used to interpret a paradox observed in salt tolerant species where transpiration is maximum at an intermediate value of salinity (c tr,c max), and is lower in more fresh (c < c tr,c max) and more saline (c > c tr,c max) conditions. such nonmonotonic transpiration salt concentration (t r c) patterns can be largely explained by plant osmoregulation, while the peak of transpiration at c tr,c  max tends to disappear over longer time scales, when ionic stress appears and morphological adaptations become predominant. osmoregulation emerges here as a water saving behavior similar to the strategies that xerophytes use to cope with aridity. the maximum of transpiration at c tr,c  max is thus the result of a trade off between the enhancement of salt tolerance and optimal carbon assimilation. plain language summary soil salinization represents a major threat for the food security and sustainable development of drylands, with salt affected soils presently covering more than 9 billion ha worldwide expected to further increase due to climate change, landuse modifications and erroneous irrigation/groundwater abstraction practices. despite this fact, the effects of salinity on the rate at which plants transpire and grow in salt affected soils are rarely considered in ecological and ecohydrological models, and the different processes leading to salt tolerance are yet poorly understood. here, we introduce a simple model of how salt tolerant species adapt to elevated salt concentrations in the soil, and of how such adaptations substantially lead to plant osmoregulation, as an emergent water saving behavior similar to the strategies that aridity tolerant species (xerophytes) use to cope with extreme water scarcity. the bottom line is that salt tolerant plants experience salt stress as an alternative form of water limitation, and developed both short and long term adaptations accordingly. our findings are instrumental to a better comprehension of the interplay between soil salinization, salt tolerance and efficient water use that is, in turn, the key to understand the potential of salt tolerant crops and contrast soil salinization.",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1

Nakaya et al.,2018,Hydrological Processes,hydrochemical behaviour of an underground dammed limestone aquifer in the subtropics,"in an island area with limited surfacewater resources, the conservation of fresh groundwater resources is important for the maintenance of the water supply and irrigation system to be used in agricultural activity. in a limestone aquifer used for irrigation on a subtropical island, the progress of the dissolution behaviour of the aquifer and the effects of co2 storage and chemical weathering of the aquifer must be understood to ensure sustainable groundwater use. in this study, hydrochemical behaviour of the ryukyu limestone aquifer was investigated using the residence time of slowly flowing groundwater, which is contained by a 2.3 km long underground man made dam constructed in 2005 located at the southern edge of okinawa island, japan. groundwater dating and horizontal flow velocity measurements indicate that the groundwater horizontal flow is slow in the underground dam area, whereas the saturation index (si) for calcite indicates that the majority of the limestone exists in a supersaturated condition. the range of si for gypsum was indicative of subsaturation, and the si increased with the groundwater residence time, suggesting that the dissolution of caso4 tends to proceed slowly through the common ion effect. the dissolution of caco3, however, tends to be in suspension within about a residence time of 20 years. the apparent dissolution rate of ca in the ryukyu limestone aquifer in this area was estimated to be approximately 2.70 4.06 nmol cm( 2) year( 1), a value much lower than that of the early stages of the limestone dissolution. the estimated groundwater co2 (gas) concentrations are two order high (about 0.3 7%) relative to atmospheric co2 (about 0.04%), and the groundwater ph shows a tendency to decrease from 7.4 to 6.9 over the last approximately 20 years, indicating that the hydration reaction of co2 occurs in the ryukyu limestone aquifer. these findings imply that high co2 produced in the subtropical zone is consumed slower than co2 production during limestone dissolution, with the exclusion of the early stage of the chemical weathering process, and causes groundwater acidification in the underground dammed limestone aquifer.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
Cox et al.,2018,Applied Geochemistry,soil quality changes due to flood irrigation in agricultural fields along the rio grande in western texas,"growing populations demand more food, putting more pressure on soil productivity and sustainability around the world. in western texas along the rio grande valley, the low natural rainfall requires frequent irrigations for sustaining agriculture. to investigate the impacts of irrigation on soil quality, we collected and modelled geochemical data (major elements and nutrients) on irrigation water, soil pore water, drainage water, and soil samples, and monitored soil moisture, temperature, and electrical conductivity with sensors from two pecan, one cotton, and one alfalfa fields in western texas. this study showed that flood irrigation with both surface (rio grande river) and groundwaters significantly increased the root zone salinity, soil sodicity, and nutrient leaching from soils to the underlying aquifers and rio grande river from agricultural fields of the arid southwest. the water used for irrigation was high in total dissolved solids (> 500 ppm generally), dominated by na+, cl , ca2+ and so42 . after flood irrigation, infiltrating water dissolved salts such as gypsum that have accumulated in the soils due to previous irrigations, or/and mixed existing concentrated soil waters, and approached saturation with respect to these evaporite minerals. soil water was supersaturated with respect to carbonates as pedogenic calcite precipitated out and reached concentrations of similar to 10 wt% of total soil mass. this suggested that pedogenic carbonate is an important carbon reservoir and precipitation kinetics and controls of such secondary calcite need further investigation for the irrigated agricultural fields in arid regions of the world. chemistry of agricultural return flow samples collected from drainage ditches was similar to that of irrigation water, suggesting that most of the irrigation water had taken a shallow and short flowpath through the fields to drains. between irrigation events, soil water became more concentrated as water was lost through evapo transpiration that led to precipitation of evaporite salts. as a result, sodicity and salinity of soils, especially clayey soils, frequently exceeded the tolerance levels of major crops grown in the region. here in these fine textured soils, combination of high evapotranspiration rates, intensive irrigation with water of elevated salinity, and limited infiltration stunted crop growth, decreased soil porosity and permeability, led to poor aeration, and accelerated salt buildup via a positive feedback mechanism. during initial irrigation where soils were saturated, soil water also percolated and recharged to underlying aquifers, and thus salts, nutrients, and trace metals from agricultural practices (i.e., application of fertilizers, irrigation, soil amendments, and pesticide) could be mobilized to shallow groundwaters. this implied that chemistry of rio grande river, groundwater, and soil was closely linked. thus the sustainability of agriculture depended on appropriate water, soil and crop management practices.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Ganot et al.,2018,Water Resources Research,geochemical processes during managed aquifer recharge with desalinated seawater,"we study geochemical processes along the variably saturated zone during managed aquifer recharge (mar) with reverse osmosis desalinated seawater (dsw). the dsw, post treated at the desalination plant by calcite dissolution (remineralization) to meet the israeli water quality standards, is recharged into the israeli coastal aquifer through an infiltration pond. water quality monitoring during two mar events using suction cups and wells inside the pond indicates that cation exchange is the dominant subsurface reaction, driven by the high ca2+ concentration in the post treated dsw. stable isotope analysis shows that the shallow groundwater composition is similar to the recharged dsw, except for enrichment of mg2+, na+, ca2+, and hco3. a calibrated variably saturated reactive transport model is used to predict the geochemical evolution during 50 years of mar for two water quality scenarios: (i) post treated dsw (current practice) and (ii) soft dsw (lacking the remineralization post treatment process). the latter scenario was aimed to test soil aquifer treatment (sat) as an alternative post treatment technique. both scenarios provide an enrichment of similar to 2.5 mg l 1 in mg2+ due to cation exchange, compared to practically zero mg2+ currently found in the israeli dsw. simulations of the alternative sat scenario provide ca2+ and hco3 remineralization due to calcite dissolution at levels that meet the israeli standard for dsw. the simulated calcite content reduction in the sediments below the infiltration pond after 50 years of mar was low (<1%). our findings suggest that remineralization using sat for dsw is a potentially sustainable practice at mar sites overlying calcareous sandy aquifers.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Knight et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,the onshore influence of offshore fresh groundwater,"freshwater contained within the submarine extensions of coastal aquifers is increasingly proposed as a freshwater source for coastal communities. however, the extent to which offshore freshwater supports onshore pumping is currently unknown on a global scale. this study provides the first attempt to examine the likely prevalence of situations where offshore freshwater influences onshore salinities, considering various sites from around the world. the groundwater conditions in twenty seven confined and semi confined coastal aquifers with plausible connections to inferred or observed offshore freshwater are explored. the investigation uses available onshore salinities and groundwater levels, and offshore salinity knowledge, in combination with analytical modelling, to develop simplified conceptual models of the study sites. seven different conceptual models are proposed based on the freshwater saltwater extent and insights gained from analytical modelling. we consider both present day and pre development conditions in assessing potential modern contributions to offshore fresh groundwater. conceptual models also include interpretations of whether offshore freshwater is a significant factor influencing onshore salinities and well pumping sustainability. the results indicate that onshore water levels have declined between pre development and present day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions for which pre development data are available. estimates of the associated steady state freshwater extents show the potential for considerable offshore fresh groundwater losses accompanying these declines. both present day and pre development heads are insufficient to account for the observed offshore freshwater in all cases where adequate data exist. this suggests that paleo freshwater and/or aquifer heterogeneities contribute significantly to offshore freshwater extent. present day heads indicate that active seawater intrusion (swi) will eventually impact onshore pumping wells at fourteen of the twenty seven sites, while passive swi is expected onshore in an additional ten regions. albeit the number of field sites is limited, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that when offshore freshwater has an onshore linkage, it is being mined either passively or actively by onshore use. thus, offshore freshwater should be assessed in coastal waterbalances presuming that it serves as an existing freshwater input, rather than as a new potential freshwater resource.

Re et al.,2017,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,tackling the salinity pollution nexus in coastal aquifers from arid regions using nitrate and boron isotopes,"salinization and nitrate pollution are generally ascertained as the main issues affecting coastal aquifers worldwide. in arid zones, where agricultural activities also result in soil salinization, both phenomena tend to co exist and synergically contribute to alter groundwater quality, with severe negative impacts on human populations and natural ecosystems' wellbeing. it becomes therefore necessary to understand if and to what extent integrated hydrogeochemical tools can help in distinguishing among possible different salinization and nitrate contamination origins, in order to provide adequate science based support to local development and environmental protection. the alluvial plain of bou areg (north morocco) extends over about 190 km(2) and is separated from the mediterranean sea by the coastal lagoon of nador. its surface is covered for more than 60% by agricultural activities, although the region has been recently concerned by urban population increase and tourismexpansion. all these activities mainly rely on groundwater exploitation and at the same time are the main causes of both aquifer and lagoon water quality degradation. for this reason, it was chosen as a case study representative of the typical situation of coastal aquifers in arid zones worldwide, where a clear identification of salinization and pollution sources is fundamental for the implementation of locally oriented remedies and long term management strategies. results of a hydrogeochemical investigation performed between 2009 and 2011 show that the bou areg aquifer presents high salinity (often exceeding 100 mg/l in tds) due to both natural and anthropogenic processes. the area is also impacted by nitrate contamination, with concentrations generally exceeding the who statutory limits for drinking water (50 mg/l) and reaching up to about 300 mg/l, in both the rural and urban/peri urban areas. the isotopic composition of dissolved nitrates (delta n 15(no3) and delta o 18(no)) was used to constrain pollution drivers. the results indicate two main origins for human induced pollution: (i) manure and septic effluents, especially in urban areas, and (ii) synthetic fertilizers in agricultural areas. in the latter, delta n 15 enriched values highlight a mixture of those sources, possibly related to unbalanced fertilization and agricultural return flow. boron isotopes (delta b 11) were hence studied to further distinguish the nitrate origin in the presence of multiple sources and mixing processes. the results indicate that in the study area, the high geochemical background for b and cl, associated to the complex waterrock interaction processes, limit the application of the coupled delta b 11 and delta n 15 isotopic systematics to the detection of sources of groundwater pollution. in fact, despite the exceedingly high nitrate contents, the depleted delta b 11 values that characterize synthetic fertilizers and sewage leakages could not be detected. therefore, even if in saline groundwater the anthropogenic contribution has a negligible effect in terms of salinity input, with both sewage and irrigation water not very charged, the associated nitrate content fuels up water rock interaction processes, eventually leading to a mineralization increase.",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1

Lorenzo-Lacruz et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,groundwater level responses to precipitation variability in mediterranean insular aquifers,"groundwater is one of the largest and most important sources of fresh water on many regions under mediterranean climate conditions, which are exposed to large precipitation variability that includes frequent meteorological drought episodes, and present high evapotranspiration rates and water demand during the dry season. the dependence on groundwater increases in those areas with predominant permeable lithologies, contributing to aquifer recharge and the abundance of ephemeral streams. the increasing pressure of tourism on water resources in many mediterranean coastal areas, and uncertainty related to future precipitation and water availability, make it urgent to understand the spatio temporal response of groundwater bodies to precipitation variability, if sustainable use of the resource is to be achieved. we present an assessment of the response of aquifers to precipitation variability based on correlations between the standardized precipitation index (spi) at various time scales and the standardized groundwater index (sgi) across a mediterranean island. we detected three main responses of aquifers to accumulated precipitation anomalies: (i) at short time scales of the spi (<6 months); (ii) at medium time scales (6 24 months); and at long time scales (>24 months). the differing responses were mainly explained by differences in lithology and the percentage of highly permeable rock strata in the aquifer recharge areas. we also identified differences in the months and seasons when aquifer storages are more dependent on precipitation; these were related to climate seasonality and the degree of aquifer exploitation or undergroundwater extraction. the recharge of some aquifers, especially in mountainous areas, is related to precipitation variability within a limited spatial extent, whereas for aquifers located in the plains, precipitation variability influence much larger areas; the topography and geological structure of the island explain these differences. results indicate large spatial variability in the response of aquifers to precipitation in a very small area, highlighting the importance of having high spatial resolution hydro climatic databases available to enable full understanding of the effects of climate variability on scarce water resources.

Eissa et al.,2016,Applied Geochemistry,"groundwater recharge and salinization in the arid coastal plain aquifer of the wadi watir delta, sinai, egypt","the quaternary coastal plain aquifer down gradient of the wadi watir catchment is the main source of potable groundwater in the arid region of south sinai, egypt. the scarcity of rainfall over the last decade, combined with high groundwater pumping rates, have resulted in water quality degradation in the main well field and in wells along the coast. understanding the sources of groundwater salinization and amount of average annual recharge is critical for developing sustainable groundwater management strategies for the long term prevention of groundwater quality deterioration. a combination of geochemistry, conservative ions (cl and br), and isotopic tracers (sr 87/86, delta br 81, delta cl 37), in conjunction with groundwater modeling, is an effective method to assess and manage groundwater resources in the wadi watir delta aquifers. high groundwater salinity, including high cl and br concentrations, is recorded inland in the deep drilled wells located in the main well field and in wells along the coast. the range of cl/br ratios for shallow and deep groundwaters in the delta (similar to 50 97) fall between the end member values of the recharge water that comes from the up gradient watershed, and evaporated seawater of marine origin, which is significantly different than the ratio in modern seawater (228). the sr 87/86 and delta 81br isotopic values were higher in the recharge water (0.70,723 < sr 87/86 < 0.70,894, +0.94 < delta br 81 < +1.28%), and lower in the deep groundwater (0.70,698 < sr 87/86 < 0.70,705, +0.22% < delta br 81 < +0.41%). the delta cl 37 isotopic values were lower in the recharge water ( 0.48 < delta cl 37 <  0.06%) and higher in the deep groundwater ( 0.01 < delta cl 37 < +0.22%). the isotopic values of strontium, chloride, and bromide in groundwater from the wadi watir delta aquifers indicate that the main groundwater recharge source comes from the up gradient catchment along the main stream channel entering the delta. the solute weighted mass balance mixing models show that groundwater in the main well field contains 4 10% deep saline groundwater, and groundwater in some wells along the coast contain 2 6% seawater and 18 29% deep saline groundwater. a three dimensional, variable density, flow and transport seawat model was developed using groundwater isotopes (sr 87/sr 86, delta cl 37 and delta br 81) and calibrated using historical records of groundwater level and salinity. delta o 18 was used to normalize the evaporative effect on shallow groundwater salinity for model calibration. the model shows how groundwater salinity and hydrologic data can be used in seawat to understand recharge mechanisms, estimate groundwater recharge rates, and simulate the upwelling of deep saline groundwater and seawater intrusion. the model indicates that most of the groundwater recharge occurs near the outlet of the main channel. average annual recharge to delta alluvial aquifers for 1982 to 2009 is estimated to be 2.16 x 106 m(3)/yr. the main factors that control groundwater salinity are overpumping and recharge availability.

Bryan et al.,2016,Journal of Hydrology,"island groundwater resources, impacts of abstraction and a drying climate: rottnest island, western australia","coastal aquifers provide a source of water for more than one billion people, with island freshwater lenses being some of the most vulnerable coastal groundwater systems due to their susceptibility to saltwater intrusion. basic hydrogeological and hydrochemical knowledge regarding the recharge and salinisation processes of freshwater lenses is important to ensure sustainable utilisation, especially considering possible climate change effects. this paper makes an assessment of the fate of a freshwater lens in a drying climate through a comparison of current and historic hydrochemical data, which to the author's knowledge is unique to this study. fresh groundwater stable isotope signatures (delta o 18, delta h 2) reflect local amount weighted rainfall signatures (delta o 18:  3.8 parts per thousand; delta h 2:  15.1 parts per thousand), and confirm rainfall as the origin of fresh groundwater (delta o 18:  4.47 to  3.82 parts per thousand; delta h 2:  20.0 to  16.6 parts per thousand). mixing with seawater was identified through enriched groundwater delta o 18 and delta h 2 signatures (maximum values of  0.36 parts per thousand and  1.4 parts per thousand respectively) compared to local rainfall and higher salinity (maximum 29,267 mg/l total dissolved solids (tds)) in a number of monitoring wells around the freshwater lens. enhanced seawater intrusion detected in the northern section of the lens area was identified through significantly increased tds values over the last 20 40 years, with increases of up to 3000% observed between 1990 and 2014. a reduction in the extent of freshwater by approximately 1 km(2) was identified since 1977, which was found to be primarily caused by a reduction in recharge to the freshwater lens due to a similar to 20% decline in winter rainfall in the south west western australian region since the mid 1960s. groundwater abstraction was found to equate to between 5% and 9% of the estimated recharge for the island, and is not a significant factor in the reduction of the lens extent compared to the observed decline in rainfall recharge. interestingly, seawater intrusion into the fresh water lens was found to occur by older seawater (0.03 0.09 tu) in regions of the lens that were previously fresh or slightly brackish, while one sample (0.67 tu) suggests either modern seawater intrusion or mixing of older saline groundwaters (>60 years) with rainfall recharge. the use of tritium dating in this island aquifer was essential in identifying 'older' seawater that was previously unidentified until now. the isotopic and hydrochemical tools used in this paper quantify the effects of groundwater abstraction and climate variability on the freshwater lens and have implications for the sustainable management of the groundwater resource on rottnest island, and elsewhere.

Uddameri et al.,2014,Environmental Earth Sciences,a fuzzy simulation optimization approach for optimal estimation of groundwater availability under decision maker uncertainty,"as groundwater is a slowly replenishing resource that can be depleted relatively easily, there is a growing interest in actively managing aquifer resources. participatory, multi stakeholder driven approaches are increasingly being adopted to plan groundwater use such that the resource is available for present as well as future needs. the state of texas requires neighboring gcds (local regulatory bodies) within a groundwater management area (gma) to engage in joint planning activities and define desired future conditions (dfcs) for the aquifers they regulate. the dfcs are then used to estimate modeled available groundwater which defines how much water is available within an aquifer in a given region. the groundwater joint planning process was modeled using a combined simulation optimization modeling scheme in this study. the response surface methodology was used to establish regional scale aquifer stress response relationships. in addition to average county wide drawdown, other aquifer responses including stream aquifer exchanges, coastal aquifer exchanges and gma wide drawdown were considered to define the dfcs. a constrained linear regression was used in conjunction with a regional groundwater flow model to obtain the necessary response functions which formed the basis for a crisp optimization model whose objective was maximizing groundwater production while ensuring that the prescribed dfcs are not violated (constraints). this model was transformed into a fuzzy linear programming model to account for the fact that groundwater planners find it difficult to specify dfcs with a high degree of precision. using linear membership functions, the decision makers' preferences were captured using two values  a minimum preferred cut off and the maximum allowable value for the metric. for estimating groundwater availability, the fuzzy optimization model reconciles production and maximizes the goal and the constraints representing the dfcs. the developed framework was illustrated by applying it to joint planning in groundwater management area 15 in south texas. the optimization models were highly sensitive to acceptable average drawdowns, while the coastal aquifer interactions had secondary impacts. the fuzzy optimization model yielded lower estimates of groundwater availability in comparison to the crisp optimization scheme. the fuzzy optimization model is therefore consistent with the precautionary principle and recommended for use in the early stages of groundwater planning where incomplete understanding of the aquifer dynamics precludes specification of precise limits for the dfcs.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

Alam et al.,2014,Hydrological Processes,sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater for additional irrigation,"the key to sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater for additional irrigation' is the salt balance of groundwater below an irrigated field. this paper aims to develop a mathematical tool to study the accumulation of salt in the groundwater below an irrigated field as caused by irrigation recirculation. this study derives a salt balance of groundwater to ensure that the additional irrigation from groundwater remains possible in the future. the water and salt budgets by themselves do neither provide information concerning farmers' options nor on the limits of the individual terms in the budget equations. it is presumed that farmers will intuitively aim for (1) an optimal value of the actual evapotranspiration, and (2) a return flow as a feasible low fraction of the available water. we, therefore, derive the irrigation from groundwater q as a consequence of the predefined farmers' aims to achieve a high actual evapotranspiration in combination with a given optimally used irrigation system. our model concludes that the required amount of drainage is only dependent on the ratio of the salinity in the surface irrigation water and the acceptable salinity of the groundwater. the final salinity in the saturated zone only depends on salt carrying inflows and outflows. from the aforesaid model, it is further concluded that sustainable conjunctive use of groundwater for additional irrigation requires long term salt management, which should be founded on the essential controlling factors as derived in this paper. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Alam et al.,2014,Agricultural Water Management,punjab scavenger wells for sustainable additional groundwater irrigation,"we aim to solve the longstanding problem of sustainable groundwater extraction in the pakistani punjab (indus basin). since public scavenging wells were abandoned in the 1990s, farmers have largely embraced the practice of skimming wells to prevent or reduce salinity in their abstracted water. although this may be an effective short term solution, salinity levels will continue to rise overtime, rendering groundwater unsuitable for irrigation. we investigate the creation of balanced scavenging wells to reduce salinization so that sustainable groundwater use is possible as an additional source for irrigation. to achieve such sustainability, a certain amount of brackish water must be discharged, and this amount is determined by assessing the combined salt and waterbudgets. matlab based seawat models were used to show that (1) recirculation wells can substantially delay (but not prevent) salinization as a mid term solution and (2) scavenging is the only long term option to solve the salinization problem. final (i.e., long term) salinity does not depend on hydraulic parameters or initial groundwater salinity, which can only delay or speed up the process of salinization. a sensitivityanalysis showed that vertical anisotropy (ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity) is the most important hydraulic variable for reducing the depth reached by streamlines, which reduces the time required to reach the equilibrium salinity. we conclude: (1) the extraction of freshwater can be determined from leakage, return flow and saltwater extraction; (2) the required saltwater extraction does not depend on freshwater extraction, although for recirculation, saltwater extraction does depend on saltwater injection; and (3) the final salinity in the saturated zone only depends on the salinity of the irrigation water, saltwater extraction, leakage from the irrigation canal system and, in the case of recirculation, the saltwater injection.

Silburn et al.,2013,Crop & Pasture Science,the australian cotton industry and four decades of deep drainage research: a review,"the australian cotton industry and governments have funded research into the deep drainage component of the soil waterbalance for several decades. cotton is dominantly grown in the northern murray darling and fitzroy basins, using furrow irrigation on cracking clays. previously, it was held that furrow irrigation on cracking clays was inherently efficient and there was little deep drainage. this has been shown to be simplistic and generally incorrect. this paper reviews global and northern australian deep drainage studies in irrigation, generally at point  or paddock scale, and the consequences of deep drainage. for furrow irrigated fields in australia, key findings are as follows. (i) deep drainage varies considerably depending on soil properties and irrigation management, and is not necessarily very small'. historically, values of 100 250mm year( 1) were typical, with 3 900mm year( 1) observed, until water shortage in the 2000s and continued research and extension focussed attention on water use efficiency (wue). (ii) more recently, values of 50 100mm year( 1) have been observed, with no deep drainage in drier years; these levels are lower than global values. (iii) optimisation (flow rate, field length, cut off time) of furrow irrigation can at least halve deep drainage. (iv) cotton is grown on soils with a wide range in texture, sodicity and structure. (v) deep drainage is moderately to strongly related to total rainfall plus irrigation, as it is globally. (vi) a leaching fraction, to avoid salt build up in the soil profile, is only needed for irrigation where more saline water is used. drainage from rainfall often provides an adequate leaching fraction. (vii) near saturated conditions occur for at least 2 6m under irrigated fields, whereas profiles are dry under native vegetation in the same landscapes. (viii) deep drainage leachate is typically saline and not a source of good quality groundwater recharge. large losses of nitrate also occur in deep drainage. the consequences of deep drainage for groundwater and salinity are different where underlying groundwater can be used for pumping (fresh water, high yield; e.g. condamine alluvia) and where it cannot (saline water or low yield; e.g. border rivers alluvia). continuing improvements in wue are needed to ensure long term sustainability of irrigated cropping industries. globally there is great potential for increased production using existing water supplies, given deep drainage of 10 25% of water delivered to fields and wue of <50%. future research priorities are to further characterise water movement through the unsaturated zone and the consequences of deep drainage.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Cao et al.,2013,Water Resources Research,use of flow modeling to assess sustainability of groundwater resources in the north china plain,"the north china plain (ncp) is one of the global hotspots of groundwater depletion. currently, our understanding is limited on spatiotemporal variability in depletion and approaches toward more sustainable groundwater development in this region. this study was intended to simulate spatiotemporal variability in groundwater depletion across the entire ncp and explore approaches to reduce future depletion. simulated predevelopment groundwater recharge (similar to 13 km(3)/yr) primarily discharged as base flow to rivers and evapotranspiration. initial groundwater storage was estimated to be 1500 km(3) of drainable storage in shallow aquifers and 40 km(3) of compressive storage in deep aquifers. simulated groundwater depletion from 1960s to 2008 averaged similar to 4 km(3)/yr. cumulative depletion was 50 km(3) (similar to 20% of pumpage) in the piedmont district, 103 km(3) (similar to 20%) in the central plain, and 5 km(3) (12%) in the coastal plain. however, depletion varied with time: similar to 2.5 km(3)/yr in the 1970s, similar to 4.0 in the 1980s, similar to 2.0 in 1990 1996; similar to 7.0 in 1997 2001, and similar to 4.0 in 2002 2008. recharge also varied spatially, averaging similar to 120 mm/yr and concentrated in the piedmont district (200 350 mm/yr) while lower in the central and coastal plains (50 100 mm/yr). simulation of several alternatives, including managed aquifer recharge, increased water use efficiency, brackish water use, and interbasin water transfer, indicated that the combination of these strategies could be used to recover groundwater storage by 50 km(3) over a 15 year period. this study provides valuable insights for developing more sustainable groundwater management options for the ncp; the methods are useful for managing other depleted aquifers. citation: cao, g., c. zheng, b. r. scanlon, j. liu, and w. li (2013), use of flow modeling to assess sustainability of groundwater resources in the north china plain, water resour. res., 49, doi:10.1029/2012wr011899.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Nocchi et al.,2013,Journal of Hydrology,a 3d density dependent model for assessment and optimization of water management policy in a coastal carbonate aquifer exploited for water supply and fish farming,"the ansedonia promontory (southern tuscany, italy) is characterized by the presence of fish farms that pump thermal saline groundwater. the water is extracted from a carbonate aquifer with high permeability due to fracturing and karstification that is also exploited for irrigation purposes and domestic use. such exploitation has led to the degradation of groundwater quality, producing conflict among the different users. the conceptualization of the aquifer allowed the development of a 3d finite element density dependent numerical model using the feflow code. the slightly negative freshwaterbudget in the very humid hydrologic year of 2004 2005 revealed that the aquifer was overexploited, especially due to the extraction of freshwater (along with seawater) from fish farm wells and pumping from public supply wells. the model was also used to forecast the quantitative and qualitative evolution of resources over time, thus testing the effects of different management hypotheses. results demonstrate that the sustainable management of the aquifer mostly depends on withdrawals from public supply wells; the quantity extracted by fish farms only significantly affects the freshwater/saltwater interface and, locally, the salinity of groundwater. actions to counteract seawater intrusion are proposed.

Engelhardt et al.,2013,Environmental Earth Sciences,impact of preboreal to subatlantic shifts in climate on groundwater resources on the arabian peninsula,"a large scale numerical flow and transport model was developed for the central eastern arid part of the arabian peninsula. the model was applied to a region with freshwater resources dating back to more humid periods of the past, which are faced with overexploitation today. model inflow was based on infiltration around wadi beds and groundwater recharge. inflow was balanced by natural outflows, such as evaporation from sabkhas, spring discharge, and discharge to the sea. two models were developed: (1) a short term present day model to estimate effective model parameters, and (2) a long term model to study the development of the groundwater resources during the mid  and late holocene and the natural response of the groundwater system to changes in climate. hydraulic model parameters (hydraulic conductivity and specific storage) were assigned with respect to geological structures. hydraulic parameters were estimated with an inverse pest model by calibrating against observed depression cones cause by groundwater abstraction. sensitivityanalysis demonstrated that estimated model parameters were associated with a high uncertainty at a certain distance from agricultural areas when calibration data were lacking. a long term model starting 10,000 years bp was calibrated by spring discharge and palaeo groundwater levels and validated using measured c 14 groundwater ages. the long model predicted that groundwater levels adapted in response to changes in precipitation. during the mid holocene, which was characterized by an intensification of the monsoon season, groundwater levels increased by 10 m on the mainland within the shallow aquifers and adapted quickly to higher recharge rates. the deeper aquifers were less affected by changes in climate. along the present day coastline, the groundwater level rose by about 25 m due to the declined sea level in the mid holocene. during this period, surface run off was possible as groundwater levels temporarily reached the ground surface. the natural groundwaterbudget reacted sensitively to changes in climate. between 10 and 3 ka, groundwater storage occurred. during the late holocene, at 3 ka, natural depletion of the groundwater system began, which still prevails today.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
Engelhardt et al.,2013,Environmental Earth Sciences,surface and subsurface conceptual model of an arid environment with respect to mid  and late holocene climate changes,"the water demand in arid regions is commonly covered by groundwater resources that date back to more humid periods of the pleistocene and holocene. within the investigated arid part of se saudi arabia information about climate, groundwater levels, and pumping rates are only available for regions where groundwater extractions occur at present day. for the prediction of the impact of long term climate changes on groundwater resources an understanding of the hydrogeological and hydrological past and the development of the aquifers is necessary. therefore, all available information about hydrology and hydrogeology for the past 10,000 years bp were collected and compiled to a conceptual model of the aquifer development on the arabian peninsula since the last ice age. the climatic history was displayed by changes in precipitation, temperature and recharge during the mid s and late holocene. the hydrogeological development is described by groundwater ages, sea level fluctuations, movement of the coastline, and the development of sabkhas. the most sensitive parameter to describe the development of aquifer system is recharge. present day recharge was calculated with the hydrological model system hec hms accounting for current precipitation, temperature, wind, soil types, and geomorphology. with respect to changes in precipitation and temperature over the past 10,000 years the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater recharge was calculated using empirical equations valid for semi arid and arid settings. further inflow into the groundwater system results from surfacewater infiltration in wadi beds, while natural outflow from the groundwater system occurs by discharge to the gulf, evaporation from sabkhas, and spring discharge. backward predictions can be verified by sedimentological observations of palaeo river systems and lakes indicating that groundwater levels reached temporarily the surface under wetter climate conditions and c 14 groundwater ages displaying groundwater residence times.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
Voudouris et al.,2013,Water,hydrogeological characteristics of hellenic aqueducts like qanats,"in ancient hellas, water management began in the early minoan era (ca. 3200 1100 bc) and was related to the geomorphology, the geology, the topography, and the local climatic, hydrological, and socio political conditions. historical and archaeological evidences show that ancient greeks had developed even qanat related technologies since the classical times. during democratic periods, the focus of water management was on sustainable small scale, safe, and cost effective management practices, and institutional arrangements, whereas in oligarchic periods, emphasis was on the construction of large scale hydraulic projects, including aqueducts and/or qanats, mostly related to the public sectors. aqueducts like qanats are gently sloping, artificially constructed underground galleries, which bring groundwater from the mountainous area to the lowlands, where water is used, sometimes several kilometers away. it is worth noticing that no large scale lifting techniques were available, and water was transferred from the source (usually a spring) by aqueducts (qanats) from a higher elevation to a lower level by gravity. historically, the aqueduct like qanat technology was developed by persians in the middle of 1st millennium bc, and spread towards the arabian peninsula and egypt. the expansion of islam led to diffusion of qanats in mediterranean countries (e. g., spain, italy, and cyprus). much of the population of iran and other arid countries in north africa and in asia depend on water supply by aqueducts like qanats, even today. this technology is characterized by its durability and sustainability, although an aqueduct like qanat is expensive, both in construction and maintenance. it is pointed out that, the technique of tunneling was used during the classical period in ancient hellas. since the well known tunnel at the island of samos, hellas, was designed and constructed by eupalinos (ca. 530 bc), several underground tunnels (with and without well like vertical shafts) in order to convey water from one location to another one located in a lower level were implemented in this country. several aqueducts (qanat) paradigms (e. g., in athens, on islands of crete and rhodes, and in the area of serres in north country), which are in use even today, are presented and discussed. overall, it seems that water related problems of modern societies are not very different from those during antiquity.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
Mollema et al.,2013,Environmental Earth Sciences,"waterbudget management of a coastal pine forest in a mediterranean catchment (marina romea, ravenna, italy)","in mediterranean coastal catchments, water management for preservation of pine forests and other natural areas faces particular challenges. limited rainfall, water consumption by vegetation as well as subsidence, drainage and salt water intrusion all play an important role. traditionally forest and water management are carried out independent of one another and do not consider waterbudget calculations. we show with this study that is very important to have quantitative information of all the components of the waterbudget as well as the size of the fresh water lenses in the aquifer to be able to integrate the water  and forest management. we use an integrated hydrologic ecologic methodology based on easily attainable data to assess the monthly waterbudget of a coastal catchment, marina romea (ravenna, italy). we present detailed monthly watertable records, rainfall data, drainage data, tree density and tree perimeter and use published sap flow measurements of single pine trees (pinus pinea) to quantify the actual transpiration of single pine trees in different periods of the year. transpiration amounts to 10 30 l per day per tree. these values are confirmed by independent estimates of tree transpiration based on our waterbudget calculations: 9 34 l/tree/day. because typically there are so many trees in planted pine forests, the total transpiration rates over the whole watershed take up a large percentage (up to 200 %) of the precipitation. in marina romea, four monitoring periods out of twelve, the tree transpiration is larger than precipitation. in nine monitoring periods, drainage in the watershed is larger than precipitation or tree water transpiration. the measurements and calculations show that not much freshwater is left to recharge the fresh water lens underneath marina romea. monthly monitoring of groundwatertable elevation and salinity in the pine forest of marina romea from march 2007 to february 2008 shows that the groundwatertable strongly fluctuates and groundwater salinity is constantly very high (up to 17.7 g/l). analytical calculations based on the ghyben herzberg dupuit principle suggest that even a small continuous annual recharge of 15 mm could form a 2 m deep freshwater lens in the unconfined aquifer. this freshwater lens is not present in the study area and this is due to the fact that tree water transpiration and drainage take out most of the fresh water coming into the watershed. in catchments like marina romea, water consumption by the (natural) vegetation and seasonal differences as well as the fact that fresh water lenses are limited in salty surroundings should be taken into account in water and forest management.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

Mallast et al.,2013,Environmental Earth Sciences,localisation and temporal variability of groundwater discharge into the dead sea using thermal satellite data,"the semi arid region of the dead sea heavily relies on groundwater resources. this dependence is exacerbated by both population growth and agricultural activities and demands a sustainable groundwater management. yet, information on groundwater discharge as one main component for a sustainable management varies significantly in this area. moreover, discharge locations, volume and temporal variability are still only partly known. a multi temporal thermal satellite approach is applied to localise and semi quantitatively assess groundwater discharge along the entire coastline. the authors use 100 landsat etm + band 6.2 data, spanning the years between 2000 and 2011. in the first instance, raw data are transformed to sea surface temperature (sst). to account for groundwater intermittency and to provide a seasonally independent data set a dagger t (maximum sst range) per pixel within biennial periods is calculated subsequently. groundwater affected areas (gaa) are characterised by a dagger t < 8.5 a degrees c. unaffected areas exhibit values > 10 a degrees c. this allows the exact identification of 37 discharge locations (clusters) along the entire dead sea coast, which spatially correspond to available in situ discharge observations. tracking the gaa extents as a direct indicator of groundwater discharge volume over time reveals (1) a temporal variability correspondence between gaa extents and recharge amounts, (2) the reported rigid ratios of discharge volumes between different spring areas not to be valid for all years considering the total discharge, (3) a certain variability in discharge locations as a consequence of the dead sea level drop, and finally (4) the assumed flushing effect of old dead sea brines from the sedimentary body to have occurred at least during the two series of 2000 2001 and 2010 2011.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Ravenscroft et al.,2013,Science of the Total Environment,stable groundwater quality in deep aquifers of southern bangladesh: the case against sustainable abstraction,"in forty six wells >150 m deep, from across the arsenic polluted area of south central bangladesh, groundwater composition remained unchanged between 1998 and 2011. no evidence of deteriorating water quality was found in terms of arsenic, iron, manganese, boron, barium or salinity over this period of 13 years. these deep tubewells have achieved operating lives of more than 20 years with minimal institutional support. these findings confirm that tubewells tapping the deep aquifers in the bengal basin provide a safe, popular, and economic, means of arsenic mitigation and are likely to do so for decades to come. nevertheless, concerns remain about the sustainability of a resource that could serve as a source of as safe water to mitigate as pollution in shallower aquifers in an area where tens of millions of people are exposed to dangerous levels of arsenic in well water. the conjunction of the stable composition in deep groundwater and the severe adverse health effects of arsenic in shallow groundwater lead us to challenge the notion that strong sustainability principles should be applied to the management of deep aquifer abstraction in bangladesh is, the notion that the deep groundwater resource should be preserved for future generations by protecting it from adverse impacts, probably of a minor nature, that could occur after a long time and might not happen at all. instead, we advocate an ethical approach to development of the deep aquifer, based on adaptive abstraction management, which allows possibly unsustainable exploitation now in order to alleviate crippling disease and death from arsenic today while also benefiting future generations by improving the health, education and economy of living children.

Rasmussen et al.,2013,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"assessing impacts of climate change, sea level rise, and drainage canals on saltwater intrusion to coastal aquifer","groundwater abstraction from coastal aquifers is vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise because both may potentially impact saltwater intrusion and hence groundwater quality depending on the hydrogeological setting. in the present study the impacts of sea level rise and changes in groundwater recharge are quantified for an island located in the western baltic sea. the low lying central area of the investigated part of the island was extensively drained and reclaimed during the second half of the 19th century by a system of artificial drainage canals that significantly affects the flow dynamics of the area. the drinking water, mainly for summer cottages, is abstracted from 11 wells drilled to a depth of around 20 m into the upper 5 10 m of a confined chalk aquifer, and the total pumping is only 5 6% of the drainage pumping. increasing chloride concentrations have been observed in several abstraction wells and in some cases the who drinking water standard has been exceeded. using the modeling package modflow/mt3d/seawat the historical, present and future freshwater sea water distribution is simulated. the model is calibrated against hydraulic head observations and validated against geochemical and geophysical data from new investigation wells, including borehole logs, and from an airborne transient electromagnetic survey. the impact of climate changes on saltwater intrusion is found to be sensitive to the boundarycondition of the investigated system. for the flux controlled aquifer to the west of the drained area only changes in groundwater recharge impacts the freshwater sea water interface whereas sea level rise does not result in increasing sea water intrusion. however, on the barrier islands to the east of the reclaimed area, below which the sea is hydraulically connected to the drainage canals, and the boundary of the flow system therefore controlled, the projected changes in sea level, groundwater recharge and stage of the drainage canals all have significant impacts on saltwater intrusion and the chloride concentrations found in abstraction wells.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1

Bouarfa et al.,2012,Irrigation and Drainage,groundwater in irrigation systems: from menace to mainstay,"irrigation systems have changed significantly in the last 50 years. originally supplied by surfacewater, its farming systems depend increasingly on the massive use of groundwater through private tubewells. withdrawals are currently leading to a general decrease in groundwatertable levels which in the past caused waterlogging due to excess surface irrigation. this new context calls for the repositioning of the paradigm of the twin menace of waterlogging and salinity in which the international commission on irrigation and drainage (icid) community defined its concepts. it also requires taking into consideration existing groundwater institutions, often informal and developed locally, more rarely legally recognized processes when moving towards groundwater governance. we present an analytical framework showing the role of these institutions in groundwater governance. this special issue contains a selection of papers presented at the 24th european regional conference of icid in march 2011, organized by its french national committee, afeid. the selected contributions focus on critical analysis of formal and informal institutions at the local scale dealing with groundwater access, restoring the groundwaterbalance and water quality protection. we argue that these analyses can help building a more process oriented approach to policy and engineering, contributing to new modes of groundwater governance. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd.",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Timms et al.,2012,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"implications of deep drainage through saline clay for groundwater recharge and sustainable cropping in a semi arid catchment, australia","the magnitude and timing of deep drainage and salt leaching through clay soils is a critical issue for dryland agriculture in semi arid regions (< 500 mm yr( 1) rainfall, potential evapotranspiration > 2000 mm yr( 1)) such as parts of australia's murray darling basin (mdb). in this rare study, hydrogeological measurements and estimations of the historic waterbalance of crops grown on overlying grey vertosols were combined to estimate the contribution of deep drainage below crop roots to recharge and salinization of shallow groundwater. soil sampling at two sites on the alluvial flood plain of the lower namoi catchment revealed significant peaks in chloride concentrations at 0.8 1.2 m depth under perennial vegetation and at 2.0 2.5 m depth under continuous cropping indicating deep drainage and salt leaching since conversion to cropping. total salt loads of 91 229 t ha( 1) nacl equivalent were measured for perennial vegetation and cropping, with salinity to >= 10 m depth that was not detected by shallow soil surveys. groundwater salinity varied spatially from 910 to 2430 ms m( 1) at 21 to 37 m depth (n = 5), whereas deeper groundwater was less saline (290 ms m( 1)) with use restricted to livestock and rural domestic supplies in this area. the agricultural production systems simulator (apsim) software package predicted deep drainage of 3.3 9.5 mm yr( 1) (0.7 2.1% rainfall) based on site records of grain yields, rainfall, salt leaching and soil properties. predicted deep drainage was highly episodic, dependent on rainfall and antecedent soil water content, and over a 39 yr period was restricted mainly to the record wet winter of 1998. during the study period, groundwater levels were unresponsive to major rainfall events (70 and 190 mm total), and most piezometers at about 18 m depth remained dry. in this area, at this time, recharge appears to be negligible due to low rainfall and large potential evapotranspiration, transient hydrological conditions after changes in landuse and a thick clay dominated vadose zone. this is in contrast to regional groundwater modelling that assumes annual recharge of 0.5% of rainfall. importantly, it was found that leaching from episodic deep drainage could not cause discharge of saline groundwater in the area, since the watertable was several meters below the incised river bed.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
Bakari et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,"groundwater residence time and paleorecharge conditions in the deep confined aquifers of the coastal watershed, south east tanzania","analysis of radiocarbon and stable isotopes of c, h and o in groundwater samples from the coastal watershed of southeastern tanzania is used to decipher the age of groundwater and the climatic conditions at the time of recharge. radiocarbon dating was corrected on the basis of stable carbon isotope ratios and hydrochemical data. two main recharge periods are recognised: (1) a recent recharge period with residence times dated to younger than 1.3 ka bp, for the shallow aquifer and some deep groundwater aquifers; and (2) a paleorecharge occurring during the late pleistocene to holocene transition (between 6 and 13 ka bp), for the lower confined aquifer. the climatic excursions (arid and humid phases) identified in this study match well with those identified from studies of paleo climatic records in tanzania and east africa. the oxygen 18 and radiocarbon results show that there is a potential mixing of groundwater of varying ages along flow paths in the coastal aquifer system. this has also been shown by redox parameters in some of the deeper aquifer samples. the data also revealed that there is relatively simple pattern of lateral groundwater flow in the deeper confined aquifer. isotopic evidence from this study and related studies in paleolimnology improves our knowledge of the past climates. the data suggests that the paleorecharge to the confined aquifer was from inland under wetter climatic conditions than present. therefore, paleorecharge from the adjacent mountain regions to coastal area like ifakara, morogoro and udzungwa mountains could be important parts of recharge area of the kimbiji aquifer. however, the hinterland mountains of dar es salaam (mainly pugu, mkuranga, ruvu and kisarawe) could also play an important role in replenishing the kimbiji coastal aquifers. in contrast, recharge in the shallow unconfined aquifer is characterized by local rainfall and river water infiltration. this study is the first of its kind, assessing fingerprinting of paleoclimates in southeastern coastal tanzania using the isotopic composition of deep groundwater aquifers. the freshwater resources in the neogene aquifer contain paleo groundwater aquifers that have been mixed with recently recharged flow systems. hence, the resources may be sustainable. this study also provides information that may be useful for designing optimum strategies for a sustainable management of groundwater resources in the coastal aquifer, and it testifies to the importance of groundwater as a paleoclimatic archive. such information is also essential for consideration by modellers in their attempts to simulate the hydrogeological processes in confined aquifers over very long time spans.

(2010), (3) environmental impacts of freshwater consumption expressed in damage to resources (delta r), damage to ecosystem quality (delta eq), and damage to human health (delta hh) following pfister et al.

Leblanc et al.,2012,Global and Planetary Change,a review of historic and future hydrological changes in the murray darling basin,"the murray darling basin is australia's food bowl and home to many iconic water bodies that are culturally and ecologically highly valued. the recent millennium drought (from mid 1990s to 2009) was the most severe hydrological drought since records started in the late 19th century. it severely impacted on the basin and for many acted as a wake up call. to address the ongoing declines in water resources and environmental conditions and to prepare the region for climate change, australia's governments are currently attempting to introduce a new comprehensive, and integrated approach to the management of the basin's water resources. in this paper, long term time series of climate, hydrological and environmental data are used to analyze how compounding stresses have gradually affected the hydrological system and its services. major hydroclimatic stresses considered in this paper include salinity, water use, droughts, and climate change. other, more localized or minor stresses exist (groundwater extraction, farm dams, afforestation, bush fires, cyanobacterial blooms and pollutants) and are reviewed more briefly. the history of water policy and planning shows that government actions have been strongly influential on the basin. a shift in the strategic goals from water development to the protection and restoration of environmental assets is noticeable since the mid 1990s. median climate change projections by 2030 indicate smaller reductions in rainfall and runoff than those observed during the recent millennium drought, but have a relatively high uncertainty attached to them. the use of regional approaches to reduce that uncertainty, such as statistical downscaling, points to a sizeable decline in rainfall by the end of the century. most climate projections used for planning consider greenhouse emission scenarios that have smaller global emission trends than the one observed over the last decade. other, 'less optimistic' scenarios have to be considered for long term water planning and food security. compounding all these stresses, is the naturally high hydroclimatic variability of this semi arid region, that may have been insufficiently considered during previous water development and planning efforts. successful water planning will need to balance cultural and ecological values with food production, account for high natural variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, learn from past mistakes and be cognizant of future hydrological changes.

Ettayfi et al.,2012,Journal of Hydrology,"geochemical and isotopic (oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, strontium) constraints for the origin, salinity, and residence time of groundwater from a carbonate aquifer in the western anti atlas mountains, morocco","groundwater in many arid basins, particularly in developing countries, is the only available water resource that sustains local communities. yet, information on the basic hydrological parameters and the sustainability of the groundwater exploitation are often lacking. this study investigates the origin of groundwater from the lower cambrian carbonate aquifer of the lakhssas plateau in the anti atlas mountains of southwestern morocco. the study aims to reveal the origin of the groundwater, salinity sources, and the residence time of the water. the study is based on a comprehensive geochemical and isotopic (oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and strontium) investigation of groundwater from different parts of the basin. the hydrochemical and isotopes results indicated three types of groundwater in the lakhssas plateau: (1) thermal water in the southern part of the basin with solute composition that reflects dissolution of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate minerals; (2) low temperature groundwater at the southern margin of the basin with low salinity (chloride content up to 100 mg/l) and chemical composition that is expected from equilibrium with limestone dolomite rocks; and (3) low temperature groundwater in the northern, western, and eastern margins of the basin with a wide range of salinity (chloride up to 800 mg/l). the different water types had also different stable isotope composition; the thermal water was depleted in o 18 and h 2 (delta o 18 as low as  7.6 parts per thousand) relative to the southern ( 5.9 to  5.3 parts per thousand) and northern waters ( 5.7 to  3.8 parts per thousand). the differences in delta o 18 and delta h 2 between the southern and northern waters are related to elevation that induced fractionation of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in recharge water originated from coastal moisture. the data suggest that the high salinity in groundwater from the northern, western and eastern margins of the lakhssas plateau is related to the presence of schist rocks in these areas. the distinctive low na/cl arid br/cl ratios, coupled with high silica contents and high sr 87/sr 88 ratios (up to 0.713) in the saline groundwater provide additional evidences for the link between salinity and the schist rocks. in contrast, the thermal water had relatively low sr 87/sr 88 ratio (0.7089), which is identical to the secular seawater sr isotope ratio during the early cambrian period and presumably reflects interaction with the early cambrian carbonate and sulfate aquifer rocks. in the northern and southern groundwater, the sr 87/sr 88 ratios were higher and correlated with the mg/ca ratios, inferring mixing between the early cambrian limestone and other rocks with higher sr 87/sr 88, such as the schist rocks. the radiocarbon data showed c 14 activities ranging from 6 pmc in the thermal water to 62 pmc in the southern water. age modeling, corrected for dissolution of the carbonate rocks with dead carbon, simulated mean residence time of 10 15 ka bp for the thermal water and a range of 0 to 3 ka bp for the northern and southern waters, depending on the used models. the integration of the data enables us to establish a conceptual model for the origin of groundwater in the lakhssas plateau: (1) recharge to the aquifer from relatively heavy isotope depleted recharge water, presumably during wetter conditions about 10 15 ka bp. the recharge water interacted at high depth with limestone and calcium sulfate minerals and emerged to the surface as thermal water at the southern part of the basin; (2) more recent recharge from coastal moisture originated from the atlantic ocean. the stable isotope composition of groundwater was controlled by the elevation of their recharge areas: recharge at higher elevation, particularly in the southern margin resulted in lower delta o 18 and delta h 2 values; (3) the recharge water interacted with the carbonate aquifer rocks, particularly with calcite and dolomite minerals. in areas of exposure of schist rocks, the water rock interaction induced salinization of the groundwater. overall, our data reveal that the limited water resources in this semi arid zone of morocco could be in some parts less renewable and also saline. future exploitation of this basin will have to account the salinity factor and the suggested contribution of water recharged some thousands years ago.

Askri et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,development and application of a conceptual hydrologic model to predict soil salinity within modern tunisian oases,"in modern oases situated in the south of tunisia, secondary salination of irrigated lands is a crucial problem. the visible salt deposits and soil salination processes are the consequence of several factors including the excessive use of saline irrigation water, seepage from earthen canal systems, inefficient irrigation practices and inadequate drainage. understanding the mechanism of the secondary salination is of interest in order to maintain existing oases, and thus ensure the sustainability of date production in this part of the country. therefore, a conceptual, daily, semi distributed hydrologic model (oasis mod) was developed to analyse the impact of irrigation management on the watertable fluctuation, soil salinity and drain discharge, and to evaluate measures to control salinity within an oasis ecosystem. the basic processes incorporated in the model are irrigation, infiltration, percolation to the shallow groundwater, soil evaporation, crop transpiration, groundwater flow, capillary rise flux, and drain discharge. oasis mod was tested with data collected in a parcel of farmland situated in the segdoud oasis, in the south west of tunisia. the calibration results showed that groundwater levels were simulated with acceptable accuracy, since the differences between the simulated and measured values are less than 0.22 in. however, the model under predicted some watertable peaks when irrigation occurs due to inconsistencies in the irrigation water data. the validation results showed that deviations between observed and simulated groundwater levels have increased to about 0.5 m due to under estimation of groundwater inflow from an upstream palm plantation. a long term simulation scenario revealed that the soil salinity and groundwater level have three types of variability in time: a daily variability due to irrigation practices, seasonal fluctuation due to climatic conditions and annual variability explained by the increase in cultivated areas. the irrigation interval was found to be important with irrigating once each ten days leading to soil salinity increase during the dry summer season and to a rising watertable during the autumn winter period. the annual increase in the irrigated area caused a decrease of the irrigation water depths, and thus an augmentation of the soil and groundwater salinities. the surface area affected by a soil salinity concentration above 15 g/l has increased from 2% of the study parcel area in june 1992 to about 50% four years later due to the abandonment of several cultivated basins.

Liou et al.,2010,Environmental Earth Sciences,"alternative water resources in granitic rock: a case study from kinmen island, taiwan","kinmen island is a small, tectonically stable, granitic island that has been suffering from a scarcity of fresh water resources due to excessive annual evapotranspiration over annual precipitation. recent studies further indicate that shallow (0 70 m) sedimentary aquifers, the major sources of groundwater supply, have already been over exploited. therefore, this preliminary study is to investigate the existence of exploitable water resources that can balance the shortage of fresh water on this island. site characterization data are obtained from island wide geophysical surveys as well as small scale tests performed in a study area formed by three deep (maximum depth to 560 m) vertical boreholes installed in mid east kinmen northeast to taiwu mountain. vertical fracture frequency data indicate that the rock body is fractured with a spatially correlated pattern, from which three major fracture zones (depths 0 70, 330 360, and below 450 m) can be identified. geologic investigations indicate that the deepest fracture zone is caused by the large scale, steeply dipping taiwushan fault. this fault may have caused a laterally extensive low resistivity zone, a potential fractured aquifer, near taiwu mountain. the middle fracture zone is induced by the taiwushan fault and intersects the fault approximately 21 m southeast of the study area below a depth of 350 m. slug testing results yield fracture transmissivity varying from 4.8 x 10( 7) to 2.2 x 10( 4) m(2)/s. cross hole tests have confirmed that hydraulic connectivity of the deeper rock body is controlled by the taiwushan fault and the middle fracture zone. this connectivity may extend vertically to the sedimentary aquifers through high angle joint sets. despite the presence of a flow barrier formed by doleritic dike at about 300 m depth, the existence of fresh as well as meteoric water in the deeper rock body manifests that certain flow paths must exist through which the deeper fractured aquifers can be connected to the upper rock body. therefore, groundwater stored within the taiwushan fault and the associated low resistivity zone can be considered as additional fresh water resources for future exploitation.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Mair et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,influence of groundwater pumping and rainfall spatio temporal variation on streamflow,"groundwater pumping and surfacewater management structures, i.e. dams and water flow diversions, have been raising serious concerns about the declines in groundwater levels and streamflow in different watersheds throughout the world. small island watersheds with complex landuse, and strong spatio temporal climate and edaphic variability (e.g. hawaiian watersheds) offer an ideal environment to help improve our understanding of groundwater surfacewater interaction and the hydrological processes it involves. in this study, we investigate the spatio temporal relationships between streamflow, rainfall, and groundwater using long term (>40 years) data records from a small hawaiian watershed. a suite of mann kendall tests were used to evaluate trends and shifts in time series data. the impact of groundwater pumping in the valley on streamflow was also investigated; multiple linear regression analysis was used to quantify the effect of pumping on streamflow. stream base flow and total flow have declined significantly since 1960, while rainfall showed no statistically significant trends since the 1960s. groundwater pumping has significantly increased since 1960, and our findings indicate it is a significant contributing factor to streamflow decline. watershed yield experienced two successive downward shifts: first around 1971 1972 and then again around 1991 1992. the first downward shift appears to be related to the pumping of groundwater from the mid valley area which began in 1968. the second downward shift is the result of pumping in the upper valley, which began in 1991. regression models and double mass curve analyses indicate that pumping may have captured significant amounts of groundwater that otherwise would have comprised stream base flow. streamflow has been reduced by 19 22% since 1971 and as much as 36% since 1991.

Stuart et al.,2010,Applied Geochemistry,groundwater residence time and movement in the maltese islands   a geochemical approach,"the maltese islands are composed of two limestone aquifers, the upper and lower coralline limestone separated by an aquitard, the 'blue clay'. the lower coralline limestone is overlain in part by the poorly permeable globigerina limestone. the upper perched aquifers are discontinuous and have very limited saturated thickness and a short water level response time to rainfall. frequent detections of coliforms suggest a rapid route to groundwater. however, the unsaturated zone has a considerable thickness in places and the primary porosity of the upper coralline limestone is high, so there is likely to be older recharge by slow matrix flow as well as rapid recharge from fractures. measurement of sf(6) from a pumping station in a deep part of one of the perched aquifers indicated a mean saturated zone age of about 15 a. the main sea level aquifers (msl) on both malta and gozo have a large unsaturated thickness as water levels are close to sea level. on malta, parts of the aquifer are capped by the perched aquifers and more extensively by the globigerina limestone. the limited detection of coliform bacteria suggests only some rapid recharge from the surface via fractures or karst features. transmissivity is low and (3)h and cfc/sf(6) data indicate that saturated zone travel times are in the range 15 40 a. on gozo the aquifer is similar but is more extensively capped by impermeable blue clay. cfc data show the saturated zone travel time is from 25 a to possibly more than 60 a. groundwater age is clearly related to the extent of low permeability cover. the delta(13)c signature of groundwater is related to the geochemical processes which occur along the flowpath and is consistent with residence time ages in the sequence; perched aquifers < malta msl < gozo msl the (18)o and (2)h enriched isotopic signature of post 1983 desalinated water can be seen in more modern groundwater, particularly the urbanized areas of the perched and malta msl aquifers. in all aquifers, movement of solutes from the surface travelling slowly through the matrix provide a long term source of groundwater contaminants such as no(3).

Mohanty et al.,2010,Water Resources Management,artificial neural network modeling for groundwater level forecasting in a river island of eastern india,"forecasting of groundwater levels is very useful for planning integrated management of groundwater and surfacewater resources in a basin. in the present study, artificial neural network models have been developed for groundwater level forecasting in a river island of tropical humid region, eastern india. ann modeling was carried out to predict groundwater levels 1 week ahead at 18 sites over the study area. the inputs to the ann models consisted of weekly rainfall, pan evaporation, river stage, water level in the drain, pumping rate and groundwater level in the previous week, which led to 40 input nodes and 18 output nodes. three different ann training algorithms, viz., gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate backpropagation (gdx) algorithm, levenberg marquardt (lm) algorithm and bayesian regularization (br) algorithm were employed and their performance was evaluated. as the neural network became very large with 40 input nodes and 18 output nodes, the lm and br algorithms took too much time to complete a single iteration. consequently, the study area was divided into three clusters and the performance evaluation of the three ann training algorithms was done separately for all the clusters. the performance of all the three ann training algorithms in predicting groundwater levels over the study area was found to be almost equally good. however, the performance of the br algorithm was found slightly superior to that of the gdx and lm algorithms. the ann model trained with br algorithm was further used for predicting groundwater levels 2, 3 and 4 weeks ahead in the tubewells of one cluster using the same inputs. it was found that though the accuracy of predicted groundwater levels generally decreases with an increase in the lead time, the predicted groundwater levels are reasonable for the larger lead times as well.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

Currell et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,"recharge history and controls on groundwater quality in the yuncheng basin, north china","environmental isotopes and water quality indicators (e.g. tds and no(3) contents) were used to characterize the age, recharge history and controls on the quality of groundwater resources in the yuncheng basin, north china, where extensive extraction occurs for agriculture and domestic supply. delta(18)o and delta(2)h values as low as  10.6%. and  73 parts per thousand, respectively, together with low radiocarbon activities (<20 pmc) show that deep groundwater comprises palaeowaters largely recharged in the late pleistocene (similar to 10 to 22 ka b.p.) under a cooler climate than the present. shallow groundwater has higher radiocarbon activities (>70 pmc), indicating a significant component of modern (post 1950s) recharge. the shallow groundwater has higher delta(18)o and delta(2)h values (up to  8.1%. and  54 parts per thousand) that are similar to those in modern summer monsoon rainfall, indicating that current recharge is via direct infiltration and/or leakage of ephemeral streams during heavy rain events. historic recharge rates estimated using radiocarbon ages are between 1 and 10 mm/year, corresponding to <2% of local rainfall, which is lower than estimates of modern recharge nearby based on tritium data. the relationship between groundwater delta(18)o values and (14)c ages is similar to that observed in groundwater from other basins in northern china, confirming that much deep groundwater in the region is palaeowater, and suggesting that a broad scale assessment of groundwater residence times may be made from delta(18)o and delta(2)h values. most deep groundwater has low tds and nitrate concentrations (median 1090 mg/l and 1.8 mg/l, respectively), while shallow groundwater has tds contents of up to 8450 mg/l (median 2010 mg/l) and no(3) concentrations up to 630 mg/l (median 31 mg/l). a lack of enrichment in delta(18)o values in the high salinity shallow groundwater indicates that transpiration by crops and possibly minor mineral dissolution are the major salinisation processes, rather than evaporation or leakage from salt lakes. the majority of nitrate in groundwater has delta(15)n (no3) values between 0.8 parts per thousand and 5.0 parts per thousand and delta(18)o(no3) values between 1.8 parts per thousand and 4.1 parts per thousand, indicating that synthetic fertilizers are the main source of elevated no(3) concentrations. increasing residence times from east to west in deep groundwaters reflect the historic regional flow pattern in the basin. however, present day flow is now dictated by a large cone of depression that has formed due to intensive deep groundwater pumping since the 1980s. high downward vertical hydraulic gradients (up to 0.45) have also developed as a result of this pumping, promoting downwards leakage of shallow water, indicated by high nitrate concentrations (>20 mg/l) in some deep wells (>180 m). preferential leakage has occurred near the linyi fault, in the northern sushui river basin. salinisation, nitrate contamination and excessive drawdown of deep groundwater are major concerns for the future of the groundwater resources in this region.

Kourakos et al.,2009,Advances in Water Resources,pumping optimization of coastal aquifers based on evolutionary algorithms and surrogate modular neural network models,"pumping optimization of coastal aquifers involves complex numerical models. in problems with many decision variables, the computational burden for reaching the optimal solution can be excessive. artificial neural networks (ann) are flexible function approximators and have been used as surrogate models of complex numerical models in groundwater optimization. however, this approach is not practical in cases where the number of decision variables is large, because the required neural network structure can be very complex and difficult to train. the present study develops an optimization method based on modular neural networks, in which several small subnetwork modules, trained using a fast adaptive procedure, cooperate to solve a complex pumping optimization problem with many decision variables. the method utilizes the fact that salinity distribution in the aquifer, depends more on pumping from nearby wells rather than from distant ones. each subnetwork predicts salinity in only one monitoring well, and is controlled by relatively few pumping wells falling within certain control distance from the monitoring well. while the initial control area is radial, its shape is aclaptively improved using a hermite interpolation procedure. the modular neural subnetworks are trained adaptively during optimization, and it is possible to retrain only the ones not performing well. as optimization progresses, the subnetworks are adapted to maximize performance near the current search space of the optimization algorithm. the modular neural subnetwork models are combined with an efficient optimization algorithm and are applied to a real coastal aquifer in the greek island of santorini. the numerical code seawat was selected for solving the partial differential equations of flow and density dependent transport. the decision variables correspond to pumping rates from 34 wells. the modular subnetwork implementation resulted in significant reduction in cpu time and identified an even better solution than the original numerical model.

Sultan et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrology,"geochemical, isotopic, and remote sensing constraints on the origin and evolution of the rub al khali aquifer system, arabian peninsula","chemical and stable isotopic compositions of groundwater samples from the rub at khali (rak) in southern saudi arabia were analyzed. samples were collected from wells of variable depth (1.5 800 m) along the perimeter of the eastern half of the rak including flowing artesian wells, pumped wells (formerly artesian), and shallow hand dug wells encompassing those in sabkha areas. data indicate that the water from the artesian and formerly artesian wells represents the contents of confined aquifers. such water (group 1) is isotopicatly depleted (delta(2)h values ranging from  60 parts per thousand. to  35 parts per thousand), and has total dissolved solids (tds) concentrations ranging from 1300 to 76,000 mg/l, indicating that much of the salinity is acquired in the subsurface. water from shallow hand dug wells including those in sabkha areas (group 2) has experienced significant evaporation (5 2 h values ranging from  34 parts per thousand to +19 parts per thousand as well as salinization (tds as high as 92,000 mg/l) by dissolution of sabkha salts including halite and gypsum. stable isotope data for the group 2 water samples define an evaporation trend line originating from the group 1 water samples. this relationship indicates that the group 2 type water evolved from group 1 type water by ascending through structural discontinuities, dissolving evaporative salts, and undergoing substantial near surface evaporation in groundwater discharge zones (sabkhas) characterized by shallow groundwater levels (<2 m). this interpretation is supported by the relatively unradiogenic sr isotope ratios of groundwater samples (sr(87)/sr(86) = 0.70771 0.70874) that are inconsistent with that of modern seawater ((87)sr/(86)sr = 0.70932). the rak aquifer water represents either high elevation recharge from the red sea hills, and/or recharge largely formed of paleo water precipitated during moist climate intervals of the late pleistocene recharging aquifers cropping out at the foothills of the red sea mountains. this inference is supported by a progressive decrease in hydraulic head and increase in groundwater salinity from west to east, substantial precipitation over the red sea hills, and a major e w trending channel network that channels precipitation from the red sea hills toward recharge areas. analysis of 3 hourly trmm (tropical rainfall measuring mission: 1998 2006) precipitation data and digital elevation data shows that 27% of the average annual precipitation (150 x 10(9) m(3)) over the arabian peninsula is channeled toward the recharge zone of the rak aquifer system, of which an estimated 4 x 10(9) m(3) a( 1) to 10 x 10(9) m(3) a( 1) of this water is partitioned as recharge to the rak aquifer system. additional integrated studies on recharge rates, sustainability, and water quality issues for the rak aquifers could demonstrate that the rak is one of the most promising sites for groundwater exploration in the arabian peninsula. results highlight the importance of investigating the potential for sustainable exploitation of similar large aquifer systems that were largely recharged in previous wet climatic periods yet are still receiving modest modern meteoric contributions.

Doll et al.,2008,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,global scale modeling of groundwater recharge,"long term average groundwater recharge, which is equivalent to renewable groundwater resources, is the major limiting factor for the sustainable use of groundwater. compared to surfacewater resources, groundwater resources are more protected from pollution, and their use is less restricted by seasonal and inter annual flow variations. to support water management in a globalized world, it is necessary to estimate groundwater recharge at the global scale. here, we present a best estimate of global scale long term average diffuse groundwater recharge (i.e. renewable groundwater resources) that has been calculated by the most recent version of the watergap global hydrology model wghm (spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees, daily time steps). the estimate was obtained using two state of the art global data sets of gridded observed precipitation that we corrected for measurement errors, which also allowed to quantify the uncertainty due to these equally uncertain data sets. the standard wghm groundwater recharge algorithm was modified for semi arid and arid regions, based on independent estimates of diffuse groundwater recharge, which lead to an unbiased estimation of groundwater recharge in these regions. wghm was tuned against observed long term average river discharge at 1235 gauging stations by adjusting, individually for each basin, the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and total runoff. we estimate that global groundwater recharge was 12 666 km(3)/yr for the climate normal 1961 1990, i.e. 32% of total renewable water resources. in semi arid and arid regions, mountainous regions, permafrost regions and in the asian monsoon region, groundwater recharge accounts for a lower fraction of total runoff, which makes these regions particularly vulnerable to seasonal and inter annual precipitation variability and water pollution. average per capita renewable groundwater resources of countries vary between 8m(3)/(capita yr) for egypt to more than 1 millionm(3)/(capita yr) for the falkland islands, the global average in the year 2000 being 2091 m(3)/(capita yr). regarding the uncertainty of estimated groundwater resources due to the two precipitation data sets, deviation from the mean is 1.1% for the global value, and less than 1% for 50 out of the 165 countries considered, between 1 and 5% for 62, between 5 and 20% for 43 and between 20 and 80% for 10 countries. deviations at the grid scale can be much larger, ranging between 0 and 186 mm/yr.",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1

Ladouche et al.,2005,Journal of Hydrology,hydrochemical assessment of the rochefort marsh: role of surface and groundwater in the hydrological functioning of the wetland,"the interaction between a wetland (the rochefort agricultural marsh) and its underlying aquifers was studied using both geochemical and isotopic approaches. water from the various components of the hydrosystem (water from ditches, shallow 'bri' groundwater (silty clay deposits), deep 'bri' groundwater and groundwater in the kimmeridgian aquifer (confined and unconfined) was sampled and analysed for major and trace elements (sr, br), stable water isotopes (o 18 and h 2) and sr isotopes. the salinity of groundwater in the marsh (cl up to 15.5 g/l) can be attributed to seawater trapped in the clay sediments during the flandrian (12,000 6400 bp). the groundwater has since undergone more or less major chemical evolution due to water rock interactions and mixing with fresh water (rainwater, ditch water and kimmeridgian groundwater from the edge of the marsh). the chemical characteristics of the groundwater in the confined kimmeridgian underlying the bri formation exclude the possibility of a salt wedge. the combined use of delta o 18, delta h 2, cl, br and sr contents and sr 87/sr 86 ratios enabled exchanges between surfacewater in marsh canals and ditches and groundwater in the shallow bri aquifer ( < 2 m), and between groundwater in the deep bri (> 7 m) and in the confined kimmeridgian (> 18 m) aquifers, to be defined and quantified. during the summer, the ditches recharge the shallow bri aquifer by sub irrigation (gravity flow) by up to 26%. the presence of a very compact layer of clay, 1 2 m deep, prevents the rapid recharge of the deep bri aquifer by rainfall and direct hydraulic connections between the ditches and the deep bri aquifer. on the scale of the marsh, the confined kimmeridgian groundwater recharges the bri aquifer by upward flow (maximum contribution estimated to be 76 +/  13%), this flow being relatively limited and preferentially on the edge of the marsh. the deep bri groundwater contributes very locally to recharging the confined kimmeridgian aquifer (maximum contribution estimated to be 61 +/  36%). this study demonstrates the interest in combining hydrological and geochemical tools in order to identify and quantify the hydraulic interconnections between a wetland and its groundwater components. a prior understanding of how wetlands function is crucial for the sustainable management of such ecosystems.

Abdulrazzak et al.,2002,Water International,the role of desalination in meeting water supply demands in western asia,"the increasing gap between the supply and demand for water in the economic and social commission of western asia (escwa) member countries: bahrain, egypt, iraq, jordan, kuwait, lebanon, oman, palestine, qatar saudi arabia, united arab emirates, and yemen) can be attributed to the limited availability of surfacewater mining of fossil groundwater sources, and water pollution mainly of shallow aquifers, deficient institutional structure, poor management processes, and inapt allocation of financial resources. the non sustainable use of natural water resources to meet the escalating water demand has also contributed to the depletion and deterioration of water quality and quantity. to meet water supply shortages in the domestic sector, water desalination has been entrenched as a viable option for the gulf cooperation council (gcc), which includes the following countries: bahrain, kuwait, oman, qatar saudi arabia, and united arab emirates. the objective of the paper is to investigate the role of water desalination in meeting the water demands in the escwa member countries. the significant role of desalination is highlighted with emphasis in evaluating not only its production trends, processes, and costs, but also its capacity in the provision of water demands. water desalination has become a major and staunch water source for a number of large urban centers. for such countries such as bahrain, kuwait, and qatar and the coastal zone areas of oman, united arab emirates (uae), if and saudi arabia, desalination represents one of the most feasible and strategic alternative options for their current and future domestic water supply requirement. given the high consumption rate from this source and its high production cost, fundamental efforts must be integrated and invested in both research and development programs to implement comprehensive conservation measures that would lead to a reduction in the consumption rates. parallel to these achievements, efforts should be directed within the context of integrated management of water resources, to identify alternative potential water resources, to meet future water challenges.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
