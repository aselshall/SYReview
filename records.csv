Hu et al.,2019,Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management,role of heterogeneous behavioral factors in an agent based model of crop choice and groundwater irrigation,"unsustainable groundwater use has led to the lowering of groundwater levels and the degradation of groundwater dependent ecosystems worldwide. integrated hydrologic ecological economic models have been developed to simulate and optimize the coupled human and groundwater systems, and address the issue of unsustainable groundwater use. however, a lack of understanding of the heterogeneity of groundwater users undermines the performance of the integrated models. in this paper, an agent based model is developed using a two stage optimization strategy with the goal of optimizing the decision making of heterogeneous farmers on crop choice and groundwater irrigation. the performance of the optimization strategy is evaluated under the influence of four behavioral factors. the results illustrate that the optimization strategy can lead to higher crop profits or a slower rate of groundwater depletion in comparison with the observations, but does not necessarily guarantee the optimal solution in balancing these two objectives. in order to achieve sustainable groundwater use, the roles that behavioral factors play in farmers' decision making need to be better understood, and better accounted for in groundwater policy.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1
Deines et al.,2019,Environmental Research Letters,quantifying irrigation adaptation strategies in response to stakeholder driven groundwater management in the us high plains aquifer,"irrigation enhances agricultural yields and stabilizes farmer incomes, but overexploitation has depleted groundwater resources around the globe. strategies to address this sustainability challenge differ widely. socio ecological systems research suggests that management of common pool resources like groundwater would benefit from localized approaches that combine self organization along with active monitoring. in 2012, the us state of kansas established a local enhanced management area (lema) program, empowering farmers to work with local and state officials to develop five year, enforceable groundwater conservation programs. here, we assessed the efficacy of the firstlema implemented from 2013 to 2017 using a causal impact methodology based on bayesian structural time series that is new to agrohydrology. compared to control scenarios, we found that the lemareduced water use by 31% over the five year period, with early indications of stabilizing groundwater levels. three main conservation strategies can lead to reduced water use: (1) reducing irrigated area, (2) reducing irrigation amount applied to existing crops through improved efficiency, and/or (3) switching to crops that require less water. to partition water savings among these strategies, we combined satellite derived irrigated areas and crop type maps with well records. wefound that farmers were able to largely maintain irrigated area and achieved the majority of pumping reductions (72%) from improvements in irrigation efficiency, followed by expansion of crops with lower water demand (19%). the results of this analysis demonstrate that conservation programs that are irrigatordriven with regulatory oversight can provide a path toward sustainability in stressed aquifers.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1
Lu et al.,2018,Journal of Cleaner Production,ecological restoration by afforestation may increase groundwater depth and create potentially large ecological and water opportunity costs in arid and semiarid china,"water scarcity is a global environmental problem that jeopardizes human safety and socioeconomic development. since 1952, china has implemented a large scale tree planting program in the country's arid regions to combat desertification. however, there is a serious risk this program will exacerbate water shortages and lower the groundwatertable: the trees selected for this program were not chosen based on local environmental constraints, and their evapotranspiration exceeds the regional precipitation. however, no data on the afforestation's effects on the groundwatertable is available. this is problematic because any loss of groundwater will severely constrain socioeconomic development in china's arid and semiarid regions, which already face severe water shortages. the economic concept of a groundwater opportunity cost could be used to guide socioeconomic activities to improve the sustainability of groundwater use and mitigate the potential problems caused by the chinese afforestation program. in this paper, seven evapotranspiration models were used to provide the first estimate of the opportunity cost created by afforestation's adverse effects on the groundwater resource. the results showed that the groundwatertable declined yearly throughout the study area, with mean water opportunity costs in 2011 ranging from 0.04 x 10(9) rmb to 11.1 x 10(9) rmb under nine provinces in arid and semiarid china. this study provides the first solid evidence that afforestation in arid and semiarid northern china will exacerbate the groundwater decline while creating enormous opportunity costs. thus, the afforestation program must be urgently reassessed and the water use efficiency of vegetation must be considered when planning future ecological restoration both to make the restoration more cost effective and to protect the ecosphere.

Wurl et al.,2018,Journal of Hydrology,"socio hydrological resilience of an arid aquifer system, subject to changing climate and inadequate agricultural management: a case study from the valley of santo domingo, mexico","mismanagement has caused the overexploitation of one third of the major aquifers in mexico, mainly due to excessive water extraction for agricultural irrigation. santo domingo (baja california sur, in northern mexico, where agriculture absorbs nearly 80% of water) is the only aquifer in the mexico where, after a period of overexploitation, equality between extraction and recharge rates was achieved, although this has not meant the securement of long term water availability. this paper offers an analysis of hydrological resilience of a water limited arid ecosystem under future extraction scenarios and changing climate conditions. a regional groundwater flow model is proposed using modflow software. then, different indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts. the aim was to recognize water insecurity scenarios and define appropriate actions to a more sustainable use of this scarce resource in the region. thus, although runoff derived from extreme floods may favor infiltration, the involvement of local stakeholders and decision makers to reverse the adverse impacts of current water management and climate change is imperative if water availability and better quality are to be secured.

Yihdego et al.,2017,Environmental Earth Sciences,"human impact assessment through a transient numerical modeling on the unesco world heritage site, lake naivasha, kenya","lake naivasha was designated as a ramsar site in 1995. the lake environment is fragile and critically threatened by human induced factors. the study presented a steady and transient numerical modeling. the long term and system flux over time interaction between the lake and the surficial aquifer is represented in the lake package lak3 with in the advanced 3 d simulation sofware (gms). the model covers an area of 1817 km(2). model calibration was constrained by the observed groundwater and lake levels using pest. the effect of excessive abstraction was rigorously analyzed via scenario analysis. the simulation was evaluated ""with abstraction'' and ""without abstraction'' scenarios. the abstraction scenario was simulated using range of combination assuming that all the abstraction was from the lake or the groundwater and in the ratio of groundwater and lake water. the effect of the stress was evaluated based on the observed aquifer heads and lake stage at the end of the simulation time. the development of low groundwater level anomalies in the well field is explained. the result indicates that the one of the well fields is not in direct hydraulic connection to the main recharging water body. apparently, similar development of cone of depression was not generated in the other two well fields, and this could have several reasons including due to the fact that these well fields are located relatively close by to the main recharging zones and concluded to have additional source of recharge, and this was supported by previous studies, whereby the isotopic composition of the boreholes has their source of recharge from precipitation and river and was also confirmed from the isotopic composition of unsaturated zone, which is a mixture of river and rain. the study reveals that seasonal variability of groundwater surfacewater exchange fluxes and its spatially and temporally variable impact substantially on the water resource availability. such analysis can be used as a basis to quantify the linkages between the surfacewater and groundwater regime and impacts in the basin. the model output is expected to serve as a basis via linking/coupling with others to incorporate the ecology and biodiversity of the lake to safeguard this high  value world heritage water feature.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1
Yang et al.,2017,Hydrogeology Journal,"groundwater and surfacewater interactions and impacts of human activities in the hailiutu catchment, northwest china","the interactions between groundwater and surfacewater have been significantly affected by human activities in the semi arid hailiutu catchment, northwest china. several methods were used to investigate the spatial and temporal interactions between groundwater and surfacewater. isotopic and chemical analyses of water samples determined that groundwater discharges to the hailiutu river, and mass balance equations were employed to estimate groundwater seepage rates along the river using chemical profiles. the hydrograph separation method was used to estimate temporal variations of groundwater discharges to the river. a numerical groundwater model was constructed to simulate groundwater discharges along the river and to analyze effects of water use in the catchment. the simulated seepage rates along the river compare reasonably well with the seepage estimates derived from a chemical profile in 2012. the impacts of human activities (river water diversion and groundwater abstraction) on the river discharge were analyzed by calculating the differences between the simulated natural groundwater discharge and the measured river discharge. water use associated with the hailiutu river increased from 1986 to 1991, reached its highest level from 1992 to 2000, and decreased from 2001 onwards. the reduction of river discharge might have negative impacts on the riparian ecosystem and the water availability for downstream users. the interactions between groundwater and surfacewater as well as the consequences of human activities should be taken into account when implementing sustainable water resources management in the hailiutu catchment.",1,1,0,1,1,1,4,0,0,1
Xu et al.,2017,Polish Journal of Environmental Studies,river health evaluation based on the fuzzy matter element extension assessment model,"the measured values of river health indexes that are not necessarily in the same range of a certain health grade level cause the problem of how to classify the actual status of river health. to solve such incompatibility and evaluate the health condition of a river ecosystem objectively we can use the river health integrated index (rhi), which was determined by the fuzzy matter element extension assessment model (fmeam). fmeam was established by combining the fuzzy matter element extension assessment method with the proposed aggregative index system. by employing the model above, as well as data from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, we evaluated the health state of the luanhe river. the results showed that the luanhe river was in a sub healthy state in the 1980s and in an unhealthy state in the 1990s and 2000s. the reasons leading to the luanhe river's health degradation have been analyzed. among them, water conservation projects' building and operations are the major influence factors. waste water emissions, the expansion of urban built up areas, overexploitation of groundwater, and other unreasonable human activities also intensified the river ecosystem degradation. finally, countermeasures for the ecological restoration and protection of the river were put forward.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1
Ruperez-Moreno et al.,2017,Agricultural Water Management,"sustainability of irrigated agriculture with overexploited aquifers: the case of segura basin (se, spain)","the structural water deficit suffered by the segura basin in southern spain trend toward unsustainability. the imbalance between the resources and the demand has been caused by the expansion of irrigated areas, the emergence of illegal new irrigated lands and pumping wells, the increase in energy cost and the bad management of water use rights by the public water administration. in addition, climate change and frequent drought in this semi arid region aggravate the situation. as a consequence, many aquifers are overexploited. the region of murcia has well developed agri food sector, which is a key factor in, the regional economy. this sector accounts for 21.4% of the regional gdp, and murcia also has an important tourism sector, so the overexploitation of the aquifers would concern production, exportation and agricultural development as well as the decline in the water level, environmental damage and water quality impairment. on the other hand, the fulfilment of the ""good ecological status"" objectives set by the water framework directive, with a deadline of 2027, will be a difficult task for water managers. this study proposed a hydroeconomic model to obtain the cost of the overexploited aquifers in the segura basin in order to decide on the feasibility of using groundwater for agriculture in situations of overexploitation. the results showed that the price paid by farmers for irrigation water in the year 2027 would be 0.53(sic)/m(3) (i.e., annual spending of 180(sic)), which will involve 10% of the final agricultural crop production in the region of murcia. alternative water sources are proposed to increase water supply security for farmers and to ensure the socio economic and environmental sustainability of the basin. finally, the methodology proposed would help to manage water use in other european mediterranean basins under similar climatic, hydrological and agricultural conditions.

Mencio et al.,2017,Journal of Hydrology,groundwater dependence of coastal lagoons: the case of la pletera salt marshes (ne catalonia),"coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems of the world, playing an important role in coastal defense and wildlife conservation. these ecosystems, however, are usually affected by human activities, which may cause a loss and degradation of their ecological status, a decline of their biodiversity, an alteration of their ecological functioning, and a limitation of their ecosystem services. la pletera salt marshes (ne spain) are located in a region mainly dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. part of these wetlands and lagoons has been affected by an incomplete construction of an urban development and in this moment is the focus of a life(+) project, whose aim is to restore this protected area. several studies have analyzed the role of hydrological regime in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton in this area, however, the role of groundwater was never considered as a relevant factor in the lagoon dynamics, and its influence is still unknown. in this study, the hydrogeological dynamics in la pletera salt marshes has been analyzed, as a basis to set sustainable management guidelines for this area. in order to determine their dependence on groundwater resources, monthly hydrochemical (with major ions and nutrients) and isotopic (delta o 18(h2o) and delta d) campaigns have been conducted, from november 2014 to october 2015. in particular, groundwater from six wells, surfacewater from two nearby streams and three permanent lagoons, and sea water was considered in these surveys. taking into account the meteorological data and the water levels in the lagoons, the general lake model has been conducted to determine, not only evaporation and rainfall occurring in the lagoons, but also the total inflows and outflows. in addition, the gonfiantini isotopic model, together with equilibrium chemical speciation/mass transfer models, has been used to analyze the evaporation and the physicochemical processes affecting the lagoons. results show that during the dry season groundwater inputs may account for 15 80% of the water in la pletera lagoons. besides, water salinity depends on two main processes: 1) mixing of fresh and sea water occurring within the lagoons or in the aquifer; and 2) evaporation. according to the obtained results, the goal of preserving la pletera lagoons and their salinity conditions implies maintaining groundwater fluxes towards the ocean, and also the hydraulic connectivity of these lagoons with the aquifer.

Qureshi et al.,2010,Irrigation and Drainage,sustainable groundwater management in pakistan: challenges and opportunities,"in pakistan, accessibility to groundwater is a dividing line between poverty and welfare. access to groundwater allows poor people to not only increase their production and incomes, but also reduce their vulnerability against external shocks. however, the present uncontrolled and unregulated use of groundwater is replete with serious consequences. rapidly falling groundwatertables and increasing salt content in the pumped groundwater are threatening the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. this paper reviews the challenges faced by pakistan due to unsustainable use of groundwater and identifies opportunities for improving its management. the paper suggests that there is a need for a more refined understanding of the peculiarities and socio ecology of groundwater before identifying management solutions. in addition to institutional reforms, supply and demand management approaches also need to be followed. for demand management, farmers should adopt improved irrigation and agronomic practices. current landuse patterns should be reviewed to replace water intensive crops with water efficient crops. for supply management, use of waste water and saline drainage effluent for agriculture should be promoted. in rain fed areas, more efforts should be focused on rainwater harvesting. effective coordination between organizations responsible for the management of groundwater resources also needs to be enhanced. copyright (c) 2008 john wiley & sons, ltd.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1
Rivera et al.,2008,Geoscience Canada,international year of planet earth 3. groundwater sustainable development in canada   emerging issues,"development of sustainable groundwater management in canada requires an integrated approach, including scientific knowledge and managerial and institutional issues. the priority areas that must be considered to assure the sustainable use of groundwater include factors related to groundwater availability and use; these are based on aquifer knowledge (hydrogeological maps, waterbudgets), as well as social (water demands), political (water laws and regulations), economical, and environmental issues (ecosystem needs). outside of the permafrost shield, groundwater is ubiquitous in most of the landmass of canada but its distribution (quantity and quality) is orgy well known in scattered parts of the country to sustain groundwater supplies in urban and rural areas, the management of groundwater resources should be supported by strong science based programs with scientific knowledge of groundwater availability' vulnerability and sustainability and should be incorporated with water laws and regulations. a case study of an aquifer located in the province of quebec reveals the consequences of the use of groundwater beyond sustainable pumping rates. this case study involved detailed assessment of the aquifer and 3d numerical simulations of the current and predictive scenarios of groundwater withdrawals. a synthesis of the current knowledge of groundwater resources in the world and in canada as well as the state of the art of the groundwater sciences, future research activities and other emerging issues with respect to the environment, society and policy, complete this overview.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1
Dadaser-Celik et al.,2007,Water International,hydrologic sustainability of the sultan marshes in turkey,"hydrologic changes in the sultan marshes ecosystem, a closed basin wetland in the semi arid develi basin in south central turkey, are analyzed and related to intensification of irrigated agriculture in the catchment. relationships between water level changes in the marsh, and inflows and outflows of surfacewater and groundwater are examined. since the 1980s, surface runoff from the surrounding mountains into the develi basin has been captured in three major reservoirs and used for flood irrigation. substantial declines in seasonally fluctuating water levels were recorded in the sultan marshes from 1993 to 2003. our analysis shows that these trends are related to decreases in inflows from groundwater and springs, not to climatic changes. simulations with a deterministic hydrologic model for the ortuluakar marsh, a sub system of the sultan marshes, as well as statistical analyses, showed that it is necessary to reduce water use from groundwater and springs to maintain pre 1995 marsh water levels. alternative groundwater management scenarios to sustain both the wetland and irrigated agriculture in the develi basin were tested. a 50% reduction in groundwater and spring water use for irrigation showed promising results for the sultan marshes. irrigation in the basin uses 66% surfacewater and 34 % groundwater. a 50% reduction in groundwater use for irrigation therefore represents less than 20 % of total irrigation water used. reduction in groundwater use is, however, linked to social and economic conditions in the develi basin, and incentives that encourage farmers to adopt sustainable groundwater use practices need to be developed.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1
Mukherji et al.,2005,Hydrogeology Journal,groundwater socio ecology and governance: a review of institutions and policies in selected countries,"groundwater is crucial for the livelihoods and food security of millions of people, and yet, knowledge formation in the field of groundwater has remained asymmetrical. while, scientific knowledge in the discipline (hydrology and hydrogeology) has advanced remarkably, relatively little is known about the socio economic impacts and institutions that govern groundwater use. this paper therefore has two objectives. the first is to provide a balanced view of the plus and the down side of groundwater use, especially in agriculture. in doing so, examples are drawn from countries such as india, pakistan, bangladesh, china, spain and mexico all of which make very intensive use of groundwater. second, institutions and policies that influence groundwater use are analyzed in order to understand how groundwater is governed in these countries and whether successful models of governance could be replicated elsewhere. finally, the authors argue that there is a need for a paradigm shift in the way groundwater is presently perceived and managed from management to governance mode. in this attempt, a number of instruments such as direct regulation, indirect policy levers, livelihood adaptation and people's participation will have to be deployed simultaneously in a quest for better governance.",1,1,1,1,0,1,2,0,1,1
Custodio et al.,2002,Hydrogeology Journal,aquifer overexploitation: what does it mean?,"groundwater overexploitation and aquifer overexploitation are terms that are becoming common in water re sources management. hydrologists. managers and journalists use them when talking about stressed aquifers or some groundwater conflict. overexploitation may be defined as the situation in which, for sonic years, average aquifer abstraction rate is, greater than. or close to the average recharge rate. but rate and extent of recharge areas are often very uncertain. besides, they may be modified by human activities and aquifer development. in practice, however, an aquifer is often considered as overexploited when some persistent negative results of aquifer development are felt or perceived. such as a continuous water level drawdown. progressive water quality deterioration, increase of abstraction cost. or ecological damage. but negative results do not necessarily imply that abstraction is greater than recharge. they may be simply due to well interferences and the long transient period that follow changes in the aquifer waterbalance. groundwater storage is depleted to some extent during the transient period after abstraction is increased. its duration depends on aquifer size. specific storage and permeability. which level of ""aquifer overexploitation"" is advisable or bearable. depends oil the detailed and updated consideration of aquifer development effects and the measures implemented for correction. this should not be the result of applying general rules based on sonic indirect data. monitoring. sound aquifer knowledge, and calculation or modelling, of behaviour are needed in the framework of a set of objectives and policies. they should be established by a management institution, with the involvement of groundwater stakeholders, and take into account the environmental and,octal constraints. aquifer overexploitation. which often is perceived to be associated with something ethically bad, is not necessarily detrimental if it is not permanent. it may be a,step towards sustainable development. actually, the term aquifer overexploitation is mostly a qualifier that intends to point to a concern about the evolution of the aquifer flow system in some specific, restricted points of view, but without a precise hydrodynamic meaning. implementing, groundwater management and protection meat sures needs quantitative appraisal of aquifer evolution and effects based on detailed multidisciplinary studies. which have to he supported by reliable data.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
