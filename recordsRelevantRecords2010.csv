Abdel-Dayem et al.,2006,Irrigation and Drainage,an integrated approach to land drainage,"it is common to define drainage as a means to enhance crop production and increase productivity. in order to meet this objective, drainage systems are designed and managed to maintain favourable moisture and salt conditions in the root zone. examples from around the world show that drainage has done well to achieve this objective. however, lessons show that many impacts of drainage, positive and negative, have been overlooked, including those on health, built up settlements and infrastructure, flood management, groundwater recharge, sanitation, surface and groundwater quality, fisheries and aquatic life, and the environment in general. thus, the single objective approach takes drainage out of the broader context of land and water management and diminishes the overall gains of improved drainage and ignores its full cost. it does also not allow the stakeholders from outside the farming community to be involved in the decision making leading to conflict of interests. it also misses an important opportunity for increasing the financing potential. a better understanding of drainage as a practice for managing the multiple functions of land and water resources is needed in order to achieve an optimal mix of economic and social gains, sustainable natural resources management and a healthy environment. this would only be possible when an interdisciplinary and integrated approach is followed in planning and managing land drainage. the approach, called drainframe, is a framework for analysis, communication, discussion, and decision making by all stakeholders. it looks at the overall social, economic, and environmental productivity of the entire water management system, of which drainage is an integral part. it allows comprehensive analysis and assessment of basin wide social and economic impacts of drainage following a participatory planning approach. although the methodology was developed from a drainage perspective, it is geared towards natural resources management planning in general. it can be equally used in planning irrigation, flood control or watershed management projects. the drainframe approach was applied in planning some new world bank supported projects in egypt and pakistan with the objective of promoting the concept of integrated water resources management. copyright (c) 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Abderrahman et al.,2005,International Journal of Water Resources Development,groundwater management for sustainable development of urban and rural areas in extremely arid regions: a case study,"in saudi arabia, the recharge to local and regional aquifers is mostly indirect, very limited and insignificant, especially with low annual precipitation. most of the stored groundwater in local and regional aquifers is non renewable fossil water. with rapid socio economic developments and increasing population coupled with agricultural and industrial growth in the kingdom, especially after the large increase in oil revenues after 1974, the water demands have increased drastically. by understanding the aquifer features, the country followed a planned approach based on controlling aquifer development and demand management to use its groundwater resources. the socio economic developments in rural areas have been very pronounced. corrective demand management measures including reduction in cultivated areas and modification in agricultural support policies in addition to the augmentation of water supplies by the reuse of treated wastewater have reduced the stress on groundwater. the establishment of a special ministry for water and the adoption of a national water planning approach and the use of an integrated water resources management tool are expected to contribute effectively to the achievement of sustainable groundwater resources and the national interest of the country."
Abdulrazzak et al.,2002,Water International,the role of desalination in meeting water supply demands in western asia,"the increasing gap between the supply and demand for water in the economic and social commission of western asia (escwa) member countries: bahrain, egypt, iraq, jordan, kuwait, lebanon, oman, palestine, qatar saudi arabia, united arab emirates, and yemen) can be attributed to the limited availability of surfacewater mining of fossil groundwater sources, and water pollution mainly of shallow aquifers, deficient institutional structure, poor management processes, and inapt allocation of financial resources. the non sustainable use of natural water resources to meet the escalating water demand has also contributed to the depletion and deterioration of water quality and quantity. to meet water supply shortages in the domestic sector, water desalination has been entrenched as a viable option for the gulf cooperation council (gcc), which includes the following countries: bahrain, kuwait, oman, qatar saudi arabia, and united arab emirates. the objective of the paper is to investigate the role of water desalination in meeting the water demands in the escwa member countries. the significant role of desalination is highlighted with emphasis in evaluating not only its production trends, processes, and costs, but also its capacity in the provision of water demands. water desalination has become a major and staunch water source for a number of large urban centers. for such countries such as bahrain, kuwait, and qatar and the coastal zone areas of oman, united arab emirates (uae), if and saudi arabia, desalination represents one of the most feasible and strategic alternative options for their current and future domestic water supply requirement. given the high consumption rate from this source and its high production cost, fundamental efforts must be integrated and invested in both research and development programs to implement comprehensive conservation measures that would lead to a reduction in the consumption rates. parallel to these achievements, efforts should be directed within the context of integrated management of water resources, to identify alternative potential water resources, to meet future water challenges."

Ahmad et al.,2002,Irrigation and Drainage,sustainable use of groundwater for irrigation: a numerical analysis of the subsoil water fluxes,"the food producing regions of the world increasingly rely on irrigation from groundwater resources. further increases of groundwater use can adversely affect the sustainability of irrigated agriculture and put food security at risk. sustainability of irrigation at field scale with groundwater is obtained if groundwater recharge is in equilibrium with tubewell extractions and capillary rise. traditional information on phreatic surface behaviour does not explain the processes causing a phreatic surface to decline or incline. in this study, the physically based numerical model soil water atmosphere plant (swap) was applied to compute soil moisture content and vertical soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone for the cotton wheat and rice wheat cropping system of punjab, pakistan. swap has been calibrated and verified with in situ measurements of soil moisture content and evapotranspiration fluxes measured by means of the bowen ratio surface energy balance technique. accurate data of the soil hydraulic properties are critical for the calibration of the soil moisture distribution. with knowledge of the van genuchten mualem parameters available, swap could be applied to assess recharge and capillary rise for most field conditions, including basin irrigation. the results under pakistani conditions show that deep percolation cannot always be estimated from root zone waterbalances. an annual recharge of 23.3 cm was computed for the cotton wheat area. sustainability of irrigation with groundwater is obtained if a reduction in irrigation with groundwater by 36% is obtained. an annual recharge of 38.9 cm is estimated in rice wheat systems, and a reduction of 62% in groundwater extraction is required to reach sustainability of groundwater use at field scale. such information cannot be obtained from classical phreatic surface fluctuation data, and unsaturated zone modelling therefore provides additional insights for groundwater policy making. copyright (c) 2002 john wiley sons, ltd."
Ahmad et al.,2005,Hydrogeology Journal,"a new technique to estimate net groundwater use across large irrigated areas by combining remote sensing and waterbalance approaches, rechna doab, pakistan","overexploitation of groundwater resources threatens the future of irrigated agriculture, especially in the arid and semi arid regions of the world. in order to reverse this trend, and to ensure future food security, the achievement of sustainable groundwater use is ranking high on the agenda of water policy makers. spatio temporally distributed information on net groundwater use i.e. the difference between tubewell withdrawals for irrigation and net recharge is often unknown at the river basin scale. conventionally, groundwater use is estimated from tubewell inventories or phreatic surface fluctuations. there are shortcomings related to the application of these approaches. an alternative methodology for computing the various waterbalance components of the unsaturated zone by using geo information techniques is provided in this paper. with this approach, groundwater recharge will not be quantified explicitly, but is part of net groundwater use, and the spatial variation can be quantitatively described. records of routine climatic data, canal discharges at major offtakes, phreatic surface depth fluctuations, and simplified information on soil textural properties are required as input data into this new geographic information system and remote sensing tool. the rechna doab region (approximately 2.97 million ha), located in the indus basin irrigation system of pakistan, has been used as a case study. on an annual basis, an areal average net groundwater use of 82 mm year( 1) was estimated. the current result deviates 65% from the specific yield method. the deviation from estimates using tubewell withdrawal related data is even higher."
Aida et al.,2006,Molecular and Cellular Biology,transcriptional pausing caused by nelf plays a dual role in regulating immediate early expression of the junb gene,"human 5,6 dichloro 1 beta d ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity inducing factor (dsif) and negative elongation factor (nelf) negatively regulate transcription elongation by rna polymerase ii (rnapii) in vitro. however, the physiological roles of this negative regulation are not well understood. here, by using a number of approaches to identify protein dna interactions in vivo, we show that dsif  and nelf mediated transcriptional pausing has a dual function in regulating immediate early expression of the human junb gene. before induction by interleukin 6, rnapii, dsif, and nelf accumulate in the promoter proximal region of junb, mainly at around position +50 from the transcription initiation site. after induction, the association of these proteins with the promoter proximal region continues whereas rnapii and dsif are also found in the downstream regions. depletion of a subunit of nelf by rna interference enhances the junb mrna level both before and after induction, indicating that dsif  and nelf mediated pausing contributes to the negative regulation of junb expression, not only by inducing rnapii pausing before induction but also by attenuating transcription after induction. these regulatory mechanisms appear to be conserved in other immediate early genes as well."

Allam et al.,2003,Desalination,desalination of brackish groundwater in egypt,"fresh groundwater resources in egypt contribute to some 20% of the total potential of water resources in egypt. the ministry of water resources and irrigation (mwri) increasingly recognizes its importance in the overall water resources management. the need for a more comprehensive groundwater management approach has led to the establishment of the groundwater sector (gws) in december 1999. the gws is now the sole responsible governmental agency for management of all groundwater resources and related water resources. the mandate of the gws is: formulating and implementing the general policy for developing and managing groundwater and related water resources (flash floods, rainwater harvesting and desalinated water) on the national, regional and sub regional level. desalination of brackish groundwater in egypt has a great potential. with respect to the availability of the resource. all major aquifer systems in egypt contain vast quantities of brackish groundwater. the exploitation of this resource is still limited. with the current low price of brackish water desalination there is a growing interest towards its exploitation. brackish water desalination plants in egypt confirm the potential of this solution. other uses for brackish groundwater that are being considered are agriculture (salt tolerant crops) and fisheries (shrimp farms). the elements of the vision for desalination of brackish groundwater are: environmental sustainability through recycling of water and re infiltration; public private partnerships for exploitation, especially in the tourism sector; private sector financing through accepted modalities (bot, dbo, etc.). with the input of experience from the netherlands through the gws project a new program for desalination was started. this program aims to provide the necessary concepts and data on desalination of brackish groundwater in egypt to allow the gws to formulate a clear policy in this regard."
Alley et al.,2004,Ground Water,the journey from safe yield to sustainability,"safe yield concepts historically focused attention on the economic and legal aspects of groundwater development. sustainability concerns have brought environmental aspects more to the forefront and have resulted in a more integrated outlook. water resources sustainability is not a purely scientific concept, but rather a perspective that can frame scientific analysis. the evolving concept of sustainability presents a challenge to hydrologists to translate complex, and sometimes vague, socioeconomic and political questions into technical questions that can be quantified systematically. hydrologists can contribute to sustainable water resources management by presenting the longer term implications of groundwater development as an integral part of their analyses."
Amaral et al.,2007,Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,enhanced killing of intracellular multidrug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis by compounds that affect the activity of efflux pumps,"whereas human neutrophils are effective and efficient killers of bacteria, macrophages such as those derived from monocytes are almost devoid of killing activity. nevertheless, monocytes can be transformed into effective killers of mycobacteria or staphylococci when exposed to clinical concentrations of a phenothiazine or to inhibitors of eff lux pumps (reserpine and verapamil), or to ouabain, an inhibitor of k+ transport. because the rates of multidrug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis (mdr tb) continue to escalate globally, and because no new effective drug has been made available for almost 40 years, compounds that enhance the killing activity of monocytes against mdr tb are obviously needed. this review covers the specific characteristics of mdr tb, identifies a variety of agents that address these characteristics and therefore have potential for managing mdr tb. because the mechanism by which these agents enhance the killing of intracellular bacteria is important for the intelligent design of new anti tubercular agents, the review correlates the mechanisms by which these agents manifest their effects. lastly, a model is presented which describes the mechanisms by which distinct efflux pumps of the phagosome lysosome complex are inhibited by agents that are known to inhibit k+ flux. the model also predicts the existence of a k+ activated exchange (pump) that is probably located in the membrane that delineates the lysosome. this putative pump, which is immune to inhibitors of k+ flux, is identified as being the cause for the acidification of the lysosome thereby activating its hydrolytic enzymes. because the non killer macrophage can be transformed into an effective killer by a variety of compounds that inhibit k+ transport, perhaps it would be wise to develop drugs that enhance the killing activity of these cells inasmuch as this approach would not be subject to any resistance, as is the eventual case for conventional antibiotics."
Andersen et al.,2009,Hydrogeology Journal,"stream aquifer interactions in the maules creek catchment, namoi valley, new south wales, australia","the interaction between surfacewater streams and groundwater in the maules creek catchment of northern new south wales, australia has been investigated using a wide range of techniques. zones of groundwater discharge were mapped by measuring the temperature and fluid electrical conductivity distribution in bores and surfacewater. zones where surfacewater appears to be recharging the aquifer were investigated by measuring the vertical head gradient between the stream and adjacent bores and by estimates of the decreasing surface flow. geological heterogeneity appears to be the most significant factor in controlling exchange. lithological information was assembled using geophysical logging of existing bores, supplemented by the results of electrical resistivity imaging. a preliminary waterbalance was assembled from the available state records of groundwater abstraction for irrigation, rainfall, evapotranspiration and flow gauging in maules creek and the adjacent namoi river. the analysis has demonstrated the complexity of these coupled systems and gives an indication of the most efficient techniques to be deployed in the field to investigate these complex but important systems."
Andrei et al.,2008,Journal of Wildlife Management,habitat use by migrant shorebirds in saline lakes of the southern great plains,"shorebirds migrating through the southern great plains of north america use saline lakes as stopovers to rest and replenish energy reserves. to understand how availability of invertebrates, salinity, freshwater springs, vegetation, and water influence the value of saline lakes as migration stopovers, we compared lakes used and not used by migrant shorebirds. shorebirds used lakes that had freshwater springs, mudflats and standing water, sparse vegetation (<= 1% cover), low to moderate salinities (x = 30.87 g/l), and mean invertebrate biomass of 0.79 g/m(2). lakes that were not used were generally dry or had hypersaline water (x = 82.56 g/l), lacked flowing springs and vegetation, and had few or no invertebrates (x = 0.007 g/m(2)). our results suggest that reduced spring flows and increased salinity negatively affect availability of shorebird habitats and aquatic invertebrates. we recommend preservation of the freshwater springs discharging in the saline lakes. because the springs are discharged from the ogallala aquifer, which is recharged through the playa wetlands, the entire complex of wetlands in the great plains and the ogallala aquifer should be managed as an integral system."

Archer et al.,2010,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,sustainability of water resources management in the indus basin under changing climatic and socio economic conditions,"pakistan is highly dependent on water resources originating in the mountain sources of the upper indus for irrigated agriculture which is the mainstay of its economy. hence any change in available resources through climate change or socio economic factors could have a serious impact on food security and the environment. in terms of both ratio of withdrawals to runoff and per capita water availability, pakistan's water resources are already highly stressed and will become increasingly so with projected population changes. potential changes to supply through declining reservoir storage, the impact of waterlogging and salinity or over abstraction of groundwater, or reallocations for environmental remediation of the indus delta or to meet domestic demands, will reduce water availability for irrigation. the impact of climate change on resources in the upper indus is considered in terms of three hydrological regimes   a nival regime dependent on melting of winter snow, a glacial regime, and a rainfall regime dependent on concurrent rainfall. on the basis of historic trends in climate, most notably the decline in summer temperatures, there is no strong evidence in favour of marked reductions in water resources from any of the three regimes. evidence for changes in trans himalayan glacier mass balance is mixed. sustainability of water resources appears more threatened by socio economic changes than by climatic trends. nevertheless, analysis and the understanding of the linkage of climate, glaciology and runoff is still far from complete; recent past climate experience may not provide a reliable guide to the future."
Arshad et al.,2009,International Journal of Agriculture and Biology,"simulating seepage from branch canal under crop, land and water relationships","the rapid growth of tubewells in the indus basin of pakistan shows significant contribution of groundwater in the irrigated agriculture development. the dependence on groundwater has increased due to rapid growth in cropping intensity and increasing water demand. hence, to support a long term agricultural management the sustainability of groundwater largely depends on seepage from canals. this paper presents model simulation assessments of the time dependent seepage to groundwater under the crop, land and water scenarios, as a case study for a branch canal system in punjab, pakistan. assessment of seepage from canal was performed using a surface groundwater model, modflow. model calibrations were performed to obtain close agreement between the observed and simulated water levels over one year study period. the monthly average seepage rate from the canal was assessed as 12.10 m(3)/s/million m(2) for a monthly average. flow rate of 106 m(3)/s. resultantly the contribution of seepage to groundwater is based on the waterbalance components including recharge flow, applied irrigation, rainfall, lateral flow and evapotranspiration from the existing cropping system. a relationship between seepage (s) and the canal flow rate (q) was developed (s = 0.006 q(1.44)) to quantify the seepage to groundwater from the canal for any flow rate."
Asad-Uz-Zaman et al.,2006,Journal of Hydrology,improved yield from aquifers of limited saturated thickness using inverted wells,"inverted wells, in which the solid casing extends over the full depth of the permeable aquifer, but with slotted screens projecting upwards alongside the solid casing, can provide high yields in moderately transmissive aquifers for which all permeable strata are within about 30 m of the non pumping water level. the use of inverted wells has been pioneered in the rajshahi barind in northwest bangladesh. conceptual and computational models of inverted wells are developed. by examining a step pumping test using a numerical model, the important flow processes are identified and quantified. the sustainability, of the substantial groundwater abstraction in the rajshahi barind is examined by considering the recharge processes which depend on losses from flooded rice fields, the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying barind clay and the seasonal recovery of observation well water levels.

Askri et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,development and application of a conceptual hydrologic model to predict soil salinity within modern tunisian oases,"in modern oases situated in the south of tunisia, secondary salination of irrigated lands is a crucial problem. the visible salt deposits and soil salination processes are the consequence of several factors including the excessive use of saline irrigation water, seepage from earthen canal systems, inefficient irrigation practices and inadequate drainage. understanding the mechanism of the secondary salination is of interest in order to maintain existing oases, and thus ensure the sustainability of date production in this part of the country. therefore, a conceptual, daily, semi distributed hydrologic model (oasis mod) was developed to analyse the impact of irrigation management on the watertable fluctuation, soil salinity and drain discharge, and to evaluate measures to control salinity within an oasis ecosystem. the basic processes incorporated in the model are irrigation, infiltration, percolation to the shallow groundwater, soil evaporation, crop transpiration, groundwater flow, capillary rise flux, and drain discharge. oasis mod was tested with data collected in a parcel of farmland situated in the segdoud oasis, in the south west of tunisia. the calibration results showed that groundwater levels were simulated with acceptable accuracy, since the differences between the simulated and measured values are less than 0.22 in. however, the model under predicted some watertable peaks when irrigation occurs due to inconsistencies in the irrigation water data. the validation results showed that deviations between observed and simulated groundwater levels have increased to about 0.5 m due to under estimation of groundwater inflow from an upstream palm plantation. a long term simulation scenario revealed that the soil salinity and groundwater level have three types of variability in time: a daily variability due to irrigation practices, seasonal fluctuation due to climatic conditions and annual variability explained by the increase in cultivated areas. the irrigation interval was found to be important with irrigating once each ten days leading to soil salinity increase during the dry summer season and to a rising watertable during the autumn winter period. the annual increase in the irrigated area caused a decrease of the irrigation water depths, and thus an augmentation of the soil and groundwater salinities. the surface area affected by a soil salinity concentration above 15 g/l has increased from 2% of the study parcel area in june 1992 to about 50% four years later due to the abandonment of several cultivated basins.

Baalousha et al.,2010,Agricultural Water Management,"assessment of a groundwater quality monitoring network using vulnerability mapping and geostatistics: a case study from heretaunga plains, new zealand","a groundwater monitoring network can provide quantity and quality data necessary to make informed decisions regarding the state of the environment. a properly designed monitoring system provides a representative understanding of the state of the monitored area. the selection of the optimum number of monitoring sites and their spatial distribution is a major challenge for the hydrogeologist. on the one hand, improper distribution of monitoring sites or insufficient number of sites will not provide a representative view of the state of the environment. on the other hand, if the sampled sites are too many, the information obtained is redundant and the monitoring network is costly and inefficient. a new methodology combining vulnerability mapping and geostatistics is proposed to help define the most efficient groundwater quality monitoring network on a regional scale. vulnerability mapping identifies areas with high pollution potential, and in turn, prioritises for monitoring. a geostatistics methodology is then used to interpret the obtained data and to examine the spatial distribution of monitored parameters at different sites. the accuracy of spatial mapping reflects the effectiveness of the distribution of the monitoring sites. the methodology was applied to assess the nitrate monitoring network in the heretaunga basin, hawke's bay, new zealand. the drastic approach was used to prepare a vulnerability map for the area of study, and kriging variance was used to check the spatial distribution of the sites. based on this study, it was found that some areas with high vulnerability are not covered within the existing network indicating the number of monitoring sites and their distribution is not efficient. some sites should be dropped and some others need to be added to the existing network.

Bahramian et al.,2007,Journal of Theoretical Biology,coupling of transcription termination to rnai,"in metazoans, the mechanisms of transcriptional termination by rna polymerase ii (pol ii) and accelerated decay of messenger rna (mrna) following transcription shutdown are linked by sharing the same sequence elements and mrna elongation, processing and termination factors. this begs the question, how could one process have two opposite outcomes, making or degrading mrna? an integrated ""allosteric genei torpedo"" model that could explain this paradox predicts participation of two novel factors: (1) an allosteric factor, regulated by a physiological repressor, binds to a unique sequence element of a gene near the site of cleavage and polyadenylation, poly(a) site, and acts on the homologous site on the nascent transcript to cause its cleavage. the conformational changes of this factor determine the fate of nascent rna, either to get cleaved and processed to mature mrna for directing protein synthesis, or not to get cleaved and become template for double stranded (ds) rna synthesis. (2) a general transcription termination factor, recruited by transcribing pol iit the poly(a) site, allostrically alters and induces pol iio switch template from dna to nascent rna several hundred nucleotides downstream of the poly(a) site. the template switch disengages pol iirom dna and effectively terminates transcription. the pol ii with newly acquired rna dependent rna polymerase activity retraces its path, back along the nascent rna, so generating dsrna. the extent to which it can retrace this path is determined by the factors influencing the cleavage of the pre mrna at the site of polya addition. if cleavage and polyadenylation occur, the retracing is cut short, the 3' rna is degraded by an exonuclease and the polymerase is liberated to reinitiate transcription. if the cleavage is inhibited, then a full length dsrna can be produced. this can then be subject to cleavage by ""dicer"", which generates fragments of similar to 22 bp that guide degradation of the cognate mrna via the rna interference (rnai) pathway. this model complements the current ""allosteric torpedo"" model of transcription termination, and could explain the apparent paradox of the divergent results of a common biological process.

Banerjee et al.,2009,Environmental Geology,forecasting of groundwater level in hard rock region using artificial neural network,"in hardrock terrain where seasonal streams are not perennial source of freshwater, increase in groundwater exploitation has already resulted here in declining groundwater levels and deteriorating its' quality. the aquifer system has shown signs of depletion and quality contamination. thus, to secure water for the future, water resource estimation and management has urgently become the need of the hour. in order to manage groundwater resources, it is vital to have a tool to predict the aquifer response for a given stress (abstraction and recharge). artificial neural network (ann) has surfaced as a proven and potential methodology to forecast the groundwater levels. in this paper, feed forward network based ann model is used as a method to predict the groundwater levels. the models are trained with the inputs collected from field and then used as prediction tool for various scenarios of stress on aquifer. such predictions help in developing better strategies for sustainable development of groundwater resources."

Batelaan et al.,2007,Journal of Hydrology,gis based recharge estimation by coupling surface subsurfacewaterbalances,"a spatially distributed waterbalance model is developed to simulate tong term average recharge depending on land cover, soil texture, topography and hydrometeorological parameters. the model simulates recharge iteratively connected to a groundwater model, such that the recharge estimate is also influenced by the groundwater depth and vice versa. parameter estimation for the model is performed on the basis of literature values of waterbalance fluxes from mainly belgium and the netherlands. by graphical and non linear baseflow separation for 17 catchments it is shown that recharge spatially varies considerably. the waterbalance model coupled to a regional groundwater model is applied and successfully tested on the 17 catchments. the application shows that the resulting recharge has a spatial complex pattern, depending to a large extend on the soil texture and land cover. moreover, shallow groundwater levels in valleys cause negative recharge conditions as a result of evapotranspiration by abundant phreatophytic vegetation. gis analysis shows how recharge strongly varies for different combinations of land cover and soil texture classes. the performed analysis provides a better insight into the sustenance and management of groundwater resources.

Bertrand et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,"identification of different groundwater flowpaths within volcanic aquifers using natural tracers for the evaluation of the influence of lava flows morphology (argnat basin, chaine des puys, france)","hydrochemical and stable isotopic (h 2, o 18) data were used to characterize the groundwater flow and major chemical features within a complex fractured volcanic aquifer system, the argnat basin, which is located in the chaine des puys (french massif central). from 10 sampling points, the study of the transfer into the saturated zone from upstream to downstream, given the geological context and topography, allows to estimate the role of supply from high and low altitudes to the recharge processes. this work shows the existence of different types of supply between pahoehoe and a'a flows. therefore, the morphology of volcanic flows impacts the chemical and isotopic signatures of groundwater, enhancing or reducing the influence of the unsaturated zone on the pathways of infiltrated water. pahoehoe flows imply horizontal water flows of low discharge at the top of the lava whereas a'a flows seems to be much more heterogeneous and locally able to promote the existence of perched water bodies and further vertical circulations. taking into account these two types of behaviour, a conceptual scheme of the functioning of this heterogeneous environment is proposed, which will help towards a sustainable management of volcanic aquifers in relation with the european union groundwater directive (2006/118/ce) (2006).

Bouchaou et al.,2009,Journal of Hydrology,origin and residence time of groundwater in the tadla basin (morocco) using multiple isotopic and geochemical tools,"groundwater resources in the tadla basin stem from surfacewater recharge and different groundwater inflows, forming a multilayered aquifer system, which hosts one of morocco's most important groundwater reservoirs. the hydrodynamic infrastructure; i.e. the relationship between all regional aquifers, recharge, and the residence time of waters poses a serious challenge for current water management and future exploitation in aiming for a long term sustainable utilization. a combined hydrogeologic and isotopic investigation using hydrochemical and isotopic tracers such as (18)o, (2)h, (3)h, (13)c and (14)c was carried out in order to determine the sources of water recharge to the aquifers, the groundwater flow system, and the residence time of these waters. more than one hundred point measurements throughout the study area in varying wells, boreholes, springs and rivers were investigated. chemical compositions of the groundwater indicate an important influence by the host carbonate rocks from each of the tadla aquifers. stable isotope results indicate the existence of two groups of groundwater corresponding to the unconfined aquifer in the north and the confined aquifer in the south. the delta(18)o, delta(2)h, (3)h, and (14)c data indicate that the high atlas mountains in the south and east of the basin, which are characterized by high rainfall and low delta(18)o and delta(2)h values, are currently the major source of recharge for the tadla aquifers. a significant recharge zone lies in the northern part of the basin where all the aquifers outcrop. the confined zones show depleted (18)o values, corresponding to the signature of recharge water from the atlas mountains. moreover, all isotope data demonstrated clearly that the tassaout springs, which are located in the southwest of the basin and were previously interpreted as representing natural outlet of the deep aquifers, are comprised of young waters with depleted (18)o and (2)h signatures, suggesting a high altitude recharge from the atlas mountain. in contrast, the unconfined parts of the aquifers show higher values of delta(18)o, indicating an evaporation phenomenon, which occurs during infiltration or recharge from irrigation. the mixing process of old and recent waters is confirmed by (14)c and (3)h. the isotopic data also indicates probable interaction and flow between the different aquifers. the isotopic and hydrochemical data is therefore essential in confirming possible mixing relationships between aquifers whereas traditional hydraulic data is not capable to provide a quantitative assessment of these relationships. the data generated in this study will certainly encourage the revision and improvement of the current hydrological water resources model for the tadla basin. the results provide a framework for development of a comprehensive management plan in which water exploitation shifts towards areas with modern recharge and where young and high quality groundwater is found.

Boulton et al.,2008,Invertebrate Systematics,"biodiversity, functional roles and ecosystem services of groundwater invertebrates","recent surveys of groundwater invertebrates (stygofauna) worldwide are yielding rich troves of biodiversity, with significant implications for invertebrate systematists and phylogeneticists as well as ecologists and groundwater managers. what is the ecological significance of this high biodiversity of invertebrates in some aquifers? how might it influence groundwater ecosystem services such as water purification or bioremediation? in terrestrial ecosystems, biodiversity is typically positively correlated with rates of ecosystem functions beneficial to humans (e. g. crop pollination). however, the links between biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem services in groundwater are unknown. in some aquifers, feeding, movement and excretion by diverse assemblages of stygofauna potentially enhance groundwater ecosystem services such as water purification, bioremediation and water infiltration. further, as specific taxa apparently play 'keystone' roles in facilitating ecosystem services, declines in abundance or even their extinction have serious repercussions. one way to assess the functional significance of biodiversity is to identify 'ecosystem service providers', characterise their functional relationships, determine how service provision is affected by community structure and environmental variables, and measure the spatio temporal scales over which these operate. examples from australian and new zealand alluvial aquifers reveal knowledge gaps in understanding the functional importance of most stygofauna, hampering effective protection of currently undervalued groundwater ecosystem services."
Brandenberger et al.,2004,Applied Geochemistry,geochemical and hydrodynamic controls on arsenic and trace metal cycling in a seasonally stratified us sub tropical reservoir,"the phase distribution of trace metals and oxyanions, including u and as, in 2 surfacewater bodies was investigated within a south texas watershed hosting a high density of surface u mine pits and tailings. the objectives of the study were to evaluate the environmental legacy of u mining, with particular emphasis on the spatial and temporal variability of water quality in lake corpus christi, a downstream reservoir that serves as the major water resource to a population of similar to350,000 people in the region. lyssy pond, a livestock pond bordered by u mine tailings, was used as a model case study site to evaluate the cycling of u mine derived oxyanions under changing redox conditions. although the pond showed seasonal thermal and chemical stratification, geochemical cycling of metals was limited to co and pb, which was correlated with redox cycling of mn mineral phases, and u, which suggested reductive precipitation in the pond's hypolimnion. uranium levels, however, were too low to support strong inputs from the tailings into the water column of the pond. the strong relationships observed between particulate cr, cs, v, and fe suggest that these metals are associated with a stable particulate phase (probably allochthonous alumino silicates) enriched in unreactive fe. this observation is supported by a parallel relationship in sediments collected across a broad range of sediment depositional processes (and histories) in the basin. arsenic, though selectively enriched in the pond's water column, was dominated by dissolved species throughout the depth of the profile and showed no sign of geochemical cycling or interaction with fe rich particles. arsenic (and other oxyanions) in the water columns of lake corpus christi and lyssy pond were not affected by the abundant presence of fe rich particles but instead behaved conservatively. no evidence was found of anthropogenic impacts of u mines beyond the purely local scale. arsenic's presence within the nueces drainage basin is related to interactions between surface and groundwaters with u  and as rich geological formations rather than large scale transport of contaminants downstream of the u mine pits and tailings. a quantitative mass balance model, constructed using monthly hydrological data for the reservoir, provides quantitative evidence of seasonal evaporative concentration of as in surfacewaters demonstrating the predominance of hydrodynamic over geochemical constraints, on the cycling of this element.

Braune et al.,2010,Ground Water,the role of groundwater in sub saharan africa,"although water resources managers speak of a water crisis in africa, the management of groundwater has to date not featured strongly in national and regional african water agendas. examination of the physical environment of the continent and, in particular, the water resources in relation to the socioeconomic landscape and regional development challenges makes it clear that widely occurring, albeit largely low yielding, groundwater resources will be crucial in the achievement of water security and development. groundwater is important primarily in domestic water and sanitation services, but also for other local productive needs like community gardens, stock watering, and brick making, all essential to secure a basic livelihood and thus to alleviate poverty. despite the importance of small scale farming in africa, there is little information on the present and potential role of groundwater in agriculture. in contrast to its socioeconomic and ecological importance, groundwater has remained a poorly understood and managed resource. widespread contamination of groundwater resources is occurring, and the important environmental services of groundwater are neglected. there appear to be critical shortcomings in the organizational framework and the building of institutional capacity for groundwater. addressing this challenge will require a much clearer understanding and articulation of groundwater's role and contribution to national and regional development objectives and an integrated management framework, with top down facilitation of local actions."

Brikowski et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrology,"doomed reservoirs in kansas, usa? climate change and groundwater mining on the great plains lead to unsustainable surfacewater storage","streamflow declines on the great plains of the us are causing many federal reservoirs to become profoundly inefficient, and will eventually drive them into unsustainability as negative annual reservoir waterbudgets become more common. the streamflow declines are historically related to groundwater mining, but since the mid 1980s correlate increasingly with climate. this study highlights that progression toward unsustainability, and shows that future climate change wilt continue streamflow declines at historical rates, with severe consequences for surfacewater supply. an object lesson is optima lake in the oklahoma panhandle, where streamflows have declined 99% since the 1960s and the reservoir has never been more than 5% full. waterbalances for the four westernmost federal reservoirs in kansas (cedar bluff, keith sebelius, webster and kirwin) show similar tendencies. for these four, reservoir inflow has declined by 92%, 73%, 81% and 64% respectively since the 1950s. since 1990 total evaporated volumes relative to total inflows amounted to 68%, 83%, 24% and 44% respectively. predictions of streamflow and reservoir performance based on climate change models indicate 70% chance of steady decline after 2007, with a similar to 50% chance of failure (releases by gravity flow impossible) of cedar bluff reservoir between 2007 and 2050. paradoxically, a 30% chance of storage increase prior 2020 is indicated, followed by steady declines through 2100. within 95% confidence the models predict > 50% decline in surfacewater resources between 2007 and 2050. ultimately, surface storage of water resources may prove unsustainable in this region, forcing conversion to subsurface storage.

Brkic et al.,2010,Geologia Croatica,the quantitative status of groundwater in alluvial aquifers in norther croatia,"the quantity and spatial distribution of groundwater in croatia is determined by geological composition, climate and hydrological conditions and the hydrogeological characteristics of individual areas. northern croatia is part of the southern margin of the pannonian basin and is dominated by the spacious lowlands of the sava and drava rivers, where aquifers of intergranular porosity of pleistocene and holocene ages were formed. the lithological composition of the aquifers is dominated by gravel and sand in the western parts of the drava and sava basins. sandy aquifers are prevalent in the central and eastern parts. groundwater accumulated in these aquifers is the basis of the water supply in northern croatia, which is the reason why monitoring of its status, both quantitative and qualitative is exceptionally important. data obtained by long term monitoring of groundwater levels facilitated assessment of the quantitative status of groundwater. to determine the causes of changes in the hydrodynamic conditions of the aquifers, results of long term monitoring of precipitation and stages of the drava and sava rivers were also used. linear regression was used to analyse changes in groundwater levels, the drava and sava river stages and precipitation quantities. the results generally show that there is a negative groundwater level trend over almost the entire area of the drava and sava alluvial aquifer. this is a consequence of deepening of the drava and sava river beds and lowering of their stages, together with a decreasing trend of total annual precipitation."

Brunner et al.,2009,Water Resources Research,hydrogeologic controls on disconnection between surfacewater and groundwater,"understanding how changes in the groundwatertable affect surfacewater resources is of fundamental importance in quantitative hydrology. if the groundwatertable below a stream is sufficiently deep, changes in the groundwatertable position effectively do not alter the infiltration rate. this is referred to as a disconnected system. previous authors noted that a low conductivity layer below the surfacewater body is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for disconnection to occur. we develop a precise criterion that allows an assessment of whether surfacewater groundwater systems can disconnect or not. we further demonstrate that a disconnected system can be conceptualized by a saturated groundwater mound and the development of a capillary zone above this mound. this conceptualization is used to determine the critical watertable position at the point where full disconnection is reached. a comparison of this calculated critical watertable position with a measurement of the watertable depth in a borehole allows the assessment of the disconnection status. a sensitivityanalysis of this critical watertable showed that for a given aquifer thickness and river width, the depth to groundwater where the system disconnects is approximately proportional to the stream depth and the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed sediments and inversely proportional to the thickness of these sediments and the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. the conceptualization also allows the disconnection problem to be analyzed using both variably saturated and fully saturated groundwater models and provides guidance for numerical and analytical approaches."

Calzadilla et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,the economic impact of more sustainable water use in agriculture: a computable general equilibrium analysis,"agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater resources   around 70 percent of all freshwater withdrawals are used for food production. these agricultural products are traded internationally. a full understanding of water use is, therefore, impossible without understanding the international market for food and related products, such as textiles. based on the global general equilibrium model gtap w, we offer a method for investigating the role of green (rain) and blue (irrigation) water resources in agriculture and within the context of international trade. we use future projections of allowable water withdrawals for surfacewater and groundwater to define two alternative water management scenarios. the first scenario explores a deterioration of current trends and policies in the water sector (water crisis scenario). the second scenario assumes an improvement in policies and trends in the water sector and eliminates groundwater overdraft world wide, increasing water allocation for the environment (sustainable water use scenario). in both scenarios, welfare gains or losses are not only associated with changes in agricultural water consumption. under the water crisis scenario, welfare not only rises for regions where water consumption increases (china, south east asia and the usa). welfare gains are considerable for japan and south korea, southeast asia and western europe as well. these regions benefit from higher levels of irrigated production and lower food prices. alternatively, under the sustainable water use scenario, welfare losses not only affect regions where overdrafting is occurring. welfare decreases in other regions as well. these results indicate that, for water use, there is a clear trade off between economic welfare and environmental sustainability.

Cloutier et al.,2010,Environmental Earth Sciences,desalination of a sedimentary rock aquifer system invaded by pleistocene champlain sea water and processes controlling groundwater geochemistry,"the objective of this study was to identify geochemical processes and quaternary geological events responsible for the variations in groundwater geochemistry observed in a sedimentary rock aquifer system, including brackish to saline groundwater. inorganic constituents and environmental isotopes were analyzed for 146 groundwater samples. dissolution of carbonates dominates in recharge areas, resulting in ca , mg hco(3) groundwater. further along flow paths, under confined conditions, ca(2+) na(+) ion exchange causes groundwater evolution to na hco(3) type. na cl groundwater is also found and it falls on a seawater mixing line. using conservative tracers, cl( ) and br( ), the original champlain sea water is shown to have been, in the region, a mixture of about 34% seawater and 66% freshwater, a composition still retained by some groundwater. na cl groundwater thus results from mixing with former champlain sea water and also from solute diffusion from overlying marine clay. the system is thus found to be at different stages of desalinization, from the original champlain sea water still present in hydraulically stagnant areas of the aquifer to fully flushed conditions in parts, where more flow occurs, especially in recharge zones. the geochemical processes are integrated within the hydrogeological context to produce a conceptual geochemical evolution model for groundwater of the aquifer system."
Cloutier et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrology,multivariate statistical analysis of geochemical data as indicative of the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in a sedimentary rock aquifer system,"the study of groundwater hydrogeochemistry of the paleozoic basses laurentides sedimentary rock aquifer system in quebec produced a large geochemical dataset. groundwater samples were collected at 153 sites over a 1500 km(2) study area and analyzed for major and minor ions. the large number of data can lead to difficulties in the integration, interpretation and representation of the results. two multivariate statistical methods, hierarchical cluster analysis (hca) and principal components analysis (pca), were applied to a subgroup of the dataset to evaluate their usefulness to classify the groundwater samples, and to identify geochemical processes controlling groundwater geochemistry. this subgroup consisted of 144 samples and 14 parameters (ca2+, mg2+, na+, k+, hco3 , cl , so42 , fe2+, mn2+, br , sr2+, f , ba2+, hs  ). seven geochemically distinct clusters , c1 c7, resulted from the hca. samples from clusters c3, c4, c6 and c7 are mostly located in preferential recharge areas. the majority of these samples have ca mg hco3 recharge groundwater (c3, c6, c7) and na hco3 evolved groundwater (c4). samples from the other three clusters (c1, c2, c5) are characteristic of an aquifer system under confined conditions. the majority of these samples have na hco3 evolved groundwater (c1, c5) and na cl ancient groundwater that exhibits elevated concentrations in br (c2). in addition to recognizing the importance of hydrogeological conditions on groundwater geochemistry, the distribution of clusters also showed the importance of the geological formations on minor and trace elements, such as fe2+, mn2+, sr2+, f  and ba2+. the first five components of the pca account for 78.3% of the total variance in the dataset. component 1 is defined by highly positive loadings in na+, cl  and br  and is related to groundwater mixing with champlain sea water and solute diffusion from the marine clay aquitard. the high positive loadings in ca2+ and mg2+ of component 2 suggest the importance of dissolution of carbonate rocks in this aquifer system. from their characteristic loadings, the first two components are defined as the ""salinity"" and ""hardness"" components, respectively. components 3 5 are related to more local and geological effects. the integration of the hca and the pca, with conventional classification of groundwater types, as well. as with the hydrogeological and geological contexts, allowed the division of the region into four main geochemical areas, providing an improved regional picture of the aquifer system dynamics and hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater. the following factors were recognized as influencing the evolution of groundwater identified in every geochemical area: (1) geological characteristics including sedimentary rock type and till mineralogy; (2) hydrogeological characteristics represented by the level of confinement and the hydraulic gradient; and (3) the geological history including the latest glaciation and the champlain sea invasion. with its integrated approach, this hydrogeochemical study contributes to the characterization and understanding of complex groundwater flow systems, and provides an example of the long term geochemical evolution of hydrogeological systems after a major perturbation in this case seawater invasion.

Collin et al.,2003,Journal of Cleaner Production,assessing groundwater vulnerability to pollution to promote sustainable urban and rural development,"groundwater resource management should be integrated with regional landuse planning. the objectives of such planning should respond to regional and long term design needs, which can maximize human life quality, achieve a balance between ecological and engineering approaches to landuse alteration, and lead to sustainable groundwater resources. regional plans should be designed in harmony with natural amenities, restrictions of the environment, and water needs so as to provide adequate rural amenities to urban areas and adequate urban amenities to rural areas. maximum efficiency of these remediation measures can be attained in urban areas only if hydrological barriers which aim to preserve fresh water resources from pollution are simultaneously emplaced with greenbelts which not only aim to promote ground vegetation and soil stability, but also reduce the input of potential pollutants. similarly, in rural areas abstraction of fresh groundwater should also be paired with aquifer recharge. from this study it can be stated that only integrated hydrological, environmental, and landuse measures could offset the present malaise of inharmonious landuse, water resources, and socio economic planning with balanced design needs, in order to achieve integrated urban/rural landuse for sustainable groundwater resources planning.

Counce et al.,2009,Agronomy Journal,a model to predict safe stages of development for rice field draining and field tests of the model predictions in the arkansas grand prairie,"due to the cost of extracting water, effective and efficient utilization of irrigation water for rice (oryza sativa l.) is critical to rice farm profitability. the objective of this study is to predict safe stages of development for draining rice. this objective has the potential of saving rice farmers water. a computer program has been developed to predict the stage of development for draining water from rice field soils at which the risk of reduced grain yield or milling quality from insufficient water is considered to be near zero. the parameters of the model are predictions of (i) temperature during rice reproductive growth stages (rrgs) starting at r3, (ii) timing of various rrgs, (iii) maximum amount of water used by the rice crop at each growth stage, and (iv) the water held in the soil profile after draining which is available to the rice crop. the central goals of the model are to allow draining at an rrgs in which (a) the danger of reducing yield and quality from water deficits is at a minimum and (b) water is conserved and land conditions for harvest are improved. experiments to test the predictions were conducted in 2005 and 2006 at two arkansas locations: gillett and stuttgart. an experiment was also conducted at dewitt, ar, in 2006. draining at stages of development predicted by the model did not affect yield milling quality relative to the control for any year or location. predicted water savings from reduced irrigation ranged between $10.26 to $55.44 ha( 1) depending on pump depth. implementation of the program can save money, reduce tillage costs, and reduce unnecessary depletion of the aquifers."
Croteau et al.,2010,Canadian Water Resources Journal,groundwater recharge assessment in the chateauguay river watershed,"the objective of this study was to evaluate groundwater recharge in the chateauguay river watershed. the hydrologic evaluation of landfill performance (help) model was used to assess daily values of recharge, evapotranspiration and runoff. the study area was divided into a regular grid, 250 m x 250 m, for a total of 47,616 grid elements.the input parameters included soil physical properties, landuse, vegetation and climate data. calibration of help was carried out against runoff and baseflow estimates obtained from separation of five river hydrographs. over a 39 year period, the mean annual recharge rate was estimated at 86 mm, or 9% of the total precipitation. areas characterized by high water level elevations and unconfined flow conditions were identified as the main recharge areas. daily estimates show that recharge takes place mainly in spring and fall. over the observed period, the annual variations of evapotranspiration and runoff were directly related to changes in precipitation, whereas the annual recharge response was subdued, with much lower variations. help was also used to assess potential climate change scenarios using data for the driest and most humid years. the mean annual recharge was 51 mm for the driest year and 99 mm for the most humid year. differences in the spatial distribution of recharge for the predictive scenarios indicate that the areas most sensitive to climate change correspond to the preferential recharge areas."
Currell et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,"recharge history and controls on groundwater quality in the yuncheng basin, north china","environmental isotopes and water quality indicators (e.g. tds and no(3) contents) were used to characterize the age, recharge history and controls on the quality of groundwater resources in the yuncheng basin, north china, where extensive extraction occurs for agriculture and domestic supply. delta(18)o and delta(2)h values as low as  10.6%. and  73 parts per thousand, respectively, together with low radiocarbon activities (<20 pmc) show that deep groundwater comprises palaeowaters largely recharged in the late pleistocene (similar to 10 to 22 ka b.p.) under a cooler climate than the present. shallow groundwater has higher radiocarbon activities (>70 pmc), indicating a significant component of modern (post 1950s) recharge. the shallow groundwater has higher delta(18)o and delta(2)h values (up to  8.1%. and  54 parts per thousand) that are similar to those in modern summer monsoon rainfall, indicating that current recharge is via direct infiltration and/or leakage of ephemeral streams during heavy rain events. historic recharge rates estimated using radiocarbon ages are between 1 and 10 mm/year, corresponding to <2% of local rainfall, which is lower than estimates of modern recharge nearby based on tritium data. the relationship between groundwater delta(18)o values and (14)c ages is similar to that observed in groundwater from other basins in northern china, confirming that much deep groundwater in the region is palaeowater, and suggesting that a broad scale assessment of groundwater residence times may be made from delta(18)o and delta(2)h values. most deep groundwater has low tds and nitrate concentrations (median 1090 mg/l and 1.8 mg/l, respectively), while shallow groundwater has tds contents of up to 8450 mg/l (median 2010 mg/l) and no(3) concentrations up to 630 mg/l (median 31 mg/l). a lack of enrichment in delta(18)o values in the high salinity shallow groundwater indicates that transpiration by crops and possibly minor mineral dissolution are the major salinisation processes, rather than evaporation or leakage from salt lakes. the majority of nitrate in groundwater has delta(15)n (no3) values between 0.8 parts per thousand and 5.0 parts per thousand and delta(18)o(no3) values between 1.8 parts per thousand and 4.1 parts per thousand, indicating that synthetic fertilizers are the main source of elevated no(3) concentrations. increasing residence times from east to west in deep groundwaters reflect the historic regional flow pattern in the basin. however, present day flow is now dictated by a large cone of depression that has formed due to intensive deep groundwater pumping since the 1980s. high downward vertical hydraulic gradients (up to 0.45) have also developed as a result of this pumping, promoting downwards leakage of shallow water, indicated by high nitrate concentrations (>20 mg/l) in some deep wells (>180 m). preferential leakage has occurred near the linyi fault, in the northern sushui river basin. salinisation, nitrate contamination and excessive drawdown of deep groundwater are major concerns for the future of the groundwater resources in this region.

Custodio et al.,2002,Hydrogeology Journal,aquifer overexploitation: what does it mean?,"groundwater overexploitation and aquifer overexploitation are terms that are becoming common in water re sources management. hydrologists. managers and journalists use them when talking about stressed aquifers or some groundwater conflict. overexploitation may be defined as the situation in which, for sonic years, average aquifer abstraction rate is, greater than. or close to the average recharge rate. but rate and extent of recharge areas are often very uncertain. besides, they may be modified by human activities and aquifer development. in practice, however, an aquifer is often considered as overexploited when some persistent negative results of aquifer development are felt or perceived. such as a continuous water level drawdown. progressive water quality deterioration, increase of abstraction cost. or ecological damage. but negative results do not necessarily imply that abstraction is greater than recharge. they may be simply due to well interferences and the long transient period that follow changes in the aquifer waterbalance. groundwater storage is depleted to some extent during the transient period after abstraction is increased. its duration depends on aquifer size. specific storage and permeability. which level of ""aquifer overexploitation"" is advisable or bearable. depends oil the detailed and updated consideration of aquifer development effects and the measures implemented for correction. this should not be the result of applying general rules based on sonic indirect data. monitoring. sound aquifer knowledge, and calculation or modelling, of behaviour are needed in the framework of a set of objectives and policies. they should be established by a management institution, with the involvement of groundwater stakeholders, and take into account the environmental and,octal constraints. aquifer overexploitation. which often is perceived to be associated with something ethically bad, is not necessarily detrimental if it is not permanent. it may be a,step towards sustainable development. actually, the term aquifer overexploitation is mostly a qualifier that intends to point to a concern about the evolution of the aquifer flow system in some specific, restricted points of view, but without a precise hydrodynamic meaning. implementing, groundwater management and protection meat sures needs quantitative appraisal of aquifer evolution and effects based on detailed multidisciplinary studies. which have to he supported by reliable data."
D'Haeze et al.,2005,Agricultural Water Management,"groundwater extraction for irrigation of coffea canephora in ea tul watershed, vietnam   a risk evaluation","after the reunion of north and south vietnam in 1975, the area under small holder, irrigated cultivation of coffea canephora increased by a factor of 10 in the central highlands. the actual acreage under coffee in dak lak province is estimated to be over 260,000 ha, representing 60% of the national production, with 405,000 t per year for the world market. vietnam is presently the second largest exporter worldwide and expansion is still going on. in response to farmers' alarming reports of apparent water scarcity in the dry season, this paper assesses the groundwater recharge in the ea tul watershed, a representative area in the central highlands region. the groundwater recharge is estimated by means of a steady state, waterbalance model and validated by means of historical data, stream gauge records at the basin's outlet and groundwater level fluctuations in wells nearby the study area. to account for the variability from one year to another, the input of the waterbalance equation was subjected to a frequency analysis. the estimates indicate that the expected annual groundwater recharge is 743 mm in a wet year, 517 mm in an average and 361 mm in a dry year. validation and literature reviews confirm these figures. subsequently the model is used to evaluate the issue of aquifer depletion and to verify whether a combination of optimal irrigation management and optimal land allocation for robusta coffee could solve the apparent water shortages in the coffee sector. allowing for a minimum river discharge under very dry circumstances (i.e. the q(90) of river base flow), the sustainable yield from the aquifer for variable climatic conditions is calculated. the results confirm that with the present irrigation application depths, the groundwater is likely to be depleted in dry years, but not in wet and average years. reducing the irrigation application depths could keep the groundwaterbalance positive in all years. optimization of land allocation for c canephora may offer an alternative way out. a reduction by 35% of the present coffee area in ea tul along with irrigation efficiency improvement could keep the groundwater resources in balance and guarantees a minimum river discharge, even during severe dry seasons.

Dadaser-Celik et al.,2007,Water International,hydrologic sustainability of the sultan marshes in turkey,"hydrologic changes in the sultan marshes ecosystem, a closed basin wetland in the semi arid develi basin in south central turkey, are analyzed and related to intensification of irrigated agriculture in the catchment. relationships between water level changes in the marsh, and inflows and outflows of surfacewater and groundwater are examined. since the 1980s, surface runoff from the surrounding mountains into the develi basin has been captured in three major reservoirs and used for flood irrigation. substantial declines in seasonally fluctuating water levels were recorded in the sultan marshes from 1993 to 2003. our analysis shows that these trends are related to decreases in inflows from groundwater and springs, not to climatic changes. simulations with a deterministic hydrologic model for the ortuluakar marsh, a sub system of the sultan marshes, as well as statistical analyses, showed that it is necessary to reduce water use from groundwater and springs to maintain pre 1995 marsh water levels. alternative groundwater management scenarios to sustain both the wetland and irrigated agriculture in the develi basin were tested. a 50% reduction in groundwater and spring water use for irrigation showed promising results for the sultan marshes. irrigation in the basin uses 66% surfacewater and 34 % groundwater. a 50% reduction in groundwater use for irrigation therefore represents less than 20 % of total irrigation water used. reduction in groundwater use is, however, linked to social and economic conditions in the develi basin, and incentives that encourage farmers to adopt sustainable groundwater use practices need to be developed."

Dawoud et al.,2005,Water Resources Management,gis based groundwater management model for western nile delta,"the limited availability of renewable fresh water is a major constraint on future agriculture and urban development in egypt. the main water resource that egypt has been depending on is the river nile. nowadays, the role of groundwater is steadily increasing and will cover 20% of the total water supply in the coming decades especially in the reclaimed areas along the desert fringes of the nile delta and valley. abstraction from groundwater in egypt is dynamic in nature as it grows rapidly with the expansion of irrigation activities, industrialization, and urbanization. one of these areas is the western nile delta in which the groundwater is exploited in many localities. to avoid the deterioration of the aquifer system in this area, an efficient integrated and sustainable management plan for groundwater resources is needed. efficient integrated and sustainable management of water resources relies on a comprehensive database that represents the characteristics of the aquifer system and modeling tools to achieve the impacts of decision alternatives. in this paper, a gis based model has been developed for the aquifer system of the western nile delta. the gis provides the utilization of analytical tools and visualization capabilities for pre and post processing information involved in groundwater modeling for the study area. the developed model was calibrated for steady state and transient conditions against the historical groundwater heads observed during the last 20 yr. the calibrated model was used to evaluate groundwater potentiality and to test two alternative management scenarios for conserving the aquifer system in western nile delta. in the first scenario, reducing the surfacewater inflow while increasing the annual abstraction from groundwater by about 450 million m(3) and improving the irrigation system could increase the net aquifer recharge by about 5.7% and reduce the aquifer potentiality by about 91%. constructing a new canal as a second management scenario could increase the annual aquifer potentiality by about 23%. the gis based model has been proven to be an efficient tool for formulating integrated and sustainable management plan."

Devlin et al.,2005,Hydrogeology Journal,the persistence of the waterbudget myth and its relationship to sustainability,"sustainability and sustainable pumping are two different concepts that are often used interchangeably. the latter term refers to a pumping rate that can be maintained indefinitely without mining an aquifer, whereas the former term is broader and concerns such issues as ecology and water quality, among others, in addition to sustainable pumping. another important difference between the two concepts is that recharge can be very important to consider when assessing sustainability, but is not necessary to estimate sustainable pumping rates. confusion over this distinction is made worse by the waterbudget myth, which comprises the mistaken yet persistent ideas that (1) sustainable pumping rates cannot exceed virgin recharge rates in aquifers, and (2) that virgin recharge rates must therefore be known to estimate sustainable pumping rates. analysis of the waterbalance equation shows the special circumstances that must apply for the waterbudget myth to be true. however, due to the effects recharge is likely to have on water quality, ecology, socioeconomic factors, and, under certain circumstances, its requirement for numerical modeling, it remains important in assessments of sustainability."

Dewandel et al.,2005,Hydrogeology Journal,a conceptual hydrogeological model of ophiolite hard rock aquifers in oman based on a multiscale and a multidisciplinary approach,"ophiolites are found all over the world: from the alps to the himalayas, in cuba, papua new guinea, new caledonia, newfoundland, etc. they are composed of hard rocks basalt, dolerite, gabbro and peridotite, which are formed at the mid oceanic ridges, with specific ridge related tectonic fracturing and intense hydrothermal alteration. their geological and thus their hydrogeological properties differ from those of both granite or ""classical"" gabbro and ""classical"" basaltic lava. a conceptual hydrogeological model of these hard rock aquifers was developed based on the convergent results of a multidisciplinary approach at several spatial scales, from rock sample (centimetre) to catchment (kilometre), on well preserved ophiolite rocks in oman. in ophiolite rocks, groundwater circulation takes place mostly in the fissured near surface horizon (approximate to 50 m thick), and, to a lesser degree, in the tectonic fractures. hydrograph analysis (water resour res 34:233 240, 1977), interpretation of numerous pumping tests using both classical theis and dual porosity models [water resour res 32:2733 2745, 1996; comput geosci j (in press)], and mercury porosity and hydraulic conductivity lab measurements support the aquifer parameter estimates. the hydraulic conductivity k of the fissured horizon is estimated at 10( 5) to 10( 6) m/s for gabbro and dolerite, and 10( 7) m/s for peridotite. the storage coefficient s of the peridotite aquifer is estimated at 10( 3) and appears to be controlled mainly by microcracks (20 to 100 mu m wide). tectonic fractures in the ophiolite have similar hydrodynamic properties regardless of lithology (10( 1) t < 10<( 4) m(2)/s and 10( 1)< s < 10( 3)) though the probability of obtaining productive wells is two to three times greater in gabbro and dolerite than in peridotite. some of the tectonic fractures produce small hydrothermal, hyperalkaline springs in the peridotite. the waterbudget and hydrochemistry of the oman ophiolite are characterized and support the conceptual hydrogeological model. despite low annual rainfall, a relatively low hydraulic conductivity and a significant storage coefficient explain why most of the streams in peridotite are perennial."

Doll et al.,2008,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,global scale modeling of groundwater recharge,"long term average groundwater recharge, which is equivalent to renewable groundwater resources, is the major limiting factor for the sustainable use of groundwater. compared to surfacewater resources, groundwater resources are more protected from pollution, and their use is less restricted by seasonal and inter annual flow variations. to support water management in a globalized world, it is necessary to estimate groundwater recharge at the global scale. here, we present a best estimate of global scale long term average diffuse groundwater recharge (i.e. renewable groundwater resources) that has been calculated by the most recent version of the watergap global hydrology model wghm (spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees, daily time steps). the estimate was obtained using two state of the art global data sets of gridded observed precipitation that we corrected for measurement errors, which also allowed to quantify the uncertainty due to these equally uncertain data sets. the standard wghm groundwater recharge algorithm was modified for semi arid and arid regions, based on independent estimates of diffuse groundwater recharge, which lead to an unbiased estimation of groundwater recharge in these regions. wghm was tuned against observed long term average river discharge at 1235 gauging stations by adjusting, individually for each basin, the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and total runoff. we estimate that global groundwater recharge was 12 666 km(3)/yr for the climate normal 1961 1990, i.e. 32% of total renewable water resources. in semi arid and arid regions, mountainous regions, permafrost regions and in the asian monsoon region, groundwater recharge accounts for a lower fraction of total runoff, which makes these regions particularly vulnerable to seasonal and inter annual precipitation variability and water pollution. average per capita renewable groundwater resources of countries vary between 8m(3)/(capita yr) for egypt to more than 1 millionm(3)/(capita yr) for the falkland islands, the global average in the year 2000 being 2091 m(3)/(capita yr). regarding the uncertainty of estimated groundwater resources due to the two precipitation data sets, deviation from the mean is 1.1% for the global value, and less than 1% for 50 out of the 165 countries considered, between 1 and 5% for 62, between 5 and 20% for 43 and between 20 and 80% for 10 countries. deviations at the grid scale can be much larger, ranging between 0 and 186 mm/yr."
Doll et al.,2009,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,global scale analysis of river flow alterations due to water withdrawals and reservoirs,"global scale information on natural river flows and anthropogenic river flow alterations is required to identify areas where aqueous ecosystems are expected to be strongly degraded. such information can support the identification of environmental flow guidelines and a sustainable water management that balances the water demands of humans and ecosystems. this study presents the first global assessment of the anthropogenic alteration of river flow regimes, in particular of flow variability, by water withdrawals and dams/reservoirs. six ecologically relevant flow indicators were quantified using an improved version of the global water model watergap. watergap simulated, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree, river discharge as affected by human water withdrawals and dams around the year 2000, as well as naturalized discharge without this type of human interference. compared to naturalized conditions, long term average global discharge into oceans and internal sinks has decreased by 2.7% due to water withdrawals, and by 0.8% due to dams. mainly due to irrigation, long term average river discharge and statistical low flow q(90) (monthly river discharge that is exceeded in 9 out of 10 months) have decreased by more than 10% on one sixth and one quarter of the global land area (excluding antarctica and greenland), respectively. q(90) has increased significantly on only 5% of the land area, downstream of reservoirs. due to both water withdrawals and reservoirs, seasonal flow amplitude has decreased significantly on one sixth of the land area, while interannual variability has increased on one quarter of the land area mainly due to irrigation. it has decreased on only 8% of the land area, in areas downstream of reservoirs where consumptive water use is low. the impact of reservoirs is likely underestimated by our study as small reservoirs are not taken into account. areas most affected by anthropogenic river flow alterations are the western and central usa, mexico, the western coast of south america, the mediterranean rim, southern africa, the semi arid and arid countries of the near east and western asia, pakistan and india, northern china and the australian murray darling basin, as well as some arctic rivers. due to a large number of uncertainties related e.g. to the estimation of water use and reservoir operation rules, the analysis is expected to provide only first estimates of river flow alterations that should be refined in the future."
Doll et al.,2003,Journal of Hydrology,a global hydrological model for deriving water availability indicators: model tuning and validation,"freshwater availability has been recognized as a global issue, and its consistent quantification not only in individual river basins but also at the global scale is required to support the sustainable use of water. the watergap global hydrology model wghm, which is a submodel of the global water use and availability model watergap 2, computes surface runoff, groundwater recharge and river discharge at a spatial resolution of 0.5degrees. wghm is based on the best global data sets currently available, and simulates the reduction of river discharge by human water consumption. in order to obtain a reliable estimate of water availability, it is tuned against observed discharge at 724 gauging stations, which represent 50% of the global land area and 70% of the actively discharging area. for 50% of these stations, the tuning of one model parameter was sufficient to achieve that simulated and observed long term average discharges agree within 1%. for the rest, however, additional corrections had to be applied to the simulated runoff and discharge values. wghm not only computes the long term average water resources of a country or a drainage basin but also water availability indicators that take into account the interannual and seasonal variability of runoff and discharge. the reliability of the modeling results is assessed by comparing observed and simulated discharges at the tuning stations and at selected other stations. the comparison shows that wghm is able to calculate reliable and meaningful indicators of water availability at a high spatial resolution. in particular, the 90% reliable monthly discharge is simulated well. therefore, wghm is suited for application in global assessments related to water security, food security and freshwater ecosystems.

El-Hakim et al.,2007,Journal of Hydrology,significance and origin of very large regulating power of some karst aquifers in the middle east. implication on karst aquifer classification,"karst aquifers are the main groundwater resource in lebanon as well as in most mediterranean countries. most of them are not exploited in a sustainable way, partly because their characteristics remain unknown. karst aquifers are so complex that the assessment of their resource and their exploitable storage requires an analysis of their whole functioning, particularly by analysing the spring hydrograph. among all various methods, the method proposed by mangin aims to characterize at the same time the recharge conditions and the storage and recession of the saturated zone by analyzing the spring hydrograph. this method defines two parameters, the infiltration delay i, and the regulating power k which are the roots of a classification of karst systems. this classification makes the distinction between karst and porous aquifers considering the value of the regulating power. k is assumed to be tower than 0.5 in karst, and between 0.5 and 1 for all other aquifers, 1 being the upper limit. the study of karst aquifers in lebanon shows values of k > 0.5, and even 1; former data from the literature show that other karst springs in middle east have comparable characteristics. in fact, what is not considered by mangin and others, k is equivalent to a mean residence time in years of water in the saturated zone. so long residence times are normally observed in poorly karstified aquifers, or containing abandoned, not functioning karstification. the geological framework in which the studied springs are located in fact shows that these aquifers have been subject to a tong, complex evolution, as a consequence of the base level rising. this rising produced the flooding of the successive karst drainage network, which does not really function anymore and provides a large storage capacity to the aquifer. the very interesting properties of these aquifers make them prime targets for fulfilling the increasing needs of water.

Gido et al.,2010,Journal of the North American Benthological Society,retrospective analysis of fish community change during a half century of landuse and streamflow changes,"ecological thresholds that lead to alternative community states can be exceeded through gradual perturbation or as a result of sudden disturbance. many great plains streams have experienced dramatic changes in their hydrologic regime resulting from water and landuse changes that began as early as 1880. these changes, combined with the presence of many invasive species, have substantially altered the fish communities in this area. we quantified temporal changes in fish communities in 3 large river basins in relation to putative anthropogenic stressors, including increased sediment supply derived from row crop agriculture (beginning in 1880), habitat fragmentation caused by reservoir construction (beginning in the 1950s), and reduced discharge caused by groundwater withdrawal (beginning in the 1960s). we hypothesized that these abiotic regime shifts, coupled with species invasions, would shift the system from a fish community dominated by lotic (flowing water) species to one dominated by lentic (still water) species. further, we predicted that the timing and intensity of community change would vary across basins that experienced different types and levels of stressors. restructuring of fish communities across the 3 river basins was driven primarily by similar increases in lentic species, with only a few declines in several large river species. current fish communities in these basins share <50% of the species recorded in historic collections, and these differences were driven by species extirpations and invasions. the greatest levels of community divergence over time occurred in western kansas basins that experienced the most intense groundwater withdrawals and fragmentation by reservoirs. an alarming result from this analysis was the recent (after 1991) expansion of several invasive species in the arkansas and lower kansas river basins and the decline or extirpation of several native species where flow regimes are less heavily altered. accelerating changes in the biota and habitat identified by our retrospective analysis highlight potential complications for restoring the habitat and native fish communities to a previous state."

Gromak et al.,2006,Molecular and Cellular Biology,pause sites promote transcriptional termination of mammalian rna polymerase ii,"polymerase ii (pol ii) transcriptional termination depends on two independent genetic elements: poly(a) signals and downstream terminator sequences. the latter may either promote cotranscriptional rna cleavage or pause elongating pol ii. we demonstrate that the previously characterized maz(4) pause element promotes pol ii termination downstream of a poly(a) signal, dependent on both the proximity of the pause site and poly(a) signal and the strength of the poly(a) signal. the 5' > 3' exonuclease xrn2 facilitates this pause dependent termination by degrading the 3' product of poly(a) site cleavage. the human beta actin gene also possesses poly(a) site proximal pause sequences, which like maz(4) are g rich and promote transcriptional termination. xrn2 depletion causes an increase in both steady state rna and pol ii levels downstream of the beta actin poly(a) site. taken together, we provide new insights into the mechanism of pause site mediated termination and establish a general role for the 5' > 3' exonuclease xrn2 in pol ii termination."
Groves et al.,2008,Water Resources Research,developing and applying uncertain global climate change projections for regional water management planning,"climate change may impact water resources management conditions in difficult to predict ways. a key challenge for water managers is how to incorporate highly uncertain information about potential climate change from global models into local  and regional scale water management models and tools to support local planning. this paper presents a new method for developing large ensembles of local daily weather that reflect a wide range of plausible future climate change scenarios while preserving many statistical properties of local historical weather patterns. this method is demonstrated by evaluating the possible impact of climate change on the inland empire utilities agency service area in southern california. the analysis shows that climate change could impact the region, increasing outdoor water demand by up to 10% by 2040, decreasing local water supply by up to 40% by 2040, and decreasing sustainable groundwater yields by up to 15% by 2040. the range of plausible climate projections suggests the need for the region to augment its long range water management plans to reduce its vulnerability to climate change."
Hammani et al.,2009,Irrigation and Drainage,paving the way for groundwater management: transforming information for crafting management rules,"in many countries, farmers are turning to groundwater to make up for surfacewater scarcity and to deal with increasing water demand. even inside large scale irrigation schemes. in many situations, this leads to the mining of groundwater resources, which in turn threatens the sustainability of the farms that depend on this resource. the purpose of this study was to find ways to provide the necessary information to stakeholders to enable them to construct rules for sustainable groundwater management. the dynamics of water resources and water use practices were analysed and management indicators were designed for two irrigation schemes in north africa: tadla (morocco) and mitidja west (algeria). the results showed, firstly, that available groundwater has decreased; secondly, that farming systems depend to an increasing extent on groundwater resources, and thirdly, that individual and collective access to groundwater depends on informal arrangements. we developed and tested a platform for dialogue for water management focused on exploring plausible scenarios of agricultural development in relation to the use of groundwater. copyright (c) 2009 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Hanasaki et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,an estimation of global virtual water flow and sources of water withdrawal for major crops and livestock products using a global hydrological model,"the concept of virtual water, which is the volume of water consumption required to produce commodities traded to an importing or exporting nation (or any region, company, individual, etc.), is a useful complement to water resource analyses of water availability and use by region. identifying the source of virtual water, such as precipitation (green water) and irrigation water (blue water), further enhances this concept because each differs in the level of sustainability and opportunity cost. recent improvements in global hydrological models consisting of both physically based hydrological and anthropogenic activity modules enabled us to simulate the virtual water content of major crops consistent with their global hydrological simulation. enhancing one of these models, called h08. we were able to assess two major sources of virtual water flow or content simultaneously: green water and blue water. blue water was further subdivided into three subcategories (i.e., streamflow, medium size reservoirs, and nonrenewable and nonlocal blue water). we conducted a global hydrological simulation for 15 years from 1985 to 1999 at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees (longitude and latitude). total precipitation on land was 113,900 km(3) yr( 1), with 72,080 km(3) yr( 1) on average evaporating in the period 1985 1999. green water evapotranspiration from rainfed and irrigated cropland and blue water evapotranspiration from irrigated cropland was estimated at 7820, 1720, and 1530 km(3) yr( 1), respectively. next, using global trade data for 2000 and the simulated virtual water content of major crops, the virtual water flow was estimated globally. our results indicated that the global virtual water export (i.e., the volume of water that an exporting nation consumes to produce the commodities that it trades abroad) of five crops (barley, maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) and three livestock products (beef, pork, and chicken) is 545 km(3) yr( 1). of the total virtual water exports, 61 km(3) yr( 1) (11%) are blue water (i.e., irrigation water) and 26 km(3) yr( 1) (5%) are nonrenewable and nonlocal blue water.

Hatch et al.,2006,Water Resources Research,quantifying surfacewater groundwater interactions using time series analysis of streambed thermal records: method development,"we present a method for determining streambed seepage rates using time series thermal data. the new method is based on quantifying changes in phase and amplitude of temperature variations between pairs of subsurface sensors. for a reasonable range of streambed thermal properties and sensor spacings the time series method should allow reliable estimation of seepage rates for a range of at least +/  10 m d( 1) (+/  1.2 x 10( 2) m s( 1)), with amplitude variations being most sensitive at low flow rates and phase variations retaining sensitivity out to much higher rates. compared to forward modeling, the new method requires less observational data and less setup and data handling and is faster, particularly when interpreting many long data sets. the time series method is insensitive to streambed scour and sedimentation, which allows for application under a wide range of flow conditions and allows time series estimation of variable streambed hydraulic conductivity. this new approach should facilitate wider use of thermal methods and improve understanding of the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of surfacewater groundwater interactions."
Hatipoglu et al.,2009,Hydrogeology Journal,characterization of the groundwater flow system in the hillside and coastal aquifers of the mersin tarsus region (turkey),"in the region between mersin and tarsus cities, located along the mediterranean sea coast in southern turkey, the demand for groundwater has increased dramatically as the available surfacewater supplies have already been developed. fundamental information is required to characterize the existing groundwater system in this area in order to establish a sustainable groundwater use policy. for this purpose, hydrochemical and environmental isotopic data were collected and integrated with available geological and hydrogeological information to develop a conceptual model of the system. results, backed up mainly by depleted stable isotope composition and infinitesimal tritium content, suggest that most of the groundwater along the coastal zone is supplied by the neighboring mountain belt while local precipitation has also contributes to aquifer recharge. the validation of the conceptual perspective by a steady state numerical groundwater flow model reveals that about 90% of the recharge to the aquifer system is supplied by the deep flow of karstic groundwater fed from the taurus mountains. monitoring of changes in the recharge regime of the mountain sector seems to be critical in establishing future groundwater use policies."

Henriksen et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrology,assessment of exploitable groundwater resources of denmark by use of ensemble resource indicators and a numerical groundwater surfacewater model,"the trend towards construction of comprehensive dynamical numerical groundwater surfacewater models to facilitate the examination of the quantitative status of groundwater resources by means of indicators is growing. a typical resource indicator is the assumption that the maximum abstraction should not exceed the groundwater recharge to an aquifer. from an aquatic, ecological point of view, the recommendation is only to exploit a small fraction of the recharge, in order to allow a significant fraction to supply wetlands and river systems. the paper proposes a set of four resource indicators for translating qualitative policy considerations on sustainable groundwater developments into quantitative criteria that can be evaluated by use of comprehensive hydrological models: (1) indicator 1 is equal to a maximum abstraction of 35% of the pre abstraction recharge; (2) indicator 2 assumes a maximum 30% utilisation of current recharge; (3) indicator 3 is identified as the abstraction at which mean river runoff is reduced by a maximum 10%, compared to pre abstraction runoff; and (4) indicator 4 is the abstraction at which baseflow is reduced by a maximum 5%, 10%, 15%, 25% and 50% aggregated for the reaches with the same environmental goal (e.g. a maximum 10% reduction of baseflow for salmonid spawning and nursery waters compared to pre abstraction baseflow). the methodology for the design of the four ensemble resource indicators is described and the results of applying those indicators are demonstrated for assessment of the regional and national exploitable groundwater resources of denmark.

Holman et al.,2009,Hydrogeology Journal,"a comparison of stochastic and deterministic downscaling methods for modelling potential groundwater recharge under climate change in east anglia, uk: implications for groundwater resource management","groundwater resource estimates require the calculation of recharge using a daily time step. within climate change impact studies, this inevitably necessitates temporal downscaling of global or regional climate model outputs. this paper compares future estimates of potential groundwater recharge calculated using a daily soil waterbalance model and climate change weather time series derived using change factor (deterministic) and weather generator (stochastic) methods for coltishall, uk. the uncertainty in the results for a given climate change scenario arising from the choice of downscaling method is greater than the uncertainty due to the emissions scenario within a 30 year time slice. robust estimates of the impact of climate change on groundwater resources require stochastic modelling of potential recharge, but this has implications for groundwater model runtimes. it is recommended that stochastic modelling of potential recharge is used in vulnerable or sensitive groundwater systems, and that the multiple recharge time series are sampled according to the distribution of contextually important time series variables, e.g. recharge drought severity and persistence (for water resource management) or high recharge years (for groundwater flooding). such an approach will underpin an improved understanding of climate change impacts on sustainable groundwater resource management based on adaptivemanagement and risk based frameworks."
Hu et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,"agricultural water saving and sustainable groundwater management in shijiazhuang irrigation district, north china plain","north china plain (ncp) is one of the most important agricultural production regions in china. a severe water shortage, due to intensive irrigation, exists in the plain. in ncp, crop water use accounts for 70% of total groundwater use in the floodplains and over 87% in the piedmont regions. surfacewater in the plain is limited and restricted for urban water supply. agricultural production therefore heavily relies on groundwater irrigation; the main driver of groundwater depletion in the region. to address the water shortage issue, a flexible and sustainable water management method is proposed. the method integrates crop growth and groundwater model, and ensures groundwater recovery via agricultural water saving. the method is successfully tested for the 4763 km(2) shijiazhuang irrigation district in the piedmont region of mount taihang. the model results show that 29.2% or 135.7 mm reduction in irrigation could stop groundwater drawdown in the plain. an additional 10% reduction in irrigation pumping (i.e., a total of 39.2% or 182.1 mm) would induce groundwater recovery and restoration to the pre development hydrologic conditions of 1956 in about 74 years. the farmers' current irrigation practices are inefficient and wasteful of the limited water resources. under appropriate irrigation schemes therefore, grain yield loss as a result of the 39.2% agricultural water saving is less than 10%. this minimal agronomic loss is economically acceptable, giving the ecological and environmental benefits of groundwater recovery in the study area. however, successful agricultural water saving requires not only practical feasibility of models, but also sufficient political commitment, promotion of water saving incentives and efficient water saving technologies, and enforcement of sustainable water management policies.

Jiang et al.,2008,Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science,estimation of soil water content and evapotranspiration from irrigated cropland on the north china plain,"for nearly 30 y, cropland on the north china plain (ncp) has been irrigated primarily by pumping groundwater with no sustainable management strategy. this has caused a continuous decline of the watertable. a sustainable groundwater management and irrigation strategy must be established in order to prevent further decline of the watertable; to do this, one must quantify soil water content and daily rates of deep percolation and locate evapotranspiration from irrigated cropland. for that purpose, we developed a three layer soil waterbalance (swb) model based on an approach described by kendy et al. (2003). in this model, the unsaturated soil zone is divided into three layers: a surface active layer, a middle active soil layer, and a lowest passive soil layer. the middle and the lowest layers dynamically change with the development of crop rooting depth. a simple ""tipping bucket"" routine and an exponential equation are used to redistribute soil water in the three soil layers. the actual evapotranspiration estimated is partitioned into soil evaporation and crop transpiration using a dual crop coefficient reference approach. at first, the model was calibrated using data obtained from five deficiently irrigated field plots located at an experimental site in the ncp between 1998 and 2003. then, the model was validated by comparing estimated soil water contents with measured ones at three other plots with nondeficient irrigation. the estimates of actual evapotranspiration were compared with those measured with a large scale weighing lysimeter (3 m(2)). the index of agreement (ia) for soil water contents varied between 0.62 and 0.80; the concordance correlation coefficient (ccc) and the root mean square error obtained from the same comparison were 0.34 0.65 and 0.043 0.074 cm(3) cm( 3), respectively. the rates of 10 d mean evapotranspiration estimated by the model show a good fit to those measured by the large scale lysimeter; this is indicated by ia = 0.94 and ccc = 0.88. our results indicate that at the irrigated cropland on the plain, deep soil water percolation rates are usually < 200 mm y( 1) under nondeficient irrigation conditions."
Jimenez-Martinez et al.,2009,Journal of Hydrology,a root zone modelling approach to estimating groundwater recharge from irrigated areas,"in irrigated semi arid and and regions, accurate knowledge of groundwater recharge is important for the sustainable management of scarce water resources. the campo de cartagena area of southeast spain is a semi arid region where irrigation return flow accounts for a substantial portion of recharge. in this study we estimated irrigation return flow using a root zone modelling approach in which irrigation, evapo transpiration, and soil moisture dynamics for specific crops and irrigation regimes were simulated with the hydrus 1d software package. the model was calibrated using field data collected in an experimental plot. good agreement was achieved between the hydrus 1d simulations and field measurements made under melon and lettuce crops. the simulations indicated that water use by the crops was below potential levels despite regular irrigation. the fraction of applied water (irrigation plus precipitation) going to recharge ranged from 22% for a summer melon crop to 68% for a fall lettuce crop. in total, we estimate that irrigation of annual fruits and vegetables produces 26 hm(3) y( 1) of groundwater recharge to the top unconfined aquifer. this estimate does not include important irrigated perennial crops in the region, such as artichoke and citrus. overall, the results suggest a greater amount of irrigation return flow in the campo de cartagena region than was previously estimated.

Jirakova et al.,2009,Journal of Hydrology,palaeorecharge conditions of the deep aquifers of the northern aquitaine region (france),"the study was carried out in the northern part of the aquitaine basin extending in southwest france. the basin has been intensively exploited for various purposes for many years. although the geological context is well known, there are still some gaps in the knowledge about the hydrogeochemical regime, groundwater average residence time and the palaeohydrological conditions prevailing during the recharge period which would help to secure sustainable exploitation of the resources. environmental isotopes (180, (2)h, (3)h, (13)c) together with radiocarbon were used to evaluate hydrochemical evolution, residence time and palaeorecharge conditions for jurassic, cretaceous and eocene aquifers. radiocarbon activity in the aquifers varies widely between 0 and 94 pmc. after radiocarbon corrections the ages indicate both modern and old waters sometimes exceeding the limit for (14)c dating. the fontes and garnier model is best adapted to the specificity of the carbonate system. the content in stable isotopes of water is varying between  7.7% and  4.9% for delta(18)o and  52.3 parts per thousand to  29.6 parts per thousand for delta(2)h. the wide ranges of stable isotopic values imply variable climatic conditions. a group of isotopically depleted samples was detected, indicating colder climatic conditions during the recharge. radiocarbon ages calculation, together with isotopic signature, point out that the depletion in stable isotopic values fits the period between 20 and 15 ka b.p. and therefore indicate the last glacial maximum (lgm). according to the correction model, the transition from pleistocene to holocene would occur between 15 and 12 ka b.p. palaeohydrological data from the northern aquitaine basin does not confirm a significant hiatus in the recharge history. the recharge conditions in south europe seem to have occurred under discontinuous permafrost conditions as documented by many palaeoclimatological archives. this is in favour of an uninterrupted recharge of the confined aquifers of northern aquitaine basin. such information should be considered by modellers in their attempts to simulate the hydrogeological functioning of large confined aquifers on the very long time range.

Jorgensen et al.,2009,Hydrogeology Journal,"groundwater monitoring in denmark: characteristics, perspectives and comparison with other countries","more than 99% of water use in denmark is based on groundwater. denmark has had a comprehensive national groundwater monitoring programme since 1988 based on 74 well catchment areas and six small agricultural catchments with more than 1,500 screens at different depths for regular, mostly annual, water quality sampling. in addition, water samples from 10,000 abstraction wells are analysed every 3 5 years. the water is analysed for main components, inorganic trace elements, organic micro pollutants, and pesticides and their metabolites. a unique feature is the 20 year time series data of inorganic pollutants. groundwater modelling supports traditional monitoring to improve the conceptual geological understanding and to assess the quantitative status and the interaction between groundwater and surfacewater. the programme has been continuously adjusted to incorporate new knowledge from research programmes and meet new policy demands, currently the european union water framework directive, particularly with respect to an increased focus on quantitative aspects and on the groundwater/surfacewater interaction. the strengths and weaknesses of the danish programme are assessed and compared with other national groundwater monitoring programmes. issues discussed include: strategic considerations for monitoring design, the link between research and monitoring, and adoption of responses to climate changes."
Kalbus et al.,2006,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,measuring methods for groundwater   surfacewater interactions: a review,"interactions between groundwater and surfacewater play a fundamental role in the functioning of riparian ecosystems. in the context of sustainable river basin management it is crucial to understand and quantify exchange processes between groundwater and surfacewater. numerous well known methods exist for parameter estimation and process identification in aquifers and surfacewaters. only in recent years has the transition zone become a subject of major research interest; thus, the need has evolved for appropriate methods applicable in this zone. this article provides an overview of the methods that are currently applied and described in the literature for estimating fluxes at the groundwater   surfacewater interface. considerations for choosing appropriate methods are given including spatial and temporal scales, uncertainties, and limitations in application. it is concluded that a multi scale approach combining multiple measuring methods may considerably constrain estimates of fluxes between groundwater and surfacewater."
Kalf et al.,2005,Hydrogeology Journal,applicability and methodology of determining sustainable yield in groundwater systems,"there is currently a need for a review of the definition and methodology of determining sustainable yield. the reasons are: (1) current definitions and concepts are ambiguous and non physically based so cannot be used for quantitative application, (2) there is a need to eliminate varying interpretations and misinterpretations and provide a sound basis for application, (3) the notion that all groundwater systems either are or can be made to be sustainable is invalid, (4) often there are an excessive number of factors bound up in the definition that are not easily quantifiable, (5) there is often confusion between production facility optimal yield and basin sustainable yield, (6) in many semi arid and and environments groundwater systems cannot be sensibly developed using a sustained yield policy particularly where ecological constraints are applied. derivation of sustainable yield using conservation of mass principles leads to expressions for basin sustainable, partial (non sustainable) mining and total (non sustainable) mining yields that can be readily determined using numerical modelling methods and selected on the basis of applied constraints. for sonic cases there has to be recognition that the groundwater resource is not renewable and its use cannot therefore be sustainable. in these cases, its destiny should be the best equitable use."
Kamel et al.,2005,Energy,the economics of hybrid power systems for sustainable desert agriculture in egypt,"egypt has embarked on an ambitious desert land reclamation program in order to increase total food production. energy planners for these desert agriculture locations have chosen diesel generation power technology because minimization of the initial capital cost of a power supply system is their top priority. this heavy reliance on diesel generation has negative effects on the surrounding environment including soil, groundwater, and air pollution. although good solar and wind resource prospects exist for the use of cleaner hybrid power systems in certain desert locations, little research has been done to investigate the economic potential of such systems in egypt's desert agriculture sector. using optimization software, we assess the economics of hybrid power systems versus the present diesel generation technology in a remote agricultural development area. we also consider the emission reduction advantages of using hybrid systems. interestingly enough, optimization results show that hybrid systems are less costly than diesel generation from a net present cost perspective even with the high diesel fuel price subsidies. since hybrids are also more environmentally friendly, they represent a strong step towards achieving sustainable desert agriculture.

Kim et al.,2003,Geophysical Research Letters,large submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) from a volcanic island,"we measured seepage rates of coastal groundwater from a volcanic island, standing in the south sea of korea. the seepage rates measured along the sandy coast were in the range 50 300 m/yr, which are much higher than those reported from typical continental coast. the o 18 tracer in potential seeping waters signifies that they are mixtures of basal groundwater and pristine seawaters. on the eastern coast of jeju, almost all groundwater discharge is attributed to recirculating seawater, while fresh groundwater contributes about 20% of the total submarine groundwater discharge (sgd) on the western coast of jeju. thus, sgd appears to be important for the management of water resources in western jeju. the measured radionuclides (ra 228, ra 226, and rn 222) and nutrients in the groundwater suggest that the discharge of both fresh and recirculated seawater will have a significant influence on the budget of coastal nutrients and other chemical constituents in this region."
Kim et al.,2006,Journal of Hydrology,"tidal effects on variations of fresh saltwater interface and groundwater flow in a multilayered coastal aquifer on a volcanic island (jeju island, korea)","we conducted various field studies at the seawater intrusion monitoring wells located in the eastern part of jeju island, korea, to observe the tidal effect on groundwater seawater flow in the coastal aquifer. studies included monitoring the fluctuations of groundwater and tide levels, electrical and temperature logging, and 2 d heat pulse flowmeter tests. according to time series analysis, tidal effects on groundwater level reached up to 3 km inland from the coastline. water level variation was more sensitive to tidal fluctuations near the coast, and more related to rainfall toward inland areas. temporal and spatial variations in the shape and location of the freshwater saltwater interface were analyzed using data from nine monitoring wells. the results indicated that the interface toe is located at a distance of 6 8 km from the coastline and its location was related to geological layers present. long term seasonal variations revealed no major changes in the interface; minor variations were due to moving boundarycondition induced by tidal fluctuations. using the two dimensional heat pulse flowmeter, groundwater flowdirection and velocities at four tidal stages were measured on three monitoring wells drilled into the multilayered aquifers. this direct measurement enabled us to relate the differences of flow velocities and directions with geology and tidal fluctuations. combining the results of ec logging and flowmeter tests, we found a zone where freshwater and saltwater moved alternately in opposite directions, as influenced by the tidal fluctuations. integrating various physical togging and flowmeter data with water level fluctuations improved our understanding of the behavior of fresh and seawater flow in the coastal aquifers.

Kim et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrology,development and application of the integrated swat modflow model,"this paper suggests a new approach for integrating the quasi distributed watershed model, swat, with the fully distributed groundwater model, modflow. since the swat model has semi distributed features, its groundwater component does not consider distributed parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient. in generating a detailed representation of groundwater recharge, it is equally difficult to calculate the head distribution and the distributed pumping rate. in order to solve this problem a method is proposed whereby the characteristics of the hydrologic response units (hrus) in the swat model. are exchanged with cells in the modflow model. by using this hru cell conversion interface, the distributed groundwater recharge rate and the groundwater evapotranspiration can be effectively simulated. by considering the interaction between the stream network and the aquifer to reflect boundary flow, the linkage is completed. for this purpose, the river package in the modflow mode(is used for river aquifer interaction. this combined modeling is applied to the musimcheon basin in korea. the application demonstrates that an integrated swat modflow is capable of simulating a spatio temporal distribution of groundwater recharge rates, aquifer evapotranspiration and groundwater levels. it also enables an interaction between the saturated aquifer and channel reaches. this interaction played an important role in the generation of groundwater discharge in the basin, especially during the tow flow period. the advanced water transfer method in swat modflow was successfully tested, and reproduced the distributed drawdown and reduced stream flow by pumping with multiple wells. therefore, when considering discharge to streams, springs or marshes, the use of this model would be beneficial in planning for the sustainable development of groundwater.

Kim et al.,2003,Journal of Hydrology,"hydrogeochemical and isotopic evidence of groundwater salinization in a coastal aquifer: a case study in jeju volcanic island, korea","in order to identify the origin of saline groundwater in the eastern part of jeju volcanic island, korea, a hydrogeochemical and isotopic study has been carried out for 18 observation wells located in east and southeast coastal regions. the total dissolved solid contents of groundwaters are highly variable (77 21,782 mg/l). oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and strontium isotopic data clearly show that the saline water results from mixing of groundwater with seawater. strontium isotopic compositions and br/cl and i/cl ratios strongly suggest that the source of salinity is modem seawater intrusion. hydrogeochemical characteristics based on bivariate diagrams of major and minor ions show that changes in the chemical composition of groundwater are mainly controlled by the salinization process followed by cation exchange reactions. the highly permeable aquifers at the east coastal region are characterized by low hydraulic gradient and discharge rate and high hydraulic conductivity as compared with other regions. these properties enhance the salinization of groundwater observed in the study area. based on the cl, br, and delta(18)o data, seawater was determined to have intruded inland some 2.5 km from the coastline. considering the poor correlation of sampling depth and cl concentrations observed, the position of seawater freshwater interface is not uniformly distributed in the study area, due to heterogeneities of the basaltic aquifers.

Kourakos et al.,2009,Advances in Water Resources,pumping optimization of coastal aquifers based on evolutionary algorithms and surrogate modular neural network models,"pumping optimization of coastal aquifers involves complex numerical models. in problems with many decision variables, the computational burden for reaching the optimal solution can be excessive. artificial neural networks (ann) are flexible function approximators and have been used as surrogate models of complex numerical models in groundwater optimization. however, this approach is not practical in cases where the number of decision variables is large, because the required neural network structure can be very complex and difficult to train. the present study develops an optimization method based on modular neural networks, in which several small subnetwork modules, trained using a fast adaptive procedure, cooperate to solve a complex pumping optimization problem with many decision variables. the method utilizes the fact that salinity distribution in the aquifer, depends more on pumping from nearby wells rather than from distant ones. each subnetwork predicts salinity in only one monitoring well, and is controlled by relatively few pumping wells falling within certain control distance from the monitoring well. while the initial control area is radial, its shape is aclaptively improved using a hermite interpolation procedure. the modular neural subnetworks are trained adaptively during optimization, and it is possible to retrain only the ones not performing well. as optimization progresses, the subnetworks are adapted to maximize performance near the current search space of the optimization algorithm. the modular neural subnetwork models are combined with an efficient optimization algorithm and are applied to a real coastal aquifer in the greek island of santorini. the numerical code seawat was selected for solving the partial differential equations of flow and density dependent transport. the decision variables correspond to pumping rates from 34 wells. the modular subnetwork implementation resulted in significant reduction in cpu time and identified an even better solution than the original numerical model.

Kulkarni et al.,2004,Hydrogeology Journal,groundwater demand management at local scale in rural areas of india: a strategy to ensure water well sustainability based on aquifer diffusivity and community participation,"watershed development programmes provide an opportunity for sustainable management strategies, although currently, they remain largely 'supply side' mechanisms of water resources development. hydrogeological conditions, community participation and status of groundwater usage are important in evolving strategies on 'demand side' groundwater management. neemkheda aquifer is a typical low storage, low hydraulic conductivity aquifer from a watershed in the dryland regions of madhya pradesh state of central india. a shallow unconfined aquifer, it consists of an upper coarse, calcareous sandstone unit underlain by a fine grained sandstone unit. a 'well commune' of seven wells is poised to test the concept of joint groundwater management, wherein wells are mechanisms of tapping a common water source, the neemkheda aquifer. the strategy for systematic groundwater management in the neemkheda well commune is based upon the relationship between transmissivity (t) and storage coefficient (s), i.e. aquifer diffusivity, and its variation within the aquifer. wells within a high diffusivity domain tend to dewater more quickly than wells within a low diffusivity domain. a well use schedule during the dry season, based upon aquifer diffusivity forms the basis of the groundwater management concept. the distribution of local aquifer diffusivities governs the relationship between local and regional aquifer depletion times and forms the basis of the groundwater management exercise being proposed for the neemkheda aquifer."
Kunstmann et al.,2006,Journal of Hydrology,direct propagation of probability density functions in hydrological equations,"sustainable decisions in hydrological risk management require detailed information on the probability density function (pdf) of the model output. only then probabilities for the failure of a specific management option or the exceedance of critical thresholds (e.g. of pollutants) can be derived. a new approach of uncertainty propagation in hydrological equations is developed that directly propagates the probability density functions of uncertain model input parameters into the corresponding probability density functions of model output. the basics of the methodology are presented and central applications to different disciplines in hydrology are shown. this work focuses on the following basic hydrological equations: (1) pumping test analysis (theis equation, propagation of uncertainties in recharge and transmissivity), (2) 1 dim groundwater contaminant transport equation (gauss equation, propagation of uncertainties in decay constant and dispersivity), (3) evapotranspiration estimation (penman monteith equation, propagation of uncertainty in roughness length). the direct propagation of probability densities is restricted to functions that are monotonically increasing or decreasing or that can be separated in corresponding monotonic branches so that inverse functions can be derived. in case no analytic solutions for inverse functions could be derived, semi analytical approximations were used. it is shown that the results of direct probability density function propagation are in perfect agreement with results obtained from corresponding monte carlo derived frequency distributions. direct pdf propagation, however, has the advantage that is yields exact solutions for the resulting hydrological pdfs rather than approximating discontinuous frequency distributions. it is additionally shown that the type of the resulting pdf depends on the specific values (order of magnitude, respectively) of the standard deviation of the input pdf. the dependency of skewness and kurtosis of the propagated pdf on the coefficient of variation of input parameter uncertainty is detected to be non monotonic with distinctive maxima.

Kustu et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,large scale water cycle perturbation due to irrigation pumping in the us high plains: a synthesis of observed streamflow changes,"we explore the influence of long term, large scale irrigational pumping on spatial and seasonal patterns of streamflow regimes in the high plains aquifer using extensive observational data to elucidate the effects of regional scale human alterations on the hydrological cycle. streamflow, groundwater and precipitation time series spanning all or part of the period of intensive irrigation development (1940 1980) in the region were analyzed for trend and step changes using the non parametric mann kendall test and the parametric student's t test, respectively. based on several indicators to evaluate the streamflow groundwater connection degree over the high plains aquifer, we found a systematic decrease in the hydraulic connection between groundwater and streamflow from the northern high plains to southern high plains. trends and step changes are consistent with this regional pattern. decreasing trends in annual and dry season (mean july august) streamflow and increasing trends in the number of low flow days are prevalent in the northern high plains with a gradual decrease in trend detection towards the south. additionally, field significance of trends was assessed by the regional kendall's s test over the period of most intensive irrigation development (1940 1980). the step change results imply that the observed decreases in streamflow are likely attributable to the significant declines in groundwater levels and unlikely related to changes in precipitation because the majority of precipitation data over the region did not reveal any significant changes. thus, it is very likely that extensive irrigational pumping have caused streamflow depletion, more severely, in the northern high plains, and to a lesser extent in the southern high plains over the period of study.

Ladouche et al.,2005,Journal of Hydrology,hydrochemical assessment of the rochefort marsh: role of surface and groundwater in the hydrological functioning of the wetland,"the interaction between a wetland (the rochefort agricultural marsh) and its underlying aquifers was studied using both geochemical and isotopic approaches. water from the various components of the hydrosystem (water from ditches, shallow 'bri' groundwater (silty clay deposits), deep 'bri' groundwater and groundwater in the kimmeridgian aquifer (confined and unconfined) was sampled and analysed for major and trace elements (sr, br), stable water isotopes (o 18 and h 2) and sr isotopes. the salinity of groundwater in the marsh (cl up to 15.5 g/l) can be attributed to seawater trapped in the clay sediments during the flandrian (12,000 6400 bp). the groundwater has since undergone more or less major chemical evolution due to water rock interactions and mixing with fresh water (rainwater, ditch water and kimmeridgian groundwater from the edge of the marsh). the chemical characteristics of the groundwater in the confined kimmeridgian underlying the bri formation exclude the possibility of a salt wedge. the combined use of delta o 18, delta h 2, cl, br and sr contents and sr 87/sr 86 ratios enabled exchanges between surfacewater in marsh canals and ditches and groundwater in the shallow bri aquifer ( < 2 m), and between groundwater in the deep bri (> 7 m) and in the confined kimmeridgian (> 18 m) aquifers, to be defined and quantified. during the summer, the ditches recharge the shallow bri aquifer by sub irrigation (gravity flow) by up to 26%. the presence of a very compact layer of clay, 1 2 m deep, prevents the rapid recharge of the deep bri aquifer by rainfall and direct hydraulic connections between the ditches and the deep bri aquifer. on the scale of the marsh, the confined kimmeridgian groundwater recharges the bri aquifer by upward flow (maximum contribution estimated to be 76 +/  13%), this flow being relatively limited and preferentially on the edge of the marsh. the deep bri groundwater contributes very locally to recharging the confined kimmeridgian aquifer (maximum contribution estimated to be 61 +/  36%). this study demonstrates the interest in combining hydrological and geochemical tools in order to identify and quantify the hydraulic interconnections between a wetland and its groundwater components. a prior understanding of how wetlands function is crucial for the sustainable management of such ecosystems.

Lavigne et al.,2010,Canadian Water Resources Journal,numerical simulation of groundwater flow in the chateauguay river aquifers,"the chateauguay river watershed extends over northeastern new york state (usa) and southwestern quebec (canada). fractured sedimentary rocks of the st. lawrence platform host the regional aquifers. quaternary sediments of variable thickness of up to 45 m overlie the bedrock. the geometric mean hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock aquifers obtained from 548 field measurements is 5.1 x 10( 5) m/s with a standard deviation of 0.7 of the logarithms. the modelled area extends from the foothills of the adirondacks to the st. lawrence river and covers 2,850 km(2). the numerical groundwater flow model was developed using the finite element simulator feflow. the model has 13 layers with layer thicknesses ranging from 5 m for the top layer to 75 m for the bottom layer. the average thickness of the numerical model is 655 m, for a total volume of 1,868 km(3). the st. lawrence river is considered as a specified head boundary; the base and other lateral limits are considered as no flow boundaries, whereas a head and conductivity dependent boundary is specified along major streams and wetlands. spatial recharge rate is applied as a specified flux across the top of the model and was fixed during calibration to reduce model uncertainty. groundwater withdrawal of 34 mm(3)/yr is assigned using sinks for major wells and as a uniform negative flux across the top of the model to account for domestic and other diffuse uses. calibration was carried out against 153 hydraulic head measurements, with horizontal hydraulic conductivity and vertical anisotropy used as calibration parameters. the regional groundwater flow amounts to 268 mm(3)/yr: 12.7% is withdrawn for domestic purposes; aquifer contribution to streams and wetlands is 176 mm(3)/yr, and 55 mm(3)/yr is discharged to the st. lawrence river. groundwater flow appears to be controlled by the sub horizontal bedding planes contributing to relatively high vertical anisotropy."
Lavigne et al.,2010,Canadian Water Resources Journal,regional sustainability of the chateauguay river aquifers,"a steady increase in groundwater use in the chateauguay river watershed has led to potential conflicts between various groundwater users. this study summarizes the quantity and sustainability estimations of the groundwater resources within this basin. regional sustainability is defined with simulated drawdowns from uniform withdrawal scenarios compared to water levels obtained without any withdrawal. three sustainable conditions are defined: sustainable withdrawal, withdrawal with increased drawdown, and unsustainable withdrawal. the current withdrawal rate of 34 mm(3)/yr results in a median drawdown of 1.5 m, compared to pre development conditions. this drawdown is well within the range considered sustainable, an indication that regional aquifers are not currently overexploited. a hypothetical pumping rate of 48 mm(3)/yr, resulting in an average drawdown of 2.2 m, is the estimated sustainable limit. increasing exploitation from 48 to 122 mm(3)/yr would need tight control and planning. withdrawal rates beyond 122 mm(3)/yr are judged not sustainable as the regional median drawdown would exceed 8 m. the water levels in recharge areas are the most sensitive to groundwater extraction. the combination of aquifer sensitivity to recharge variations, simulated drawdown maps, and aquifer vulnerability to surface contamination reveals the most sensitive areas of the regional aquifers, areas that would need particular attention and protection by groundwater managers."
Lee et al.,2007,Geophysical Research Letters,estimating submarine discharge of fresh groundwater from a volcanic island using a freshwaterbudget of the coastal water column,"the magnitude of submarine fresh groundwater discharge (sfgd) was estimated using a freshwaterbudget of the coastal water, which was calculated from salinity anomalies off a volcanic island, jeju, korea. we obtained high resolution profiles of salinity from the entire coastal area of jeju island using accurate ctd sensors. lower salinity anomalies relative to the pristine offshore seawaters were observed and assumed to be a result of sfgd on the basis of negligible surface runoffs from the island and the relatively high levels of rn 222 in the low salinity waters. the sfgd flux during the study period calculated from a freshwaterbudget of the water column was 2.5   3.8 x 10(6) m(3) d( 1), which is close to the long term average based on the inland waterbalance. our study shows that sfgd can be accurately and easily measured using a freshwaterbudget of the coastal waters off a highly permeable coastal zone with little surface runoff."
Lee et al.,2005,Geosciences Journal,dependency of hydrologic responses and recharge estimates on water level monitoring locations within a small catchment,"estimation of groundwater recharge is essential for planning sustainable groundwater development. in this study, recharge ratios were estimated using the groundwater hydrographs obtained from monitoring wells located in a small catchment (0.256 km(2)). the catchment area is a triangular alluvial plain bounded by gentle hills and a large stream. for the recharge estimation, the modified watertable fluctuation (wtf) method was used. although the study area is very small, the groundwater hydrographs were very different depending on the thickness of the unsaturated zone and the distance of the monitoring well from the main stream. where the unsaturated zone is thick, the groundwater level changes smoothly in response to rainfall and resulting amplitude is small. in addition, the hydrographs closer to the stream showed quicker responses and larger fluctuations. resultant recharge estimates showed a very wide variation between 2.5 and 20.1%. compared with 12.7% estimated by other study mainly based on the waterbudget analyses, the recharge ratios were underestimated in upgradient area (hills) while they were overestimated in downgradient area (stream). therefore, for representative and appropriate recharge estimation based on the groundwater hydrographs, it appears that the monitoring location is most important."
Lee et al.,2007,Journal of Hydrology,"analysis of water movement through an unsaturated soil zone in jeju island, korea using stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes","in order to analyze water movement through an unsaturated soil zone in jeju island, korea, temporal variations in the oxygen 18 and deuterium isotopes of precipitation and soil waters at three different depths were monitored for about one year. the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of the soil waters are plotted between or near the two local meteoric water lines for summer and winter precipitation indicating that the soil waters were recharged from the year around precipitation, and evaporation was negligible even during hot summer season in the study area. mean residence times of the soil waters were then estimated from the delta o 18, delta d, and deuterium excess or d values of the precipitation and soil waters using two well mixed or exponential models (em) and one exponential piston flow model (epm). the regression results show that the combination of the exponential piston flow model and the d values of the precipitation and soil waters gives the most reasonable estimation of the mean residence times of the soil waters in the study area. it suggests that the deuterium excess or d values can be used as a better parameter than the delta o 18 or delta d values alone for estimating mean residence times of subsurfacewaters not only in korea but also in other northeast asian countries. the estimated low moisture contents and hydraulic diffusivities of the soils at the three different depths also indicate that the boundary between the upper fine grained soil and the lower coarse grained soil may act as a capillary barrier, and the soil waters probably flow slowly through micropores rather than rapidly through macropores in the unsaturated soil zone.

Lemming et al.,2010,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,life cycle assessment of soil and groundwater remediation technologies: literature review,"life cycle assessment (lca) is becoming an increasingly widespread tool in support systems for environmental decision making regarding the cleanup of contaminated sites. in this study, the use of lca to compare the environmental impacts of different remediation technologies was reviewed. remediation of a contaminated site reduces a local environmental problem, but at the same time, the remediation activities may cause negative environmental impacts on the local, regional, and global scale. lca can be used to evaluate the inherent trade off and to compare remediation scenarios in terms of their associated environmental burden. an overview of the assessed remediation technologies and contaminant types covered in the literature is presented. the lca methodologies of the 12 reviewed studies were compared and discussed with special focus on their goal and scope definition and the applied impact assessment. the studies differ in their basic approach since some are prospective with focus on decision support while others are retrospective aiming at a more detailed assessment of a completed remediation project. the literature review showed that only few life cycle assessments have been conducted for in situ remediation technologies aimed at groundwater threatening contaminants and that the majority of the existing literature focuses on ex situ remediation of contaminated soil. the functional unit applied in the studies is generally based on the volume of contaminated soil (or groundwater) to be treated; this is in four of the studies combined with a cleanup target for the remediation. while earlier studies often used more simplified impact assessment models, the more recent studies based their impact assessment on established methodologies covering the conventional set of impact categories. ecotoxicity and human toxicity are the impact categories varying the most between these methodologies. many of the reviewed studies address the importance of evaluating both primary and secondary impacts of site remediation. primary impacts cover the local impacts related to residual contamination left in the subsurface during and after remediation and will vary between different remediation technologies due to different cleanup efficiencies and cleanup times. secondary impacts are resource use and emissions arising in other stages of the life cycle of the remediation project. among the reviewed literature, different approaches for modeling the long term primary impacts of site contamination have been used. these include steady state models as well as dynamic models. primary impacts are not solely a soil contamination or surfacewater issue, since many frequently occurring contaminants, such as chlorinated solvents, have the potential to migrate to the groundwater as well as evaporate to ambient air causing indoor climate problems. impacts in the groundwater compartment are not included in established impact assessment methodologies; thus, the potential groundwater contamination impacts from residual contamination are difficult to address in lca of site remediation. due to the strong dependence on local conditions (sensitivity of groundwater aquifer, use for drinking water supply, etc.) a more site specific impact assessment approach than what is normally applied in lca is of relevance. the inclusion of groundwater impacts from soil contaminants requires the definition of an impact category covering human toxicity via groundwater or the inclusion of these impacts in the human toxicity impact category and the associated characterization models and normalization procedures. when evaluating groundwater impacts, attention should also be paid to potentially degradable contaminants forming metabolites of higher human toxic concern than the parent compound."

Liou et al.,2010,Environmental Earth Sciences,"alternative water resources in granitic rock: a case study from kinmen island, taiwan","kinmen island is a small, tectonically stable, granitic island that has been suffering from a scarcity of fresh water resources due to excessive annual evapotranspiration over annual precipitation. recent studies further indicate that shallow (0 70 m) sedimentary aquifers, the major sources of groundwater supply, have already been over exploited. therefore, this preliminary study is to investigate the existence of exploitable water resources that can balance the shortage of fresh water on this island. site characterization data are obtained from island wide geophysical surveys as well as small scale tests performed in a study area formed by three deep (maximum depth to 560 m) vertical boreholes installed in mid east kinmen northeast to taiwu mountain. vertical fracture frequency data indicate that the rock body is fractured with a spatially correlated pattern, from which three major fracture zones (depths 0 70, 330 360, and below 450 m) can be identified. geologic investigations indicate that the deepest fracture zone is caused by the large scale, steeply dipping taiwushan fault. this fault may have caused a laterally extensive low resistivity zone, a potential fractured aquifer, near taiwu mountain. the middle fracture zone is induced by the taiwushan fault and intersects the fault approximately 21 m southeast of the study area below a depth of 350 m. slug testing results yield fracture transmissivity varying from 4.8 x 10( 7) to 2.2 x 10( 4) m(2)/s. cross hole tests have confirmed that hydraulic connectivity of the deeper rock body is controlled by the taiwushan fault and the middle fracture zone. this connectivity may extend vertically to the sedimentary aquifers through high angle joint sets. despite the presence of a flow barrier formed by doleritic dike at about 300 m depth, the existence of fresh as well as meteoric water in the deeper rock body manifests that certain flow paths must exist through which the deeper fractured aquifers can be connected to the upper rock body. therefore, groundwater stored within the taiwushan fault and the associated low resistivity zone can be considered as additional fresh water resources for future exploitation."

Loaiciga et al.,2004,Journal of Hydrology,analytic game   theoretic approach to groundwater extraction,"the roles of cooperation and non cooperation in the sustainable exploitation of a jointly used groundwater resource have been quantified mathematically using an analytical game theoretic formulation. cooperative equilibrium arises when groundwater users respect water level constraints and consider mutual impacts, which allows them to derive economic benefits from groundwater indefinitely, that is, to achieve sustainability. this work shows that cooperative equilibrium can be obtained from the solution of a quadratic programming problem. for cooperative equilibrium to hold, however, enforcement must be effective. otherwise, according to the commonized costs privatized profits paradox, there is a natural tendency towards non cooperation and non sustainable aquifer mining, of which overdraft is a typical symptom. non cooperative behavior arises when at least one groundwater user neglects the externalities of his adopted groundwater pumping strategy. in this instance, water level constraints may be violated in a relatively short time and the economic benefits from groundwater extraction fall below those obtained with cooperative aquifer use. one example illustrates the game theoretic approach of this work.

MacKay et al.,2006,Australian Journal of Botany,protection and management of groundwater dependent ecosystems: emerging challenges and potential approaches for policy and management,"the protection of ecosystems associated with groundwater, and thus potentially vulnerable to groundwater exploitation, is only now being recognised as an important aspect of water management. although there has been a gradual increase in scientific understanding of the links between groundwater availability and ecosystem health, a significant challenge remains in the development and implementation of policy that adequately addresses the protection of groundwater dependent ecosystems. there is no single right way to solve the problem of protecting groundwater dependent ecosystems, while still allowing the use of groundwater to support social and economic development, poverty alleviation and improved food and water security. this paper provides a global perspective in examining the potential impacts of the lack of policy, or poor implementation of policy, related to groundwater dependent ecosystems, and discusses emerging approaches in this field. the following two important factors are considered in the paper: first, the difficulty of managing typically local  and regional scale problems associated with groundwater exploitation, by using national scale policy interventions and regulation; second, the need to shorten the cycle from science to policy and regulation, and thence to management activities on the ground, in order to encourage policy shifts in the short to medium term that better reflect the available scientific knowledge of groundwater dependent ecosystems."
Maclear et al.,2001,Water Sa,the hydrogeology of the uitenhage artesian basin with reference to the table mountain group aquifer,"the uitenhage artesian basin (uab) lies in the eastern cape and is south africa's most important artesian groundwater basin supplying approximately 1 400 ml/yr (44 l/s) of water from springs for domestic use to uitenhage, as well a supporting large citrus irrigation schemes. groundwater from this basin has been extensively utilised from the early part of the 20(th) century, including periods of overexploitation resulting in the declaration of a groundwater control area to limit abstraction to sustainable rates. the aquifer comprises fractured table mountain group (tmg) sandstones confined in the eastern part of the basin by overlying cretaceous siltstones and mudstones resulting in artesian conditions. the coega fault is a major structural feature dividing the basin into separate system, viz. the southern swartkops aquifer and the northern coega ridge aquifer, that are hydrogeologically independent of each other. the elands river syncline divides the swartkops aquifer further into the kruisrivier and bethelsdorp units. borehole yields commonly range from 5 to 10 l/s and the groundwater quality is excellent with low salinities. water hardening, however, is required due to the acidic and corrosive nature of the groundwater, typical of other table mountain group aquifers in south africa. using c 14 data, the age of the groundwater in the basin ranges from 1 500 to 28 000 years with a calculated flow rate of 0.8 m/a. from the chloride mass balance method, recharge rates are determined to be 25 to 55% of annual rainfall. groundwater temperatures generally show that depths of groundwater strikes do not necessarily correspond with depth of origin, indicating a complex groundwater circulation pattern within the basin. whilst the uab has been well studied locally, a basin scale hydrogeological characterisation is considered to be necessary, followed by recommendations and formulation of a management plan to ensure the continued sustainability of groundwater supply from this national asset."

Mathon et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrology,transmissivity and storage coefficient estimation by coupling the cooper jacob method and modified fuzzy least squares regression,"traditionally the cooper jacob equation is used to determine the transmissivity and the storage coefficient for an aquifer using pump test results. this model, however, is a simplified version of the actual subsurface and does not allow for analysis of the uncertainty that comes from a lack of knowledge about the heterogeneity of the environment under investigation. in this paper, a modified fuzzy least squares regression (mflsr) method is developed that uses imprecise pump test data to obtain fuzzy intercept and slope values which are then used in the cooper jacob method. fuzzy membership functions for the transmissivity and the storage coefficient are then calculated using the extension principle. the supports of the fuzzy membership functions incorporate the transmissivity and storage coefficient values that would be obtained using ordinary least squares regression and the cooper jacob method. the mflsr coupled with the cooper jacob method allows the analyst to ascertain the uncertainty that is inherent in the estimated parameters obtained using the simplified cooper jacob method and data that are uncertain due to lack of knowledge regarding the heterogeneity of the aquifer.

Michael et al.,2009,Hydrogeology Journal,controls on groundwater flow in the bengal basin of india and bangladesh: regional modeling analysis,"groundwater for domestic and irrigation purposes is produced primarily from shallow parts of the bengal basin aquifer system (india and bangladesh), which contains high concentrations of dissolved arsenic (exceeding worldwide drinking water standards), though deeper groundwater is generally low in arsenic. an essential first step for determining sustainable management of the deep groundwater resource is identification of hydrogeologic controls on flow and quantification of basin scale groundwater flow patterns. results from groundwater modeling, in which the bengal basin aquifer system is represented as a single aquifer with higher horizontal than vertical hydraulic conductivity, indicate that this anisotropy is the primary hydrogeologic control on the natural flowpath lengths. despite extremely low hydraulic gradients due to minimal topographic relief, anisotropy implies large scale (tens to hundreds of kilometers) flow at depth. other hydrogeologic factors, including lateral and vertical changes in hydraulic conductivity, have minor effects on overall flow patterns. however, because natural hydraulic gradients are low, the impact of pumping on groundwater flow is overwhelming; modeling indicates that pumping has substantially changed the shallow groundwaterbudget and flowpaths from predevelopment conditions."

Narasimhan et al.,2009,Environmental Research Letters,groundwater: from mystery to management,"groundwater has been used for domestic and irrigation needs from time immemorial. yet its nature and occurrence have always possessed a certain mystery because water below the land surface is invisible and relatively inaccessible. the influence of this mystery lingers in some tenets that govern groundwater law. with the birth of modern geology during the late nineteenth century, groundwater science became recognized in its own right. over the past two centuries, groundwater has lost its shroud of mystery, and its scientific understanding has gradually grown hand in hand with its development for human use. groundwater is a component of the hydrological cycle, vital for human sustenance. its annual renewability from precipitation is limited, and its chemical quality is vulnerable to degradation by human action. in many parts of the world, groundwater extraction is known to greatly exceed its renewability. consequently, its rational management to benefit present and future generations is a matter of deep concern for many nations. groundwater management is a challenging venture, requiring an integration of scientific knowledge with communal will to adapt to constraints of a finite common resource. as scientists and policy makers grapple with the tasks of groundwater management, it is instructive to reflect on the evolution of groundwater knowledge from its initial phase of demystification at the beginning of the nineteenth century, through successive phases of technological conquest, scientific integration, discovery of unintended consequences and the present recognition of an imperative for judicious management. the following retrospective provides a broad context for unifying the technical contributions that make up this focus issue on groundwater resources, climate and vulnerability."

Okten et al.,2005,Turkish Journal of Earth Sciences,"investigation of safe and sustainable yields for the sandy complex aquifer system in the ergene river basin, thrace region, turkey","this study aims to determine the safe and sustainable yields for the sandy complex aquifer system in ergene river basin in northwestern turkey. a numerical groundwater flow model was developed for the sandy complex aquifer, which is the most productive and the most widespread aquifer in the basin. the finite difference groundwater model was used to simulate steady and unsteady flow in the aquifer. the model was calibrated in two steps: a steady state calibration, by using the observed groundwater levels of january 1970; then a transient calibration, by using the observed groundwater levels for the period of january 1970 and december 2000. the resulting model was used to develop groundwater pumping scenarios in order to predict the changes in the aquifer system under a set of different pumpage conditions for a planning period of 30 years between january 2001 and december 2030. a total of eight pumping scenarios were developed under transient flow conditions for the planning period, and the results were evaluated to determine the safe and sustainable yields of the aquifer. the results, presented in the form of a trade off curve, demonstrate that both the safe and the sustainable yield values are exceeded if pumping continues at the present rate. an appropriate suite of management policies and plans are provided that will promote the sustainable development of the aquifer system."
Olsen et al.,2009,Hydrology Research,impact of groundwater abstraction on physical habitat of brown trout (salmo trutta) in a small danish stream,the purpose of this study was to assess the impact of groundwater abstraction on stream discharge and physical habitat conditions for brown trout (salmo trutta) in a small danish stream. stream discharge was simulated using a lumped hydrological model (nam) and a scenario was set up for stream discharge reference conditions. stream physical habitat conditions (wua) were simulated for four life stages of trout using a hydraulic habitat model (rhyhabsim). the impact of groundwater abstraction on wua for trout was assessed by combined simulations from the nam model and the rhyhabsim model. the model predicted that groundwater abstraction reduced median annual discharge by 37% and mean annual 90th percentile discharge by 82%. summer discharge was relatively most affected by groundwater abstraction and wua was therefore particularly affected by groundwater abstraction during summer. wua for adult trout was mainly controlled by suitable water depths (> 40 cm) even under conditions without abstraction. on an annual basis wua for fry and juvenile trout was most affected by abstraction. future modelling should consider improving simulation of low discharges and preferably not use general hydrological models.
Panda et al.,2007,Journal of Hydrology,"the influence of drought and anthropogenic effects on groundwater levels in orissa, india","investigating the response of groundwater levels to the extreme weather events provides essential information for sustainable planning and management of water resources. the aim of this study was to identify and quantify the groundwater level trend of the state orissa (india) to understand the forcing mechanism of droughts in conjunction with the anthropogenic pressure using the non parametric mann kendall statistical procedure. the pre  and post monsoon groundwater level. records of 1002 monitoring stations during the period 1994 2003 were analyzed. the results show that the drawdowns due to deficient rainfall during dry years, high temperatures, and anthropogenic pressure have not been recovered through the recharge in wet years. however, this study does not determine whether drought, high temperatures or anthropogenic effects have had largest influence on the groundwater levels decline. the cases of significant watertable declines are higher in number than those expected to occur by chance. in the pre monsoon season, 59% of the monitoring stations experienced groundwater declines as against 51% in the post monsoon season for the study area as a whole. this could be interpreted that the fluctuation is not a part of noise, but that a signal. is being identified. further, the trend result showed wide spatial and seasonal differences. irrespective of seasons, the consolidated rock formation that covers 80% of the geographical area experienced significant watertable decline. however, the semi consolidated and unconsolidated formations experienced watertable decline in the pre monsoon (summer) season only. the vulnerabte sites where the groundwater level declined significantly were identified so that recharge measures could be taken up.

Panday et al.,2009,Vadose Zone Journal,simulating dynamic water supply systems in a fully integrated surface subsurface flow and transport model,"groundwater pumping is a boundarycondition in groundwater models, and surface application, reuse, diversions, and water reclamation plant discharges are boundarycondition in hydrologic or hydraulic (i.e., surface) models. these processes can be simulated, however, as internal flow and solute transport components within a fully integrated groundwater surfacewater model. a methodology has been developed and incorporated into the modhms fully integrated surface subsurface modeling framework to enable evaluation of water distribution and application and impacts to water quality on surface and subsurface domains. this methodology allows the supply and delivery of water and associated water quality to be a part of the model solution rather than being predetermined boundarycondition to the system. furthermore, this methodology handles temporal and spatial changes to landuse and water quality and associated effects on outdoor water distribution, infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration properties that are related to surface cover or landuse classifications. this new methodology was applied to a portion of the upper santa clara river system and underlying groundwater basins of southern california to aid in the evaluation of a cl( ) total maximum daily load (tmdl) study. the outcome of this modeling evaluation has led to an enhanced understanding of how cl( ) is transported throughout the surface subsurface model domain and improved collaboration among stakeholders. the model serves as a powerful tool with which to develop and evaluate various approaches for the cl( ) tmdl implementation for the upper santa clara river system."
Park et al.,2009,Ground Water,analytical design curves to maximize pumping or minimize injection in coastal aquifers,"explicit algebraic equations are derived to determine approximate maximum pumping rates or minimum injection rates to limit sea water intrusion to a prespecified distance from the coastline. the equations are based on strack's (1976) single potential solution. the maximum pumping rates and minimum injection rates applied at wells with uniform spacing to control the inland movement of the fresh water salt water interface in a coastal aquifer could be calculated from strack's (1976) solution without the need of a numerical optimization algorithm. when wells are distributed in a simple fashion, the maximum intrusion location can be identified precisely for pumping cases and approximately for injection cases. for pumping cases, critical points are the limit of allowable salt water intrusion, whereas no such limit exists for injection cases. once an application site is identified, a series of design curves for pumping and injection rates can be developed for arbitrary intrusion limits. when a user is interested only in the largest pumping rates associated with critical points, one design curve can yield complete information."
Peranginangin et al.,2004,Journal of Hydrology,"water accounting for conjunctive groundwater/surfacewater management: case of the singkarak ombilin river basin, indonesia","because water shortages limit development in many parts of the world, a systematic approach is needed to use water more productively. to address this need, molden and sakthivadivel [water resour. dev. 15 (1999) 55 71] developed a water accounting procedure for analyzing water use patterns and tradeoffs between users. their procedure treats groundwater and surfacewater as a single domain. we adapted this procedure to account for groundwater and surfacewater components separately, and applied the adapted procedure to the singkarak ombilin river basin, indonesia, where groundwater is a significant part of the overall waterbalance. since 1998, a substantial proportion of water has been withdrawn from singkarak lake and diverted out of the basin, resulting in significant impacts on downstream water users and the lake ecosystem. based on 15 20 years (1980  1999) of hydrometeorological, landuse, soil, and other relevant data, a simple groundwaterbalance model was developed to generate the hydrogeologic information needed for the water accounting procedure. the water accounting procedure was then used to evaluate present and potential future water use performance in the basin. by considering groundwater and surfacewater components separately, a more realistic estimate of water availability was calculated than could be obtained by lumping these components together. results show that the diversion of 37 m(3)/s from singkarak lake increases the amount of water that is not available for other uses. such as for irrigation, from 57 81 to 81  95% of total water available in the basin. the new water accounting procedure also demonstrates the viability of increasing downstream water supply and water use performance during the dry months (june  september). for example, by increasing irrigation during the wet months (january april) or tapping water from a shallow, unconfined aquifer during the dry months, while keep maintaining sustainable groundwater levels.

Peters et al.,2005,Journal of Hydrology,drought in groundwater   drought distribution and performance indicators,"in order to investigate how droughts are changed by the groundwater system and to analyse the performance of groundwater during drought, 10 time series of 1000 years of recharge and groundwater discharge were generated. the 10 x 1000 years of synthetic daily data were generated using nearest neighbour resampling based on 37 years of observed daily meteorological data. the root zone was simulated by a non linear waterbalance model and the groundwater system by a linear reservoir model. the size and thus the response time of the reservoir was characterised by a reservoir coefficient. subsequently, the deficit and duration of the droughts were derived from the time series of recharge and groundwater discharge using the threshold level approach. an analysis of the distribution of these droughts shows that for droughts with small return periods, the deficit in the groundwater discharge is smaller than in the recharge. for droughts with large return periods, the deficit in the groundwater discharge is larger than in the recharge. the performance of groundwater systems with respect to droughts was evaluated using three classical performance indicators (reliability, resilience and vulnerability), a combination of these three indicators (loucks' sustainability index) and three newly defined overall performance indicators. the newly defined indicators combine the severity and frequency of the droughts, instead of analysing these separately in reliability and vulnerability. the performance is estimated for the groundwater recharge and for the discharge of groundwater systems with three different values of the reservoir coefficient. of all the performance indicators used, one of the newly introduced overall performance indicators with a strong emphasis on droughts with a high return period appeared to characterise the groundwater droughts best. this indicator shows a more or less constant performance for low and medium high reservoir coefficients and an increasing performance for higher reservoir coefficients.

Petheram et al.,2010,Water Resources Management,a continental scale assessment of australia's potential for irrigation,"debate about irrigation development of water resources in northern australia has been hampered by a lack of quantitative information to enable accurate assessment of the volume of water that could potentially be regulated in the 'north' (north of the tropic of capricorn). too often the debate focuses solely on streamflow volumes and quantities of runoff. in this paper we present simple calculations to estimate a representative irrigation requirement and the potential exploitable yield in each of the 12 drainage divisions of australia in order to more fully inform this on going debate. environmental, social, cultural and economic considerations are not examined. the results indicate that, despite northern australia generating approximately 64% of the continent's runoff, only 45% of australia's potentially exploitable yield is located in that portion of australia, due to unfavourable streamflow characteristics, storage constraints and large evaporation losses. if exploitable yield and irrigation requirement were the sole factors constraining sustainable irrigation, under a full development scenario, southern australia could hypothetically support an area of irrigation about 60% greater than that of northern australia (based on only 36% of the country's runoff). using 'best estimates' of rainfall and evapotranspiration projected under changes in climate resulting from a moderate emissions scenario, the percentage of australia's exploitable yield located in northern australia is estimated to increase from 45% to 47% by the year 2050, which equates to a 2% increase to the percentage of australia's hypothetical area of irrigation that could be located in northern australia. these results suggest that efforts towards achieving and developing sustainable irrigation practices in the south will remain most important in achieving australia's long term irrigation potential. this study also highlights the need for better regional scale information on the potential to regulate streamflow in australia, under current and future climates. such information is essential to guide policy and planning, future government and private investment, and to manage community expectations of australia's water resources."

Praveena et al.,2010,International Journal of Environmental Research,modeling for equitable groundwater management,freshwater lens on small islands may easily be overexploited or polluted due to overdrafts of fresh water by pumping which causes drawdown of the watertable a rise or up coning of the saltwater interface. present study is concerned with using a three dimensional finite difference numerical model to simulate the groundwater flow and transport model to predict the behavior of groundwater system in manukan island. the simulations were done using variable density seawat 2000 for three selected pumping schemes. hydraulic heads (groundwater level) is the highest at the center of the island and decreases in radial shape towards the coast in all the pumping schemes (ps1 ps3). the chloride concentration in the studied aquifer increased by 98.7% in the pumping well if the pumping rate is doubled by the current (ps2 to ps3). the 1.4% seawater freshwater mixing moves further forward to inland about 1.6m when the current pumping rate was doubled whereas moves backward to sea about 1.7m if the current pumping rate is reduced by 50%. this preliminary model of manukan island aquifer shows that an overexploitation of groundwater in manukan island contributes to the seawater intrusion. adjusting the future groundwater pumping scheme and improving groundwater management strategies are necessary to protect the freshwater aquifers. the current numerical model is a reasonable representation of the aquifer in small island which can be used in similar small islands with similar hydrogeological conditions in elsewhere.

Rivard et al.,2008,Water Resources Management,"characterization of a regional aquifer system in the maritimes basin, eastern canada","a regional hydrogeological study was carried out in the maritimes provinces, in one of the main aquifer systems in canada. the study area covers a land surface of 10,500 km(2), of which 9,400 km(2) is over carboniferous and younger rocks. the sedimentary fractured bedrock is composed of a sequence of discontinuous strata of highly variable hydraulic properties, and is overlain by a thin layer of glacial till (mostly 4 to 8 m). depending on areas, 46 to 100% of the population relies on groundwater for water supply. almost all residential wells are shallow (28 m on average) open holes that are cased only through the surficial sediments. this paper describes a regional hydrogeological investigation based on targeted fieldwork, the integration of a wide variety of existing multisource datasets and groundwater flow numerical modelling. the aim of this paper is to present the current state of understanding of the aquifer system in a representative area of the maritimes basin, along with the methodology used to characterize and analyze its distinct behaviour at the regional, local and point scales. this regional hydrogeological system contains confined and unconfined zones, and its aquifer lenticular strata extend only a few kilometers. preferential groundwater recharge occurs where sandy tills are present. the estimated mean annual recharge rate to the bedrock aquifers ranges between 130 and 165 mm/year. several geological formations of this basin provide good aquifers, with hydraulic conductivity in the range of 5x10( 6) 10( 4) m/s. based on numerical flow modelling, faults were interpreted to play a key role in the regional flow. pumping test results revealed that the aquifers can locally be very heterogeneous and anisotropic, but behave similarly to porous media. work performed at the local scale indicated that most water producing fractures generally have a sub horizontal dip along a north east (45) strike."

Rodell et al.,2009,Nature,satellite based estimates of groundwater depletion in india,"groundwater is a primary source of fresh water in many parts of the world. some regions are becoming overly dependent on it, consuming groundwater faster than it is naturally replenished and causing watertables to decline unremittingly(1). indirect evidence suggests that this is the case in northwest india(2), but there has been no regional assessment of the rate of groundwater depletion. here we use terrestrial water storage change observations from the nasa gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites(3) and simulated soil water variations from a data integrating hydrological modelling system(4) to show that groundwater is being depleted at a mean rate of 4.0 +/  1.0 cm yr( 1) equivalent height of water (17.7 +/  4.5 km(3) yr( 1)) over the indian states of rajasthan, punjab and haryana (including delhi). during our study period of august 2002 to october 2008, groundwater depletion was equivalent to a net loss of 109 km(3) of water, which is double the capacity of india's largest surfacewater reservoir. annual rainfall was close to normal throughout the period and we demonstrate that the other terrestrial water storage components (soil moisture, surfacewaters, snow, glaciers and biomass) did not contribute significantly to the observed decline in total water levels. although our observational record is brief, the available evidence suggests that unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the cause. if measures are not taken soon to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114,000,000 residents of the region may include a reduction of agricultural output and shortages of potable water, leading to extensive socioeconomic stresses."
Rodriguez et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrology,a distributed hydrological model for urbanized areas   model development and application to case studies,"the circulation of rainwater within urban areas has not yet been described in a detailed manner, as studies on this topic often remain limited to the runoff on impervious surfaces. the need for innovative and sustainable methods of water management has incited increased research efforts on the hydrological processes at work in urban areas. a distributed hydrological model based on information supplied by current urban databanks has been developed in this aim. the components of rainwater flux (i.e. surface runoff, soil runoff, drainage flow via the sewer, and evapotranspiration) as well as information on the hydric state of the urban soil (saturation level, storage capacity) are modeled at the parcel scale, and then coupled with a detailed description of the hydrographic network. this model runs continuously and has been intended to reproduce hydrological variables over very tong time series. in order to evaluate this model, it has been applied at two different scales, on two urban catchments of various landuse, where hydrological data were available. this evaluation is based on the comparison of observed and simulated flowrates and saturation levels, and details the various compartments (soil, impervious or natural areas) to the outflow. this study shows the importance of water fluxes often neglected in urban hydrology, such as the evapotranspiration or the soil infiltration into sewers. this first evaluation has highlighted the capability of mapping most of the hydrological fluxes on urban catchments, such as the capacity of soil to store water.

Romano et al.,2010,Ground Water,the sustainable pumping rate concept: lessons from a case study in central italy,"the term sustainable pumping rate (spr) is defined as the maximum pumping rate that can be maintained indefinitely without mining an aquifer, and is different from the concept of safe yield (sy), which takes into account also aspects related to the much wider concept of sustainability. the assessment of the spr for the case study of petrignano d'assisi, an alluvial aquifer located in central italy, shows the need for a reliable estimate of the global waterbudget of the aquifer, particularly of the recharge under undisturbed conditions; however, the latter is not sufficient, because the spr is affected also by the geometry of the aquifer, the hydraulic conductivity pattern, the variation of recharge/discharge ratio induced by the abstractions, and so on. all these aspects are analyzed by means of a numerical flow model calibrated both under undisturbed conditions (1974) and under exploitation conditions (1998 to 2004). the steady state modeling results show that the relation between recharge and abstractions both at local and global scale is a key point in order to estimate a long term spr. moreover, as it could be necessary to overexploit the aquifer for short periods, e.g., during drought episodes, the estimate of spr must be performed also in transient conditions, in order to take into account the characteristic time of depletion and the successive recovery."

Ruehl et al.,2006,Journal of Hydrology,differential gauging and tracer tests resolve seepage fluxes in a strongly losing stream,"the pajaro river, central coastal california, consistently loses 0.2 0.4 m(3)/s of discharge along an 11.42 km experimental reach late in the water year, when discharge is <= 4.5 m(3)/s. channel toss occurs throughout this reach, but is greatest in magnitude near the bottom of the reach. water isotopic data and other observations suggest that channel loss results mainly from streambed seepage, as opposed to evapotranspiration. if it occurs throughout the year, the channel loss along this short stream reach could contribute 6 13 x 10(6) m(3) of annual aquifer recharge, or similar to 20 40% of current sustainable basin yield. we performed a series of tracer injections along this reach to determine if hydrologic exchange occurs within this strongly losing stream. we found that during periods of high channel loss, there were also comparable storage exchange fluxes and lateral inflow of tracer free water. within upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, storage exchange fluxes are about 10 times greater than lateral inflow. the former are associated with the movement of water between the main channel and surface or subsurface storage zones. in this system, it is likely that the tatter are primarily associated with spatially  or temporally long subsurface flow paths within the shallow streambed, as opposed to inflow of groundwater from deeper in the basin. along both upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, lateral inflow tends to increase as channel discharge decreases. in contrast, storage exchange fluxes increase with decreasing discharge along the upper parts of the reach, but decrease with decreasing discharge along the lower parts. gauging and tracer test results suggest that subsurface storage exchange and loss may occur simultaneously, and that the lateral inflow of tracer free water can be caused by long scale subsurface flow as well as groundwater making its first appearance in the channel.

Rusinga et al.,2005,Water Sa,groundwater resource evaluation of urban bulawayo aquifer,"judicious management of a groundwater system requires an understanding of its hydrogeology and response to various recharge and pumping stresses. however, in developing countries, groundwater resource evaluations are hampered by a lack of adequate data that will allow for its complete characterisation. under such circumstances it is not uncommon for ad hoc groundwater management measures to be embarked upon, especially during drought conditions. these were the conditions that existed during the 1991/92 drought when the csir stellenbosch evaluated the groundwater resources of an urban aquifer in bulawayo, zimbabwe. their recommendations revealed that about 3.5x10(6) m(3)/a could be safely abstracted from the aquifer. in this work, a more comprehensive hydrogeological investigation was carried out which included pumping tests, estimation of abstraction rates and recharges, and numerical modelling of the aquifer. the investigations indicate that the aquifer is unconfined with hydraulic conductivity and specific yield ranging from 0.1 m/d to 2.09 m/d and 0.02 to 0.11, respectively. recharge estimates indicate an annual recharge of 105.5 mm with 38.4%, 52.1% and 9.5% accounting respectively for direct recharge, water mains and sewer leakages. furthermore, a long term sustainable annual abstraction of 6.1x10(6) m(3) or 15% of current city water demand can be obtained from the aquifer."
Saeed et al.,2005,Agricultural Water Management,"feasible design and operational guidelines for skimming wells in the indus basin, pakistan","this paper reports work done to assess the status of groundwater extraction technologies and practices in the indus basin of pakistan and hence to improve these technologies for sustainable groundwater extraction. a socio technical approach was used which involved a field survey using participatory rural appraisal (pra), monitoring of existing farmers' wells for hydraulic and hydrosalinity behavior of these wells, and simulating hydrosalinity behavior under skimming wells using appropriate groundwater and solute transport models. the data collected in pra shows a variety of wells designs, which reflects the absence of design code for these wells. consequently, farmers have to choose one of the design options provided by the local drillers. we monitored a farmer's operation of a multi borehole skimming well to extract groundwater to supplement canal water. most of the time the well was operated daily, and occasionally on alternate days. the number of operating hours varied from 2 to 12 h per pumping event. we also conducted pumping tests in two wells, one with a single borehole, and another with six boreholes. the data obtained at these two wells were used to develop guidelines for well design and operation using a flow model, modflow and a solute transport model, mt3d. the parameters considered in the model studies were as follows: perforated well depth with respect to depth of the freshwater layer in the aquifer (i.e. well penetration ratio), number of boreholes and spatial distance between them in a multi borehole well system, well discharge rate and daily operational hours. the results indicate that a single borehole well operated at a discharge rate of ranging from 32 to 180 m(3)/h (9 501/s) can be operated successfully with a 30 60% well penetration ratio for an operating time of 4 8 h/day where the thickness of the freshwater layer ranges from 20 to 30 m. multi borehole wells consisting of four to eight boreholes at a spacing of 3 m can be installed where the thickness of the freshwater layer ranges from 10 to 20 m without compromising the quantity and quality of pumped water.

Salman et al.,2008,Water Policy,limits of pricing policy in curtailing household water consumption under scarcity conditions,"a key policy question in designing urban water policy and institutional reforms is: what should be the appropriate structure of water charges to ensure long term sustainability of water service? this is because water pricing touches on equity and on the willingness of the consumer to pay, but more on its affordability. this study focuses on understanding the nature of household demand for water, and attempts to express the household demand functions. a panel of data of 10,564 complete observations on water bills, drawn from a household expenditure survey conducted in 2003, is used to estimate domestic water demand function. price and other dummy variables were used in the analysis and the results discussed. specifically, the household water demand and the per capita demand are analysed, taking into consideration such variables as marginal price, rate structure premium and level of household income. the results show that the estimated water demand is inelastic and so is the income elasticity. the effect of the findings on water policy making in regard to pricing is cited. limitations of price effectiveness as a tool to curtail water consumption are highlighted."
Sanz et al.,2009,Hydrogeology Journal,hydrostratigraphic framework and hydrogeological behaviour of the mancha oriental system (se spain),"the mancha oriental system (mos) has a surface area of 7,260 km(2), making it one of the largest carbonate aquifer systems in spain. the system sustains about 1,000 km(2) of irrigated crops and supplies groundwater to 275,000 inhabitants. the economic transformation brought about by the development of extensive irrigated cropland has led to a waterbalance disequilibrium of about 75 million m(3)/year. this input output deficit has negative consequences in the quantity and quality of the available resources, in the river aquifer relationship, and in the associated ecosystems as well. to understand the hydrogeological behaviour of the system, it is necessary to design a conceptual model. further, the conceptualisation of a groundwater flow system is a requirement of the european water framework directive for the characterisation of groundwater bodies. the robustness of the conceptual model depends heavily on the user capability of representing the real system. in this work, a multidisciplinary approach has been used to represent the three dimensional geological framework and the groundwater flow conceptualisation of the mos. data management and three dimensional visualisation have been carried out by means of geographical information system (gis) tools and software for contouring and three dimensional surface mapping."
Sasaki et al.,2006,Geophysical Journal International,a multidimensional horizontal loop controlled source electromagnetic inversion method and its use to characterize heterogeneity in aquiferous fractured crystalline rocks,"the controlled source dual horizontal loop harmonic electromagnetic (hlem) profiling method is well suited to the problem of investigating fracture zones in crystalline rocks but there are still limitations in the way that experimental data are currently interpreted the use of 1 d data inversion leads to inaccurate determination of geological structure. to allow accurate characterization of zones of fractured rock especially underneath heterogeneous overburden, we have developed an efficient 2.5 d regularized inversion method for reconstructing subsurface electrical resistivity distributions from multifrequency hlem data, with the forward problem solved in 3 d using a staggered grid finite difference method. the inversion method is validated using a synthetic example and practical data sets from four borehole sites in a granitic terrain in northeast brazil. an appraisal of our results for sites with boreholes sited using conventional data analysis procedures shows that we can distinguish between optimally located productive wells in fracture zone lineaments and those with diminished yields in weathered layer with no major underlying fracture zones. we suggest that 2.5 d inversion can aid in developing better strategies for sustainable groundwater resource development in the basement terrains."
Scanlon et al.,2010,Water Resources Research,"effects of irrigated agroecosystems: 2. quality of soil water and groundwater in the southern high plains, texas","trade offs between water resource depletion and salinization need to be understood when promoting water conservative irrigation practices. this companion paper assesses impacts of groundwater fed irrigation on soil water and groundwater quality using data from the southern high plains (shp). unsaturated zone soil samples from 13 boreholes beneath irrigated agroecosystems were analyzed for water extractable anions. salt accumulation in soils varies with irrigation water quality, which ranges from low salinity in the north (median cl: 21 mg/l) to higher salinity in the south (median cl: 180 mg/l). large cl bulges under irrigated agroecosystems in the south are similar to those under natural ecosystems, but they accumulated over decades rather than millennia typical of natural ecosystems. profile peak cl concentrations (1200 6400 mg/l) correspond to irrigation efficiencies of 92 98% with respect to drainage and are attributed to deficit irrigation with minimal flushing. perchlorate (clo(4)) also accumulates under irrigated agroecosystems, primarily from irrigation water, and behaves similarly to cl. most no(3) n accumulation is below the root zone. groundwater total dissolved solids (tds) have increased by <= 960 mg/l and no(3) nby <= 9.4 mg/l since the early 1960s. mobilization of salts that have accumulated under irrigated agroecosystems is projected to degrade groundwater much more in the future because of the essentially closed basin status of the aquifer, with discharge occurring primarily through irrigation pumpage. tds are projected to increase by an additional 2200 mg/l (median), clo(4) by 21 mu g/l, and no(3) n by 52 mg/l. water and salt balances should be considered in irrigation management in order to minimize salinization issues."
Scanlon et al.,2007,Water Resources Research,global impacts of conversions from natural to agricultural ecosystems on water resources: quantity versus quality,"[1] past landuse changes have greatly impacted global water resources, with often opposing effects on water quantity and quality. increases in rain fed cropland (460%) and pastureland (560%) during the past 300 years from forest and grasslands decreased evapotranspiration and increased recharge ( two orders of magnitude) and streamflow ( one order of magnitude). however, increased water quantity degraded water quality by mobilization of salts, salinization caused by shallow watertables, and fertilizer leaching into underlying aquifers that discharge to streams. since the 1950s, irrigated agriculture has expanded globally by 174%, accounting for similar to 90% of global freshwater consumption. irrigation based on surfacewater reduced streamflow and raised watertables resulting in waterlogging in many areas ( china, india, and united states). marked increases in groundwater fed irrigation in the last few decades in these areas has lowered watertables ( <= 1 m/yr) and reduced streamflow. degradation of water quality in irrigated areas has resulted from processes similar to those in rain fed agriculture: salt mobilization, salinization in waterlogged areas, and fertilizer leaching. strategies for remediating water resource problems related to agriculture often have opposing effects on water quantity and quality. long time lags ( decades to centuries) between landuse changes and system response ( e. g., recharge, streamflow, and water quality), particularly in semiarid regions, mean that the full impact of landuse changes has not been realized in many areas and remediation to reverse impacts will also take a long time. future landuse changes should consider potential impacts on water resources, particularly trade offs between water, salt, and nutrient balances, to develop sustainable water resources to meet human and ecosystem needs."
Scanlon et al.,2006,Hydrological Processes,global synthesis of groundwater recharge in semiarid and arid regions,"global synthesis of the findings from similar to 140 recharge study areas in semiarid and and regions provides important information on recharge rates, controls, and processes, which are critical for sustainable water development. water resource evaluation, dryland salinity assessment (australia), and radioactive waste disposal (us) are among the primary goals of many of these recharge studies. the chloride mass balance (cmb) technique is widely used to estimate recharge. average recharge rates estimated over large areas (40 374 000 km(2)) range from 0.2 to 35 mm. year( 1), representing 0.1 5% of long term average annual precipitation. extreme local variability in recharge, with rates up to similar to 720 m year( 1), results from focussed recharge beneath ephemeral streams and lakes and preferential flow mostly in fractured systems. system response to climate variability and landuse/land cover (lu/lc) changes is archived in unsaturated zone tracer profiles and in groundwater level fluctuations. inter annual climate variability related to el nino southern oscillation (enso) results in up to three times higher recharge in regions within the sw us during periods of frequent el ninos (1977 1998) relative to periods dominated by la ninas (1941 1957). enhanced recharge related to enso is also documented in argentina. climate variability at decadal to century scales recorded in chloride profiles in africa results in recharge rates of 30 mm year( 1) during the sahel drought (1970 1986) to 150 mm year( 1) during non drought periods. variations in climate at millennial scales in the sw us changed systems from recharge during the pleistocene glacial period ( : 10 000 years ago) to discharge during the holocene semiarid period. lu/lc changes such as deforestation in australia increased recharge up to about 2 orders of magnitude. changes from natural grassland and shrublands to dryland (rain fed) agriculture altered systems from discharge (evapotranspiration, et) to recharge in the sw us. the impact of lu change was much greater than climate variability in niger (africa), where replacement of savanna by crops increased recharge by about an order of magnitude even during severe droughts. sensitivity of recharge to lu/lc changes suggests that recharge may be controlled through management of lu. in irrigated areas, recharge varies from 10 to 485 mm year 1, representing 1 25% of irrigation plus precipitation. however, irrigation pumpage in groundwater fed irrigated areas greatly exceeds recharge rates, resulting in groundwater mining. increased recharge related to cultivation has mobilized salts that accumulated in the unsaturated zone over millennia, resulting in widespread groundwater and surfacewater contamination, particularly in australia. the synthesis of recharge rates provided in this study contains valuable information for developing sustainable groundwater resource programmes within the context of climate variability and lu/lc change. copyright (c) 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd."
Scanlon et al.,2010,Hydrogeology Journal,"groundwater recharge in natural dune systems and agricultural ecosystems in the thar desert region, rajasthan, india","water and nutrient availability for crop production are critical issues in (semi)arid regions. unsaturated zone cl tracer data and nutrient (no3 and po4) concentrations were used to quantify recharge rates using the cl mass balance approach and nutrient availability in the thar desert, rajasthan, india. soil cores were collected in dune/interdune settings in the arid thar desert (near jaisalmer) and in rain fed (nonirrigated) and irrigated cropland in the semiarid desert margin (near jaipur). recharge rates were also simulated using unsaturated zone modeling. recharge rates in sparsely vegetated dune/interdune settings in the jaisalmer study area are 2.7 5.6 mm/year (2 3% of precipitation, 165 mm/year). in contrast, recharge rates in rain fed agriculture in the jaipur study area are 61 94 mm/year (10 16% of precipitation, 600 mm/year). minimum recharge rates under current freshwater irrigated sites are 50 120 mm/year (8 20% of precipitation). nitrate concentrations are low at most sites. similarity in recharge rates based on so4 with those based on cl is attributed to a meteoric origin of so4 and generally conservative chemical behavior in these sandy soils. modeling results increased confidence in tracer based recharge estimates. recharge rates under rain fed agriculture indicate that irrigation of 20 40% of cultivated land with 300 mm/year should be sustainable."
Scanlon et al.,2010,Water Resources Research,"effects of irrigated agroecosystems: 1. quantity of soil water and groundwater in the southern high plains, texas","although irrigated agriculture is the primary consumer of global groundwater resources, information on recharge rates and sustainable irrigation is limited. the study objective was to fingerprint irrigation return flow to quantify percolation/recharge and to estimate sustainable irrigation levels. this paper focuses on water quantity; a companion paper addresses water quality. soil samples from 13 boreholes drilled beneath irrigated agroecosystems in the southern high plains were analyzed for matric potential and water extractable cl and no3. unsaturated zone pore water beneath irrigated agroecosystems can be fingerprinted by higher matric potentials (wetter soils, median mp:  40 m) and higher no3 n (median 71 mg/l) than beneath natural ecosystems (mp  200 m; no3 n 8.1 mg/l) and by higher cl (720 mg/l) than beneath rain fed agroecosystems (8.4 mg/l). the range in percolation/recharge rates beneath irrigated agroecosystems is 18 97 mm/a (median 41 mm/a; 5% of irrigation + precipitation) and occurs primarily in response to extreme precipitation events. similarity in percolation/recharge rates beneath irrigated and rain fed (4.8 92 mm/a) agroecosystems was unexpected and is attributed to low irrigation applications (median 300 mm/a) and increased crop yield and evapotranspiration in irrigated areas. regional watertable declines are unsustainably large (>= 30 m over 10,000 km(2)) in the north and are much lower in the south. sustainable irrigation in the south would require reduction of the irrigated area from 23% to 9%. methods developed for quantifying recharge and sustainable irrigation application rates can be applied to groundwater fed irrigated areas in semiarid regions globally."

Schirmer et al.,2007,Grundwasser,urban hydrogeology   challenges in research and practice,"urban areas are a focus of increasing conflict with regard to water use and water protection. half of the world's population and about 73% of europeans live in cities. currently, about 82% of the total population growth of the world occurs in the cities of the developing countries (un 2004). as a direct and/or indirect consequence of human activity, urban water systems are frequently polluted with organic contaminants. many of these contaminants are related to human behaviour and activity, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products (collectively ppcps) and endocrine active substances, and are increasingly found in urban water systems. however, the behaviour and the effects of these contaminants in the environment have been widely unknown until now. consequently, it is important to pay more attention to such substances and to explore new integrated methodologies (including flux calculations as well as chemical and biological investigations) for determining the impact of human activities on urban water systems and on processes within the urban watershed. the overall goal is to assess the risks to humans and the ecosystem, and to support the development of suitable management strategies."
Schoups et al.,2006,Water Resources Research,reliable conjunctive use rules for sustainable irrigated agriculture and reservoir spill control,"we develop optimal conjunctive use water management strategies that balance two potentially conflicting objectives: sustaining irrigated agriculture during droughts and minimizing unnecessary spills and resulting water losses from the reservoir during wet periods. conjunctive use is specified by a linear operating rule, which determines the maximum surfacewater release as a function of initial reservoir storage. optimal strategies are identified using multiobjective interannual optimization for sustainability and spill control, combined with gradient based annual profit maximization. application to historical conditions in the irrigated system of the yaqui valley, mexico, yields a pareto curve of solutions illustrating the trade off between sustaining agriculture and minimizing spills and water losses. minimal water losses are obtained by maximizing surfacewater use and limiting groundwater pumping, such that reservoir levels are kept sufficiently low. maximum agricultural sustainability, on the other hand, results from increased groundwater use and keeping surfacewater reservoir levels high during wet periods. selected optimal operating rules from the multiobjective optimization are tested over a large number of equally probable streamflow time series, generated with a stochastic time series model. in this manner, statistical properties, such as the mean sustainability and sustainability percentiles, are determined for each optimal rule. these statistical properties can be used to select rules for water management that are reliable over a wide range of streamflow conditions."
Schoups et al.,2006,Water Resources Research,"sustainable conjunctive water management in irrigated agriculture: model formulation and application to the yaqui valley, mexico","[ 1] this paper investigates strategies to alleviate the effects of droughts on the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture. these strategies include conjunctive management of surfacewater and groundwater resources, and engineered improvements such as lining of irrigation canals and addition of regional pumping well capacity. a spatially distributed simulation optimization model was developed for an irrigated system consisting of multiple surfacewater reservoirs and an alluvial aquifer. the simulation model consists of an agronomic component and simulators describing the hydrologic system. the physical models account for storage and flow through the reservoirs, routing through the irrigation canals, and regional groundwater flow. the agronomic model describes crop productivity as a function of irrigation quantity and salinity, and determines agricultural profit. a profit maximization problem was formulated and solved using large scale constrained gradient based optimization. the model was applied to a real world conjunctive surfacewater/groundwater management problem in the yaqui valley, an irrigated agricultural region in sonora, mexico. the model reproduces recorded reductions in agricultural production during a historical drought. these reductions were caused by a decline in surfacewater availability and limited installed pumping capacity. results indicate that the impact of the historical 8 year drought could have been significantly reduced without affecting profit in wet years by better managing surfacewater and groundwater resources. namely, groundwater could have been more heavily relied upon and surfacewater allocation capped at a sustainable level as an operating rule. lining the irrigation canals would have resulted in water savings of 30% of historical reservoir releases during wet years, which could have been used in subsequent drier years to increase agricultural production. the benefits of a greater reliance on groundwater pumping by installing additional wells are limited due to pumping restrictions near the coast to avoid seawater intrusion and due to increased pumping costs."

Seward et al.,2010,Ground Water,challenges facing environmentally sustainable groundwater use in south africa,"in 1998, south africa promulgated a water act that is widely regarded as one of the most progressive and enabling pieces of environmental legislation in the world. the environmental aspects of the water act are commonly referred to as ""resource directed measures."" these measures attempt to find the right balance between (1) leaving water in the resource (""nonconsumptive use"") to provide ecological goods and services for society and (2) taking the water out of the system for ""consumptive"" human use. these measures also attempt to ensure that both nonconsumptive and consumptive use is sustainable. this article discusses some of the challenges faced in using the measures to achieve environmentally sustainable groundwater use. a major challenge is that misunderstanding still abounds regarding the environmental aims of this legislation. other major challenges identified included a severe shortage of technical capacity, an inordinately long water use license application process, incorporating adaptivemanagement to deal with uncertainty, incorporating the public participation process, and revising policy implementation processes to accommodate highly localized aquifers. selecting appropriate scientific methodology neither too simplistic nor too involved is a recurring challenge. it is suggested that an important part of addressing these and the other challenges identified is a period of reflection and dialogue between the various sectors involved."

Singh et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,decision support for on farm water management and long term agricultural sustainability in a semi arid region of india,"the long term success of irrigated agriculture for sustainable crop production in india depends largely on the careful management of land and water resources. currently, some serious environmental problems of waterlogging and soil salinization are burgeoning in parts of haryana state of india: half a million hectare area of the state is already waterlogged. poor irrigation and drainage management and inadequate exploitation of saline groundwater are the main factors responsible for this phenomenon. in order to prevent further degradation and to maintain the food production for the growing population, judicious use of natural resources is a must. a wide range of solutions could be considered to address the problems. but the effectiveness of all the solutions and their combinations cannot be verified with on farm experiments. simulation models by way of their predictive capability are often the only viable means of providing input to management decisions. these models can help to forecast the likely impacts of a particular alternative management strategy. in the present study a physical based one dimensional simulation model swasalt was employed to evaluate on farm irrigation water management options. after successful calibration and validation with field experimentation data, several scenario building exercises have been conducted under different crop, soil and rainfall conditions. the water and salt balance component obtained for each simulation run were used to derive water management response indicators. the simulation study revealed that in most conditions, saline water of up to 7.5 ds/m can be used safely on long term basis for crop production. the simulation study further revealed that alternative use of canal and saline water had an edge over mix use. several alternatives have been suggested for sustainable agricultural production in the region. the strategies suggested, if followed, would lend sustainability to the agricultural production besides substantial increase in production and water resources conservation, by impeding the environmental hazard of waterlogging and soil salinization.

Stannard et al.,2010,Journal of Hydrology,consumptive use and resulting leach field waterbudget of a mountain residence,"consumptive use of water in a dispersed rural community has important implications for maximum housing density and its effects on sustainability of groundwater withdrawals. recent rapid growth in colorado, usa has stressed groundwater supplies in some areas, thereby increasing scrutiny of approximate methods developed there more than 30 years ago to estimate consumptive use that are still used today. a foothills residence was studied during a 2 year period to estimate direct and indirect water losses. direct losses are those from evaporation inside the home, plus any outdoor use. indirect loss is evapotranspiration (et) from the residential leach field in excess of et from the immediately surrounding terrain. direct losses were 18.7% of water supply to the home, substantially larger than estimated historically in colorado. a new approach was developed to estimate indirect loss, using chamber methods together with the penman monteith model. indirect loss was only 0.9% of water supply, but this value probably was anomalously low due to a recurring leach field malfunction. resulting drainage beneath the leach field was 80.4% of water supply. guidelines are given to apply the same methodology at other sites and combine results with a survey of leach fields in an area to obtain more realistic average values of et losses. published by elsevier b.v."

Steward et al.,2009,Water Resources Research,groundwater response to changing water use practices in sloping aquifers using convolution of transient response functions,"this study examines the impact of a sloping base on the movement of transients through groundwater systems. dimensionless variables and regression of model results are employed to develop functions relating the transient change in saturated thickness to the distance upgradient and downgradient from recharge or withdrawal. convolution of these transient response functions (made possible due to linearity of partial differential equations in the model) enables computation of changes in saturated thickness over recharge/withdrawal that varies over space and time. establishing the criteria and form of these functions led to the discovery of fundamental underlying properties: upgradient and downgradient responses may be scaled to achieve a symmetrical relationship, expressions are developed to compute change in saturated thickness at the location of water use, and downgradient response at large times form a s shaped curve that effectively adds a diffusive component to the average velocity of the kinematic wave approximation, where the hydraulic gradient is equal to the bed slope. hydrogeologic data for three study regions in the high plains aquifer are summarized, and model results are presented for changes in saturated thickness. the transient response functions are used to reconstruct and interpret groundwater response to historical water use practices and to predict future changes in saturated thickness for a series of hypothetical alternative water use scenarios. depressions in groundwater elevation are observed both upgradient and downgradient from areas of high water use; however, these depressions preferentially move downgradient over time and may continue to spread downgradient far into the future. this approach quantifies and provides understanding of the impacts of changes in natural and anthropogenic hydrologic forcings on aquifer systems."
Stigter et al.,2009,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,screening of sustainable groundwater sources for integration into a regional drought prone water supply system,"this paper reports on the qualitative and quantitative screening of groundwater sources for integration into the public water supply system of the algarve, portugal. the results are employed in a decision support system currently under development for an integrated water resources management scheme in the region. such a scheme is crucial for several reasons, including the extreme seasonal and annual variations in rainfall, the effect of climate change on more frequent and long lasting droughts, the continuously increasing water demand and the high risk of a single source water supply policy. the latter was revealed during the severe drought of 2004 and 2005, when surface reservoirs were depleted and the regional water demand could not be met, despite the drilling of emergency wells. for screening and selection, quantitative criteria are based on aquifer properties and well yields, whereas qualitative criteria are defined by water quality indices. these reflect the well's degree of violation of drinking water standards for different sets of variables, including toxicity parameters, nitrate and chloride, iron and manganese and microbiological parameters. results indicate the current availability of at least 1100 l s( 1) of high quality groundwater (55% of the regional demand), requiring only disinfection (900 l s( 1)) or basic treatment, prior to human consumption. these groundwater withdrawals are sustainable when compared to mean annual recharge, considering that at least 40% is preserved for ecological demands. a more accurate and comprehensive analysis of sustainability is performed with the help of steady state and transient groundwater flow simulations, which account for aquifer geometry, boundarycondition, recharge and discharge rates, pumping activity and seasonality. they permit an advanced analysis of present and future scenarios and show that increasing water demands and decreasing rainfall will make the water supply system extremely vulnerable, with a high risk of groundwater salinization and ecosystem degradation."
Stuart et al.,2010,Applied Geochemistry,groundwater residence time and movement in the maltese islands   a geochemical approach,"the maltese islands are composed of two limestone aquifers, the upper and lower coralline limestone separated by an aquitard, the 'blue clay'. the lower coralline limestone is overlain in part by the poorly permeable globigerina limestone. the upper perched aquifers are discontinuous and have very limited saturated thickness and a short water level response time to rainfall. frequent detections of coliforms suggest a rapid route to groundwater. however, the unsaturated zone has a considerable thickness in places and the primary porosity of the upper coralline limestone is high, so there is likely to be older recharge by slow matrix flow as well as rapid recharge from fractures. measurement of sf(6) from a pumping station in a deep part of one of the perched aquifers indicated a mean saturated zone age of about 15 a. the main sea level aquifers (msl) on both malta and gozo have a large unsaturated thickness as water levels are close to sea level. on malta, parts of the aquifer are capped by the perched aquifers and more extensively by the globigerina limestone. the limited detection of coliform bacteria suggests only some rapid recharge from the surface via fractures or karst features. transmissivity is low and (3)h and cfc/sf(6) data indicate that saturated zone travel times are in the range 15 40 a. on gozo the aquifer is similar but is more extensively capped by impermeable blue clay. cfc data show the saturated zone travel time is from 25 a to possibly more than 60 a. groundwater age is clearly related to the extent of low permeability cover. the delta(13)c signature of groundwater is related to the geochemical processes which occur along the flowpath and is consistent with residence time ages in the sequence; perched aquifers < malta msl < gozo msl the (18)o and (2)h enriched isotopic signature of post 1983 desalinated water can be seen in more modern groundwater, particularly the urbanized areas of the perched and malta msl aquifers. in all aquifers, movement of solutes from the surface travelling slowly through the matrix provide a long term source of groundwater contaminants such as no(3).

Sultan et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrology,"geochemical, isotopic, and remote sensing constraints on the origin and evolution of the rub al khali aquifer system, arabian peninsula","chemical and stable isotopic compositions of groundwater samples from the rub at khali (rak) in southern saudi arabia were analyzed. samples were collected from wells of variable depth (1.5 800 m) along the perimeter of the eastern half of the rak including flowing artesian wells, pumped wells (formerly artesian), and shallow hand dug wells encompassing those in sabkha areas. data indicate that the water from the artesian and formerly artesian wells represents the contents of confined aquifers. such water (group 1) is isotopicatly depleted (delta(2)h values ranging from  60 parts per thousand. to  35 parts per thousand), and has total dissolved solids (tds) concentrations ranging from 1300 to 76,000 mg/l, indicating that much of the salinity is acquired in the subsurface. water from shallow hand dug wells including those in sabkha areas (group 2) has experienced significant evaporation (5 2 h values ranging from  34 parts per thousand to +19 parts per thousand as well as salinization (tds as high as 92,000 mg/l) by dissolution of sabkha salts including halite and gypsum. stable isotope data for the group 2 water samples define an evaporation trend line originating from the group 1 water samples. this relationship indicates that the group 2 type water evolved from group 1 type water by ascending through structural discontinuities, dissolving evaporative salts, and undergoing substantial near surface evaporation in groundwater discharge zones (sabkhas) characterized by shallow groundwater levels (<2 m). this interpretation is supported by the relatively unradiogenic sr isotope ratios of groundwater samples (sr(87)/sr(86) = 0.70771 0.70874) that are inconsistent with that of modern seawater ((87)sr/(86)sr = 0.70932). the rak aquifer water represents either high elevation recharge from the red sea hills, and/or recharge largely formed of paleo water precipitated during moist climate intervals of the late pleistocene recharging aquifers cropping out at the foothills of the red sea mountains. this inference is supported by a progressive decrease in hydraulic head and increase in groundwater salinity from west to east, substantial precipitation over the red sea hills, and a major e w trending channel network that channels precipitation from the red sea hills toward recharge areas. analysis of 3 hourly trmm (tropical rainfall measuring mission: 1998 2006) precipitation data and digital elevation data shows that 27% of the average annual precipitation (150 x 10(9) m(3)) over the arabian peninsula is channeled toward the recharge zone of the rak aquifer system, of which an estimated 4 x 10(9) m(3) a( 1) to 10 x 10(9) m(3) a( 1) of this water is partitioned as recharge to the rak aquifer system. additional integrated studies on recharge rates, sustainability, and water quality issues for the rak aquifers could demonstrate that the rak is one of the most promising sites for groundwater exploration in the arabian peninsula. results highlight the importance of investigating the potential for sustainable exploitation of similar large aquifer systems that were largely recharged in previous wet climatic periods yet are still receiving modest modern meteoric contributions.

Sultan et al.,2007,Journal of Hydrology,natural discharge: a key to sustainable utilization of fossil groundwater,"rising demands for fresh water supplies in and lands are leading to excessive exploitation and unsustainable mining of non renewable fossil groundwater. using the nubian aquifer of saharan africa as a test site, we demonstrate an integrated approach to identify areas of discharge that could have gone undetected, and to model extraction that is sustained by natural discharge. using isotopic and geochemical analyses along with field and remote sensing data we show that discharge of the nubian aquifer is occurring on a larger scale, primarily through deep seated fault systems, and that ascending groundwater discharges into relatively thick alluvial aquifers proximal to the fault complex that defines the river nile and the gulf of suez. we develop a hydrologic model to assess the discharge and to constrain sustainable extraction in the asyuti area along the river nile and to demonstrate a replicable model for similar reservoirs. a two dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed and calibrated against head data from 19 wells. results point to a significant contribution to the asyuti groundwater system from rising nubian groundwater (3.19 x 10(7) m(3)/yr: 75% of incoming flow) and a modest contribution (1.08 x 10(7) m(3)/yr: 25% of incoming flow) from surface runoff. approximately 2.5 x 10(7) m(3)/yr of groundwater could be used in a sustainable manner in asyuti. assuming geologic settings and discharge rates similar to those at asyuti, we estimate that 70 x 10(7) m(3)/yr of groundwater may be available for sustainable development in similar settings around the river nile and the gulf of suez.

Tilahun et al.,2009,Hydrogeology Journal,"estimation of groundwater recharge using a gis based distributed waterbalance model in dire dawa, ethiopia","sustainable groundwater management requires knowledge of recharge. recharge is also an important parameter in groundwater flow and transport models. spatial variation in recharge due to distributed land us.e, soil texture, topography, groundwater level, and hydrometeorological conditions should be accounted for in recharge estimation. however, conventional point estimates of recharge are not easily extrapolated or regionalized. in this study, a spatially distributed waterbalance model wetspass was used to simulate long term average recharge using landuse, soil texture, topography, and hydrometeorological parameters in dire dawa, a semiarid region of ethiopia. wetspass is a physically based methodology for estimation of the long term average spatial distribution of surface runoff, actual evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge. the long term temporal and spatial average annual rainfall of 626 mm was distributed as: surface runoff of 126 mm (20%), evapotranspiration of 468 mm (75%), and recharge of 28 mm (5%). this recharge corresponds to 817 l/s for the 920.12 km(2) study area, which is less than the often assumed 1,000 l/s recharge for the dire dawa groundwater catchment."
Tizro et al.,2008,Hydrological Processes,"groundwater quality in the semi arid region of the chahardouly basin, west iran","chahardouly basin is located in the western part of iran and is characterized by semi arid climatic conditions and scarcity in water resources. the main aquifer systems are developed within alluvial deposits. the availability of groundwater is rather erratic owing to the occurrence of hard rock formation and a saline zone in some parts of the area. the aquifer systems of the area show signs of depletion, which have taken place in recent years due to a decline in water levels. groundwater samples collected from shallow and deep wells were analysed to examine the quality characteristics of groundwater. the major ion chemistry of groundwater is dominated by ca2+ and hco3  while higher values of total dissolved solids (tds) in groundwater are associated with high concentrations of all major ions. an increase in salinity is recorded in the down gradient part of the basin. the occurrence of saline groundwater, as witnessed by the high electrical conductivity (ec), may be attributed to the long residence time of water and the dissolution of minerals, as well as evaporation of rainfall and irrigation return flow. based on sar values and sodium content (%na), salinity appears to be responsible for the poor groundwater quality, rendering most of the samples not suitable for irrigation use. copyright (c) 2007 john wiley & sons, ltd."

Tonkin et al.,2005,Water Resources Research,a hybrid regularized inversion methodology for highly parameterized environmental models,"[1] a hybrid approach to the regularized inversion of highly parameterized environmental models is described. the method is based on constructing a highly parameterized base model, calculating base parameter sensitivities, and decomposing the base parameter normal matrix into eigenvectors representing principal orthogonal directions in parameter space. the decomposition is used to construct super parameters. super parameters are factors by which principal eigenvectors of the base parameter normal matrix are multiplied in order to minimize a composite least squares objective function. these eigenvectors define orthogonal axes of a parameter subspace for which information is available from the calibration data. the coordinates of the solution are sought within this subspace. super parameters are estimated using a regularized nonlinear gauss marquardt levenberg scheme. though super parameters are estimated, tikhonov regularization constraints are imposed on base parameters. tikhonov regularization mitigates over fitting and promotes the estimation of reasonable base parameters. use of a large number of base parameters enables the inversion process to be receptive to the information content of the calibration data, including aspects pertaining to small scale parameter variations. because the number of super parameters sustainable by the calibration data may be far less than the number of base parameters used to define the original problem, the computational burden for solution of the inverse problem is reduced. the hybrid methodology is described and applied to a simple synthetic groundwater flow model. it is then applied to a real world groundwater flow and contaminant transport model. the approach and programs described are applicable to a range of modeling disciplines."

Van Camp et al.,2010,Agricultural Water Management,assessment of groundwater storage depletion by overexploitation using simple indicators in an irrigated closed aquifer basin in iran,"in arid and semi arid regions irrigation is usually needed to provide enough water for crop growth in cultivated areas. as surfacewaters are scarce, especially in summertime when the water is needed, groundwater is heavily used to supply the water demand. overexploitation of the aquifer in dry years causes depletion of the groundwater storage and systematical lowering of the piezometric levels. this is a particular problem in aquifers developed in closed basins where lateral inflow is nearly absent and replenishment is constrained by rainfall recharge. in this paper, simple indicators derived from meteorological data, abstraction rates and piezometric time series are compared with the groundwater storage depletion as obtained from a calibrated groundwater flow model. application of the method to the overexploited shahrekord basin in iran shows that for the simulated period 1989 2003 an accumulative index of the difference of aquifer recharge, as calculated by a soil moisture balance method, and groundwater abstraction has a correlation coefficient of nearly one with model calculated storage. indicators based on the filling index derived from piezometric time series or on the ratio of aquifer discharge to recharge have slightly lower correlations. the accumulated index indicator can be used to follow aquifer storage in the future without the need to run the full groundwater flow model. this simple approximation is restricted to aquifer systems with a limited lateral inflow and outflow.

Vaquez-Sune et al.,2007,Ground Water,estimation of recharge from floods in disconnected stream aquifer systems,"stream aquifer interaction has been the subject of much research for cases of good hydraulic connection (continuous saturated zone) between a river and an aquifer. under these conditions, floods do not represent a very large net input to the aquifer because most of the water that enters the aquifer during the flood returns to the river when its stage recedes. the situation is different in disconnected stream aquifer systems, where the streambed lies above the water level in the aquifer, thus preventing return flow from the aquifer. under these conditions, floods may represent large, but hard to quantify, water inputs. here, we present a methodology to estimate recharge from floods for disconnected stream aquifer systems. recharge is estimated as the product of a flood time function (dependent on the streamflow) and an unknown factor, which is obtained from calibrating a groundwater flow model to aquifer heads. the approach can also benefit from concentration data, which can be very informative when river water concentrations vary over time. this methodology is applied to a field situation where recharge from river flooding is found to amount to nearly 15 million m(3)/year on the average, which represents 40% of the total aquifer inputs. recharge from flooding helps explain major head recoveries, suggesting that basin water management programs should allow some floods to occur."

White et al.,2010,Hydrogeology Journal,management of freshwater lenses on small pacific islands,"the nature of shallow aquifers and the impacts of seawater intrusion in small islands within the pacific ocean are reviewed. many pacific islands rely on shallow fresh groundwater lenses in highly permeable aquifers, underlain and surrounded by seawater, as their principal freshwater source. it is argued here that, in small islands, the nature of fresh groundwater lenses and their host aquifers coupled with frequent natural and ever present anthropogenic threats make them some of the most vulnerable aquifer systems in the world. a simple steady state approximation is used to provide insight into the key climatic, hydrogeological, physiographic, and management factors that influence the quantity of, and saline intrusion into freshwater lenses. examples of the dynamic nature of freshwater lenses as they respond to these drivers are given. natural and human related threats to freshwater lenses are discussed. long dry periods strongly coupled to sea surface temperatures impact on the quantity and salinity of fresh groundwater. the vulnerability of small island freshwater lenses dictates careful assessment, vigilant monitoring, appropriate development, and astute management. strategies to aid future groundwater sustainability in small islands are presented and suggested improvements to donor and aid programs in water are also advanced."
White et al.,2003,Episodes,long term sustainability of groundwater resources: an approach using integrated hydrogeological and economic models,"groundwater is an important but under utilised water resource. its use is growing. approaches to the management of groundwater are evolving, with sustainability as the current approach it? new zealand, and other countries. models of aquifer geometry, geology, groundwater flow, and groundwater quality are developed from observed data. these models are integrated using an economic model of groundwater use and groundwater quality to predict the total economic value of groundwater. this approach to modelling the sustainability of groundwater is demonstrated for the delta zone of the groundwater system it? the waimea plains, nelson, new zealand. four scenarios of use are investigated; actual, allocated, two times allocated and five times allocated. it is predicted that the economic value of irrigation from groundwater in the zone is $2 million with actual and allocated water usage. with use of two times allocated, the economic value of irrigation from groundwater is $3.5 million. the waimea river is predicted to be dry for at least one week in a dry year with this scenario. the economic value of irrigation from groundwater is  $1.3 million with water use of five times irrigation. this economic loss is due to land being taken out of production because of saltwater intrusion, and the costs of moving a water supply system caused by predicted saltwater intrusion. this research provides key information to assist the water management agency in setting allocation limits for groundwater resources."
Winter et al.,2007,Journal of the American Water Resources Association,role of groundwater in generating streamflow in headwater areas and in maintaining base flow,"the volume and sustainability of streamflow from headwaters to downstream reaches commonly depend on contributions from groundwater. streams that begin in extensive aquifers generally have a stable point of origin and substantial discharge in their headwaters. in contrast, streams that begin as discharge from rocks or sediments having low permeability have a point of origin that moves up and down the channel seasonally, have small incipient discharge, and commonly go dry. nearly all streams need to have some contribution from groundwater in order to provide reliable habitat for aquatic organisms. natural processes and human activities can have a substantial effect on the flow of streams between their headwaters and downstream reaches. streams lose water to groundwater when and where their head is higher than the contiguous watertable. although very common in and regions, loss of stream water to groundwater also is relatively common in humid regions. evaporation, as well as transpiration from riparian vegetation, causing groundwater levels to decline also can cause loss of stream water. human withdrawal of groundwater commonly causes streamflow to decline, and in some regions has caused streams to cease flowing."
Won et al.,2006,Hydrogeology Journal,"groundwater occurrence on jeju island, korea","jeju island is a volcanic island composed predominantly of permeable basalts. the island is poor in surfacewater but abundant in groundwater. no actual perennial streams exist and the water resources on the island are dependent almost entirely on groundwater. the groundwater bodies on the island are classified into three general categories: high level, basal and parabasal groundwaters. the parabasal groundwater is further subdivided into lower and upper parabasal groundwaters due to the position of the seogwipo formation, which is made up of sedimentary rocks with a low permeability. the distribution of each groundwater type was evaluated through analyses of the spatial distribution of the seogwipo formation and the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater. basal groundwater emerges extensively along the coast of the eastern sector, less commonly along the coast of the western sector. parabasal groundwater occurs extensively over most of the island except for the southern sector, where it occurs only locally in the coastal area. this paper presents a summary of several studies on the occurrence and features of groundwater resources on jeju island, the largest island in korea."
Wu et al.,2007,Hydrogeology Journal,optimizing groundwater development strategies by genetic algorithm: a case study for balancing the needs for agricultural irrigation and environmental protection in northern china,"gaoqing plain is a major agriculture center of shandong province in northern china. over the last 30 years, the diversion of yellow river water for intensive irrigation in gaoqing plain has led to elevation of the watertable and increased evaporation, and subsequently, a dramatic increase in salt content in soil and rapid degradation of crop productivity. optimal strategies have been explored, that will balance the need to extract sufficient groundwater for irrigation (to ease the pressure on diverting yellow river water) with the need to improve the local environment by appropriately lowering the watertable. two simulation optimization models have been formulated and a genetic algorithm (ga) is applied to search for the optimal groundwater development strategies in gaoqing plain, while keeping the adverse environmental impacts in check. compared with the trial and error approach of previous studies, the optimization results demonstrate that using an optimization model coupled with a ga search is both effective and efficient. the optimal solutions identified by the ga will provide gaoqing plain with the blueprints for developing sustainable groundwater abstraction plans to support local economic development and improve its environmental quality."
Wu et al.,2005,Environmental Geology,application of grey numerical model to groundwater resource evaluation,"based on interval grey number theory, a grey numerical model was developed to simulate groundwater flow in two dimensional porous medium aquifer. the solution method proposed in this paper ensures the integrity and validity of the grey data transportation in the calculation processes. because most of the parameters characterizing groundwater flow are of grey nature, a grey model can better describe the groundwater flow than the traditional ""white"" model. the method was applied to evaluate the sustainable groundwater resource in a groundwater basin of north china. the results from the case study help develop the most appropriate approaches to utilize the water resources in the area."
Xu et al.,2005,Agricultural Water Management,analysis on groundwatertable drawdown by landuse and the quest for sustainable water use in the hebei plain in china,"increased water use in the hebei plain during the last decades has caused serious groundwater level decline and many geological problems which have become the biggest threat to social economic sustainability. thus, to determine the factors resulting in the groundwater decline and to develop a practical plan for long term groundwater use appear to be necessary in this region. in this paper, a waterbalance model is used in conjunction with regression techniques to estimate the groundwater recharge coefficient and the specific yield (defined as the ratio of the volume of water that a saturated rock or soil will release by gravity drainage to the volume of rock or soil) and the groundwater withdrawn by different water use sectors and the corresponding drop in the watertable are analyzed. the decline in watertable by different crops and water economic benefit of crops are discussed in detail in order to suggest sustainable use of groundwater resources in the hebei plain. finally, sample policy scenarios are developed to show how groundwater in the hebei plain could be used in a sustainable manner. in our study, it is found that agriculture is the major consumer of groundwater, with about 85% of the total groundwater withdrawals, and groundwater depletion is mainly caused by agricultural water use. production of winter wheat exerts a great negative influence on the groundwater system. winter wheat is the most water consuming crop and result in significant decline of groundwatertable. water economic benefit of winter wheat is lower than that of other crops and withdrawing winter wheat sown area is rational option to make sustainable use of groundwater. with far sighted and regional planning, the limited water resource can be used sustainably to generate maximum social benefits. this paper will provide information necessary for landuse planning in a severe water shortage region where farmland is mainly irrigated by groundwater.

Yang et al.,2001,Hydrological Sciences Journal-Journal Des Sciences Hydrologiques,multi objective optimization for sustainable groundwater resource management in a semiarid catchment,"groundwater is an important water resource and its management is vital for integrated water resources development in semiarid catchments. the river shiyang catchment in the semiarid area of northwestern china was studied to determine a sustainable multi objective management plan of water resources. a multi objective optimization model was developed which incorporated water supplies, groundwater quality, ecology, constraints. a calibrated groundwater flow model was supplemented by grey simulation of groundwater quality, thus providing two lines of evidence to use in the multi objective water management. the response matrix method was used to link the groundwater simulation models and the optimization model. multi phase linear programming was used to minimize and compromise the objectives for the multi period, conjunctive water use optimization management plan was able to meet ecological, overall water deficit within the catchment."
Yidana et al.,2008,Ksce Journal of Civil Engineering,"groundwater resources management in the afram plains area, ghana","a groundwater flow simulation model was developed using available hydrogeological data to describe groundwater flow in the afram plains area. a nonlinear optimization model was then developed and solved for the management of groundwater resources to meet irrigation and household needs. the objective was to maximize groundwater extraction from the shallow aquifers of the southern voltaian sedimentary basin that underly the area, for irrigation activities. this would improve food security, raise the standard of living and ultimately help towards poverty alleviation in the rural communities that constitute the afram plains district. the calibrated flow model is in tandem with the general hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the area and fits the observed data with about 98% degree of confidence. the study reveals that groundwater resources, if fully developed, may not be the limiting factor in the development of the irrigation industry, and has tremendous potential to meet current and future irrigation needs. six groundwater management periods (january 2007 december 2013) were used for the study, with the quantity of irrigable land available, and the groundwater level drawdown as the main constraints that limit the maximization of groundwater extraction from wells for irrigation and household purposes. maize was used as the single irrigation crop because maize appears to be the staple food and farmers are familiar with it in the area. it was determined from this pilot study, that profit from maize irrigation in the afram plains area could rise from us$ 301,000 in 2007 to over us$ 3.5million at the end of the last management period (2013) as irrigation practice is improved, and the economic strength to increase the acreage for irrigation improves. even with these margins of profit, the drawdown constraint was not reached in any of the management periods. it is expected that recharge from the irrigation water would reclaim the lost hydraulic head. the single significant constraint was the amount of land area that could be developed for irrigation in the area. the profit obtained per unit cubic meter of water used also improved over the same management period."
Yidana et al.,2008,Environmental Geology,groundwater availability in the shallow aquifers of the southern voltaian system: a simulation and chemical analysis,"a steady state groundwater flow simulation model was developed using available well data and general hydrogeological and geological information, for the afram plains area, ghana. the hydrochemistry of groundwater from wells in the area was then evaluated to determine its suitability for irrigation and domestic uses. the assessment of the irrigation quality of groundwater from this area was based on salinity (ec) and sodium adsorption ratios (sar), residual sodium carbonate (rsc), and permeability indices (pi). the simulation model reveals that groundwater in the afram plains area generally flows from the midsections in the neighborhood of tease and surrounding areas, where significant recharge takes place, to the outer regions and discharges into the volta lake in the southern and eastern sections of the area. flow magnitude and piezometric maps suggest that there is probably of less potential for groundwater extraction for sustainable irrigation in the central regions of the area, when compared to the other discharge areas. this study reveals that more than 70% of the samples analyzed fall within the c2 s1 category, referring to the medium level salinity and low sodium. medium salinity waters may be used for irrigation on coarse textured soils with good permeability. about 15% of the data fall within the c3 s2 category, referring to water of high salinity and medium sodicity. high salinity, medium sodicity irrigation water cannot be used on fine grained soils where drainage is restricted. this is because restricted flow is likely to result in the accumulation of salts in the root zones of crops, leading to salinity and soil clogging crisis. about 3% falls within the c3 s3 (high salinity, high sodicity) category. this category requires special soil management including improved drainage, heavy leaching and the use of chemical amendments on the water. only one point plots within the extreme salinity sodicity range. concentrations of fluoride, arsenic and other natural elements in the area generally fall well within the world health standards for domestic water."

Zeitoun et al.,2009,Ground Water,asymmetric abstraction and allocation: the israeli palestinian water pumping record,"the increased attention given to international transboundary aquifers may be nowhere more pressing than on the western bank of the jordan river. hydropolitical analysis of six decades of israeli and palestinian pumping records reveals how groundwater abstraction rates are as asymmetrical as are water allocations. the particular hydrogeology of the region, notably the variability in depth to groundwater, variations in groundwater quality, and the vulnerability of the aquifer, also affect the outcome. the records confirm previously drawn conclusions of the influence of the agricultural lobby in maintaining a supply side water management paradigm. comparison of water consumption rates divulges that water consumed by all sectors of the farming based palestinian economy is less than half of israeli domestic consumption. the overwhelming majority of ""reserve"" flows from wet years are sold at subsidized rates to the israeli agricultural sector, while very minor amounts are sold at normal rates to the palestinian side for drinking water. an apparent coevolution of water resource variability and politics serves to explain increased israeli pumping prior to negotiations in the early 1990s. the abstraction record from the western aquifer basin discloses that the effective limit set by the terms of the 1995 oslo ii agreement is regularly violated by the israeli side, thereby putting the aquifer at risk. the picture that emerges is one of a transboundary water regime that is much more exploitative than cooperative and that risks spoiling the resource as it poisons international relations."
Zhang et al.,2006,Journal of Hydrologic Engineering,"determination of sustainable yield in urban groundwater systems: beijing, china","the city of beijing has long term concerns over the sustainable yield from its groundwater aquifers. the aquifers provide half of the city's water supply and have seen falling watertables over the past century. the sustainable yield of aquifers below urban beijing is assessed based on changes to the groundwaterbudget equation from virgin conditions. sources of anthropogenic recharge, including leakage from water mains and sewer pipes, seepage from septic tanks, irrigation, gardening, and artificial recharge, are together as large as changes to the groundwater flux as a result of groundwater withdrawals. changes to natural recharge, and to a lesser extent natural discharge, also significantly impact the waterbudget. uncertainty persists in several components of the budget equation, in particular changes to the groundwater flux. estimates of the upper and lower bounds for sustainable yield are relatively unchanged for the years 2000, 2010, and 2015. however, the components of the budget will change as seepage from septic tanks is expected to decrease. uncertainty in the likely range of sustainable yield is reduced by conducting monte carlo simulations. the simulations indicate there is a 96% chance that the lower pumping rate established in 1990 is sustainable. however, with between 30 and 60% of the waterbudget provided by treated or untreated wastewater, there must be long term concerns over the quality of the groundwater supply."

Zhou et al.,2009,Journal of Hydrology,"a critical review of groundwaterbudget myth, safe yield and sustainability","the principle of waterbalance is well known, but its application often causes controversy. one recent debate is the use of the waterbalance equation to determine the safe yield and sustainable yield. two extreme opinions exist on natural groundwater recharge. one misconception is that the development of groundwater is considered to be safe if the pumping rate does not exceed the rate of natural recharge. another is that the sustainable pumping rate has nothing to do with natural recharge, but depends on the increased recharge and decreased discharge (called capture) induced by pumping. the truth is that both the natural recharge and dynamic development of the capture determine the safe yield or sustainable yield of a groundwater basin. this paper clarifies the waterbudget controversy and uses the waterbalance equation to critically analyse the concepts of safe yield and sustainable yield. numerical simulation of a hypothetical case was used to demonstrate the natural groundwaterbalance, effects of pumping and the dynamic development of the capture.

Zlotnik et al.,2008,Journal of Hydrologic Engineering,stream depletion by groundwater pumping in leaky aquifers,"we present a simple approach to assess stream depletion by groundwater pumping in aquifers with leakage from an underlying source bed. the hydrogeological setting consists of a leaky aquifer that is hydraulically connected to a stream of shallow penetration. under such conditions, the pumping rate is partially supported by the depletion of an adjacent stream. we quantify this phenomenon by deriving explicit analytical solutions that elucidate the interplay among the streambed, aquifer, aquitard, and well parameters. in particular, our solutions demonstrate how both hydraulic stream aquifer connection and hydrostratigraphic conditions determine the possible fraction of the pumping rate supplied by the stream depletion. in leaky aquifers, this fraction decreases exponentially with the distance between a stream and a pumping well and is attenuated by a factor that depends on the streambed, aquifer, and aquitard parameters. the balance of pumping rate is supplied from recharge zone of the source bed."
